"To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit."
"To return to its past glory, it must reacquaint itself with the hatred of this world."
"Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master."
Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the song of your grandeur.
"The blade will feed on the ire of Tamriel. Bathe in your infamy. Feel the weight of their loathing, and my power will course through it once more."
"Excellent work, child."
I can feel their heartbreak swelling in my blade.
Their tears shine the ebony to a sharpest gleam.
"Ah, the blood of deceit is a nourishing flow."
"At last, my blade is returned to its full glory."
"Now go forth, child. Continue your tiny subversions against the orders of trust and intimacy."
"The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of children is ultimately too limited for my purposes."
"You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable."
I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore.
"I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers."
"I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal."
"You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences."
And those winds issue from my whispers.
Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them.
Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me.
"That one right there, walking out the door. He was one of them asking about that old man you're looking for."
"You know, since Kodlak's funeral the Skyforge feels more... awake."
It's always been said that the souls of the heroes of old are what give Skyforge steel its strength.
"But I think the forge knows the greatness of Kodlak's soul. I can't really explain, but it feels like it's... young."
I'll wager it could now forge metal the likes of which hasn't been seen since eras long forgotten.
I'm eager to try.
Let's go!
"With me, up the tower!"
"This way, friend! Move!"
We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!
"Hadvar! Into the keep, soldier, we're leaving!"
"Assorted books, scrolls... I'm sure you'll find something useful."
I have a few things laying around that weren't worth adding to the collection. You may look through them.
"Please make sure your hands are clean before touching anything, all right?"
Good. Let's get this over with.
Shut up back there!
"It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric!"
Halt!
As fearless in death as he was in life.
It's in the clouds!
"The finest skooma, the sweetest moon sugar. At a fair price, of course."
No need to get so... hostile. Just take it. Sounds like you need it more than I do.
Yeah... That's not going to happen.
"Ah, a snitch, eh? Can't have you running to any guards now, can I?"
Each has their own way.
Beem! What are you doing? Stop it!
Father never trusted Beem. I always thought he was just being overprotective.
"Oh, Beem..."
"Hey now, don't take all the good stuff!"
"These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing stones that dot Skyrim's landscape."
"Go ahead, see for yourself."
"Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge."
"Thief, eh? It's never too late to take charge of your own fate, you know."
"Warrior, good! I knew you shouldn't have been on that cart the minute I laid eyes on you."
"These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing stones that dot Skyrim's landscape."
"Go ahead, see for yourself."
"Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge."
"Thief, eh? It's never too late to take charge of your own fate, you know."
"Warrior, good! Those stars will guide you to honor and glory."
"With me, prisoner. Let's go!"
See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we can get.
Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.
Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow screamed for weeks.
"You're not sweet-talking your way out of this. Not after what you did. You're headed to Cidhna Mine, and that's that."
"All right, but you just watch yourself. Next time, I might not be so lenient."
I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the job.
"Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later."
Ralof! You damned traitor. Out of my way!
"We're escaping, Hadvar. You're not stopping us this time."
Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.
"You! Come on, into the keep!"
"Come on, this way!"
Through here. Let's go!
I can cut you loose inside. Come on!
"Well met again, Hunter."
So you may think.
"Not a failure, my servant."
"By bringing down my other Hunters, you turned the chase inside out."
And they were no base prey.
"You continue to amuse and impress. Go forth, with my blessing."
Legends don't burn down villages.
"Haming, get over here!"
"Just walk towards me, come on!"
Don't look up. Just focus on me. You can do it!
What are you doing? Get off the road!
"Get off the road, boy!"
Beem-Ja!
"Oh, Beem-Ja. I never meant for this. What have I done?"
You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward.
Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it.
"If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do."
"I see. It probably doesn't even matter now, what with the mess that's been made in here."
I'll add this to the rest of the items. I don't think there's anything further I need from you.
Justice!
Death to the Stormcloaks!
You Imperial bastards!
Get going!
Move!
What are you waiting for? Go!
"They're hurt, but they'll live."
We'll have to carry this one on our backs....
"Another second out there with the dragon, and they'd both be dead...."
Certainly! Glad to see you have the task well at hand.
"Not entirely true, though not entirely false either."
"Any Nord can learn the Way of the Voice by studying with the Greybeards, given enough ambition and dedication."
My shouting Torygg to the ground proved he had neither.
"However, it was my sword piercing his heart that killed him."
And speak to Eorlund if you want a better weapon than... whatever that is.
"You've done it! The College is safe again, thanks to your work."
"I knew you had it in you. I daresay the Psijics are right. There's no one more deserving to be Arch-Mage, in my opinion."
"Here, consider these yours. And the Arch-Mage's quarters as well. I shall be here for advice, should you need me."
Members of the College -- your new Arch-Mage!
Long live the Arch-Mage!
Congratulations!
"Well done, well done indeed!"
Glory to the Arch-Mage!
Hooray for the Arch-Mage!
Let's cut you loose.
"Come on, you need your hands free."
Those binds aren't going to cut themselves.
Let's cut you loose.
"Come on, you need your hands free."
Those binds aren't going to cut themselves.
You there. I have questions for you.
"You were in Saarthal, yes? It has come to my attention that something was found there."
I know full well that you have. Please do not insult my intelligence.
"Tolfdir is still there now, is he? I shall expect a full report when he returns."
"I am well aware. Tolfdir is still in Saarthal, is he? I shall be expecting a full report from him when he returns."
It is my job to know these things.
My role as advisor to the Arch-Mage is aided by knowing everything that transpires here.
"Something was discovered in Saarthal that was significant enough that Tolfdir sent a new member of the College, alone, to deliver word."
That sounds precisely like the sort of thing that should matter to everyone. Especially me.
Thank you for your help. You may go now.
What?
"Preposterous, and just the sort of thing I would expect from mages who have nothing better to do with their time."
I have made it quite clear that my only role here is as an advisor to the Arch-Mage.
I would suggest that you not further spread this rumor.
I know I don't like the way he looks at me.
"I can't tell if he expects me to blow myself up, or to try and murder him. But he clearly doesn't trust any of us."
"I know he's from the Thalmor, and that he claims to be here simply as an advisor."
"I also know that no one really believes that. I've been trying to avoid him, honestly."
"He's asked far, far too many questions about my research."
I think the Thalmor are trying to steal my work!
"I haven't told him anything, of course. What I'm doing is far too important. Can't breathe a word of it."
Don't trust that one. He's up to something.
"Most here are up to something, of course, but in his case, it's not good."
"I haven't figured it out yet, but I will."
"He is rather handsome though, isn't he?"
Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?
"Up through the tower, let's go!"
Has everyone here forgotten their training? Kill that thing!
Damn you mages! Aren't you good for anything?
I want every arrow in the sky!
Keep firing!
"Lead with those arrows, dammit!"
There you are. I've been trying to find you.
I just wanted to let you know that Ancano's been asking about you. I think he's looking for you.
"I'm not sure. Just... Well, mind what you tell him, all right?"
"Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this [QUOTE]advisor[QUOTE] position he has is a sham, an excuse."
"That what he's really doing is spying for the Thalmor, trying to feed them information. Whether it's true, I can't say."
"But it never hurts to be a little suspicious, does it?"
"No, no. Well, I don't think so."
You're welcome.
Of course. That's your choice. I just wanted to let you know.
I suppose it would be. Good thinking.
As you wish.
"Yes, General Tullius."
Give them their last rites.
"Hey, what village are you from horse thief?"
Why do you care?
A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.
Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.
"Funny, when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe."
This way!
"Does it involve sneaking and stabbing? Ooh, please say yes!"
Just name it.
"Of course, Listener. What is it?"
That's right.
Thanks for wasting my time.
This is it men!
This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim.
This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him.
"But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people."
"By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!"
"Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!"
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
It's true about the dragons returning. Saw it with my own eyes.
Thank you for your kindness.
"Thank you for the gold, traveler."
That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.
"Then you've seen them, too. We lost our home, our livestock... We barely have enough gold to get by."
No. I was too afraid to look. I don't know what we're going to do now. We have nothing left.
I'd stay away if I were you.
I'm on my way to a giant camp and I can't guarantee those beasts won't think you're part of the offering.
Keep your distance and you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
My wife's going to kill me when I tell her we'll need to bring another cow.
"Either way this ends up, I'm headed to the inn."
I'm headed to the inn.
It's tradition. We mark the animal as a way to let the giants know we're giving it to them willingly. Sort of a peace offering.
I have everything under control. Thanks for offering.
"The cow, of course. Others do it differently, but I've found that an annual offering usually keeps the giants away from our livestock."
"Some think it's superstition, but I believe it works. I've yet to have a giant kill any of my livestock."
"Thanks. You take care of yourself, now."
"I have nothing to say to you. Now move along, or I'll order my guards to attack."
"Keep away. If I am harmed, people will come looking."
This projection should be lit up like the night sky...
Have you ever seen the Orrery in the Imperial City? It was the inspiration for this idea.
"Instead of projecting the sky, we project all of Tamriel, and then harness the latent energies to overlay the positions of..."
Important deliveries to make! No time for chatting!
"Greetings, brother. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested."
"Greetings, sister. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested."
"Nice doing business with you, friend."
"This one has something sweet for the fellow traveler, if it entices."
There's been word of some trouble nearby. I'm on my way to investigate.
Now I have some time to kill...
"I probably shouldn't tell everyone who asks. This is important business, you know."
"If you really want to do my job for me... Here, I'll mark the location on your map."
"No, I think I've got this one. Thanks, though."
"All right, all right! No need to get violent. We're on the same side."
I'll mark it on your map. This one's on you.
"Someone's going to get hurt, all right."
You want to pay me to do my job? Fine. I'll mark the location on your map.
Just make sure to take care of whatever's going on there. It's my name on the line.
"Why? What are you gonna do, cry?"
What's a milk drinker like you doing out here? Go home to your mother.
Get out of my face.
Who said anything about trouble? Now get out of my face.
"Gods, you're boring!"
I think we're done here.
"Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment."
"Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary."
"Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too."
"Of course, I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin."
"Long as you clean up. You know how to use it right? Mix a couple of ingredients together, see what happens."
"A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know."
"We have plenty of ingredients for sale, too."
"Yes, actually. How about you smith me an iron dagger? Here's everything you need to make one. Go ahead."
"Not bad, but it's a little dull. How about you sharpen it up? Just need a bit of metal and the grindstone over there."
"This looks good. You put time into your blades, they'll serve you well when you need them."
You want to keep helping? How about you make some armor? Let's start by tanning some leather on the rack.
"Ah, good. A lot of weapons and armor need leather for straps, fittings, that kind of thing."
Let's see if you can make a hide helmet. Here's the rest of what you need.
I should hire you to be my assistant at this rate.
Let's improve the fit. Take this leather to the workbench over there.
"You have talent. Keep working at your craft, and you'll be a fine smith one day."
"Why don't you keep that dagger and helmet? Maybe you'll remember me when you're making Skyforge Steel, huh?"
"Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise."
"Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise."
"Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?"
Lead the way.
Once more into danger!
I'm ready to go!
My blade is yours once more.
"Good, I can use the exercise. Haha!"
"Alright, then. Let's go."
"You've been a worthy patron. Shall I join you once more, free of charge?"
"I could really use some more experience in the field. I'd be happy to join you again, and it won't cost a thing."
"Back for more? Since we had so much fun the last time, I'll join you free of charge."
"If you still need my blade, I'll join you. I want to make sure you get your money's worth."
"Since you paid my fee recently, I suppose it's only fair that I join you once more."
I'm bored. What do you say we go smash a few heads in? This one's on me.
I'm... I'm not sure what happened.
"A monk from the Psijic Order, here, after all these years, and then he just leaves."
I hope we didn't offend him somehow.
"Beyond asking for you, he never said. Very strange indeed."
"You better get that armor on. Give that sword a few swings, too."
"Sure, take all my things. Please."
It's locked. See if you can get it open with some picks. We might need that gold once we get out.
Grab anything useful and let's go.
"All right, get that armor on and give that axe a few swings."
"Come on, soldier. Keep moving!"
Let's see here....
"Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind..."
"It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else."
"He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before."
"But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident."
"Do you remember what I first told you, about how not being able to control magic could destroy you?"
I didn't simply mean it could kill you. The Augur's accident is another very real type of a life destroyed.
"Well, it's been described as an accident. I can't imagine it was intentional."
"Something must've gone wrong, and he ended up in the state he's in now, fused to the energies that flow through the College."
"I've never felt it appropriate to ask him about it, about how that must feel. Or, I suppose, if he can feel at all."
We lost everything.
"There are dragons about, traveler. Be warned."
"It happened so fast. One minute the dragon was there, the next it was gone. Everything was destroyed."
"Thank you, traveler. Be safe and don't forget to keep an eye on the sky."
You're too kind. Thank you. Be careful and stay safe.
But first... dir ko maar.
"You will die in terror, knowing your final fate..."
Know that Gormlaith sent you down to death!
Hyah!
"I don't know. It's like a ward, but who's casting it? Ancano? How?"
"Run, you idiot!"
Thought I told you to run for it! Go!
"Soldiers, townspeople, and dregs into the keep!"
Everyone to the keep!
To the keep! Move!
"What? Do you want to be that thing's next meal? Into the keep, already!"
"I hope you're Dragonborn, I really do. But we'll find out soon enough."
"We may both end up dead, but at least it gets me out of Riverwood. I don't really think I'm cut out for the quiet life."
"I doubt the Thalmor are aware of you yet. So we should be safe from them, at least."
"Remember, we're not looking for trouble. We need to get to Kynesgrove as fast as we can."
Keep a sharp lookout. We can't afford any delays.
We'd better keep moving.
Better to stick together. I don't want you to get yourself killed before we even get there.
"This is notorious bandit hideout. But it's also the shortest way to Kynesgrove, so... we may have to kill a few bandits."
We'll cross to the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then we can swing south to Kynesgrove.
"There's an inn at Kynesgrove - the Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping Giant, of course."
This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. The innkeeper ought to be able to tell us if there's any dragon mound nearby.
This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. Let's see if we can find that dragon mound.
No need to bother with giants right now. Just keep your distance.
I'm glad you were willing to trust me. I know it probably wasn't the best way to introduce myself. But old habits... you know.
Not too much farther now. Kynesgrove is just down the road to the southeast of here.
(muffled grunts)
"You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos, and now the Empire is going to put you down, and restore the peace."
"Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?"
"You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there."
Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.
"If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell."
You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
"We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief."
"Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me."
"Well, well. Looks like one of the Dark Brotherhood rats escaped its burning nest. I can fix that."
"To arms, brothers! It's the assassin!"
The Dark Brotherhood is dead... and so are you!
You want the Emperor? You'll have to get through us!
You'll never reach the Emperor! Not while I'm standing!
"It all ends here, assassin!"
"You'll never leave this ship alive, cutthroat!"
"All that effort, and you just kill her. You've ruined everything."
This is the East Empire Company's central warehouse. All of their shipments go through here.
"Unfortunately, thanks to some problems they've been having, it hasn't seen much use lately."
"Either way, it's off limits to you."
This is the East Empire Company's central warehouse. All of their shipments go through here.
"And now that they've solved their little pirate problem, they're busier than ever."
"Either way, it's off limits to you."
How should I know? I don't work for them.
"If you want to help, I suppose you could head to Windhelm and talk to Orthus Endario. He's in charge over there."
The warehouse is off-limits. I suggest you head back the way you came.
"There's nothing for you in the warehouse, so why don't you take a walk?"
The warehouse is for East Empire Company workers only. Entering without permission is a crime.
Yearrgh!
Hyargh!
Rrarggh!
Oblivion take you!
Fall before me!
You will bleed!
Grrragh!
Hunh!
Gah!
Yah!
Rargh!
Agh!
Oof!
Nargh!
Yeagh!
Hhyyaarargghhhh!
Rrrraaaaarrggghhhh!
Nnyyyaarrgghh!
No... not by a mortal...
It cannot... end like this...
Aggh...
Agh...
Ugh...
Gah...
Are you prepared for your death?
"You are weak, mortal."
I honor my lord by destroying you!
I will feast on your heart.
Gah!
Nargh!
Unf!
Nnh!
Now you suffer!
"You return, foolish mortal?"
I smell weakness...
A challenger is near...
No one escapes!
"There you are, weakling!"
Quiet again.
Nothing after all.
"You meet your end, mortal."
Another who seeks death.
There could be no other end.
No match at all.
You cannot escape me!
Hiding will not save you now.
"Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted."
You can't kill what you can't see!
I've mastered the shadows... and now your life is mine!
"Come, [QUOTE]Nightingale![QUOTE] Find me if you can!"
Karliah's taught you nothing! Your lessons begin anew!
I should've finished you when I had the chance!
Get the damn Key and let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
Hmm. The gate below still looks closed.
"I've seen a puzzle like this before... there's got to be another lever to pull, but you'd better hurry. A septim says this mechanism's on a timer."
"Oh, well, the Listener is the only person the Night Mother speaks to. It is the highest honor attainable by a member of the Dark Brotherhood."
"Of course our Lady is dead, so she doesn't talk with words, since her lips are... rotted. But inside the Listener's head. I hear it's... intimate."
"Ah, but there has not been a Listener in years and years. Our Lady has not chosen Cicero, and certainly not Astrid. Or... anyone. But some day..."
"Ha! Why you are, silly! You are the Listener! You are the Listener! Such a kidder..."
You must realize what a great honor this is. For the Night Mother to have chosen you... I am just in awe. You have Cicero's utmost confidence!
"I think you've been taking things that don't belong to you. Pay your debts, and we'll forget this happened."
Hold your head up. I'm sure it won't happen again.
Now that's just sad. Come back when you actually have something to show for your thieving.
Be careful around here. You don't want to anger the wrong person.
"We may be rough, but we don't tolerate thieving around here. If that's your game, go join the lowlives in Riften."
I'll stay here and wait for General Tullius. Good luck you two.
I'll stay here and wait for General Tullius. Good luck you two.
I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
How dare you!
It's very unfortunate that you've been suspended.
I have no more business with you.
"People think they can run away from their crimes, but I will always catch up with them and make them pay."
Stop right there.
"You have quite the bounty on your head in Eastmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in Falkreath. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in Haafingar. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in Hjaalmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in The Pale. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in The Reach. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in The Rift. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in Whiterun. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"You have quite the bounty on your head in Winterhold. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared."
"I will make sure this gets back to the Jarl. Minus my cut, of course. Consider your name cleared, for now."
Then you are worth more to me dead!
This way. Come on!
There's a way out through here!
We have to keep moving.
This way. Come on!
There's a way out through here!
We have to keep moving.
You better get some gear.
See if one of these chests has some armor for you.
Got to be a sword or two in one of these chests. Look around.
Grab Gunjar's gear. No shame in borrowing a friend's axe.
Gunjar isn't coming back from the dead. Take his armor and anything else on him.
That armor on Gunjar isn't doing him any good. Go ahead. Take it.
Dragon!
Get these prisoners out of the carts. Move it!
Archers!
You're not going to kill me!
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Black Marsh.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Morrowind.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to the Summerset Isle.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Cyrodiil.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Elsweyr.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Orsinium.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Hammerfell.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Valenwood.
"I'm sorry. At least you'll die here, in your homeland."
"By your orders, Captain."
"By the way, if you're looking for something to do..."
"No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening."
And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.
"General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!"
(bark)
(woof)
(bark)
(woof)
"Don't delay, Shield-Brother."
"Don't delay, Shield-Sister."
"As a matter of fact, there are. Have you ever heard of Shalidor?"
"Immensely powerful mage, back in the First Era. Had an understanding of magic few have ever matched."
"He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible."
"Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can."
I'm always trying to find more of Shalidor's writings.
"I've heard whispers of more of his work having turned up. If you can track it down, it may prove useful to all of us."
Excellent!
I'll start translating it. Shouldn't take me more than a day or two.
"Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor."
Where in Oblivion are we supposed to go? Where's the way out?
Just give me a minute. Let me think.
Orders are to wait until General Tullius arrives.
I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon! We need to fall back!
Just give the General some time!
What are you doing? We need to get out of Helgen. Now!
These Imperials have potions in here. We're going to need them.
Grab everything important and let's move! Dragon's burning everything to the ground!
I just need to gather some more potions.
In here!
This way! Come on!
Over here!
By Ysmir! Nothing kills it!
What in the Eight Divines is this thing?
Keep your eyes on it!
It's still coming!
"Die! For the love of the gods, die!"
Use everything we have!
"Fall, damn you, fall!"
What does it take to kill this monster?
"It won't die, it just keeps coming!"
How does it move so damn fast?
Move! Move!
How in Oblivion do we kill this thing?
"Come on, this way."
Let's keep moving.
Looks like the way out's up ahead. Come on.
Follow me.
Let's go.
We better keep going.
Over here!
"This way, come on!"
Don't fall behind!
Stormcloaks! Get them!
The prisoners are escaping!
You won't leave Helgen alive!
Stormcloaks!
Stormcloaks! Filthy traitors!
Don't let those Stormcloaks get away!
"If you want to die, so be it."
You won't take us alive!
Freedom or Sovngarde!
For Ulfric and Skyrim!
Death to the Empire!
Imperial dogs!
So that's why you were in the cart. Thieving.
Dragon!
It's the End Times! The End Times have come!
"By the gods, a dragon! How?"
A dragon? It's a dragon! Gods help us!
What's happening?
Divines help us!
Step towards the block when we call your name. One at a time.
Empire loves their damn lists.
Wait. You there. Step forward.
"For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with."
"Come on, I haven't got all morning."
"My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?"
"Face your death with some courage, thief."
Ralof of Riverwood.
"No, I'm not a rebel. You can't do this!"
Anyone else feel like running?
There you go!
Pretty good arm you have there.
What? Did... you need something?
I have nothing to say to you. Just... leave me alone.
Muiri? I can't believe my family trusted that backstabbing little strumpet. You tell her she's dead to us. You hear me? Dead!
"What kind of cruel, horrible person are you? My sister was murdered. Do you have any idea what that's like? What I'm going through?"
"You just going to stand there, gawking? Go away. You're starting to... frighten me."
"I don't care who you're with. After what you did, you're lucky I'm not cutting you down where you stand!"
I can see it in your eyes - you've seen the land of the gods and returned.
Does this mean... is it done? Is Alduin truly defeated?
"At last. It is over. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end."
"Then it is done at last. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end."
"You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons."
Now it is up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill.
Will you be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages?
Or will your name be a curse to future generations?
"Or will you merely fade from history, unremembered?"
"Let the Way of the Voice be your guide, and the path of wisdom will be clear to you. Breath and focus, Dragonborn. Your future lies before you."
"Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like normal mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind."
He may be permitted to return at the end of time to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater.
But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part.
We heard the news from Whiterun - that you left the city on the back of a dragon!
"That's a little... showy, even for you."
Please... Delphine has been very worried about you.
"Since you're still alive, I assume you have good news to report?"
"We are all in your debt, Dragonborn."
Gods above... that's better news than I had hoped!
"When you walked into my inn that day, I never imagined where it would all lead... dragons out of legend... Sovngarde..."
You've done it... just as the prophecy said...
"I knew you could do it... I believed in you, and yet... I still didn't think I'd live to see this day."
"Thank you. Thank you, Dragonborn. You've done a great service for us all."
There's still the matter of Paarthurnax. I'm not ungrateful for what you've done. Esbern speaks for both of us.
But our oath as Blades binds us. Paarthurnax must die. There's no excuse now that Alduin is dead.
I'm afraid she's right. I'm deeply sorry that this has to come between us.
"But just as Paarthurnax's later deeds do not expiate his crimes, your deeds do not allow us to ignore our duty."
I hope you will return to us soon with the news that justice has finally been done.
"With both Alduin and Paarthurnax dead, a dark chapter in history will finally be closed."
"You what? How could you run out? J'zargo gave you more than enough. Bah, just forget J'zargo ever asked for your help."
"Come, let us share a cup of mead, and trade tales of our time on Mundus, reliving the glory of our remembered deeds."
A cup I'll gladly raise in company with you. None have yet bested me in boasting or drinking.
"I crave a tale of tall ships and fearless heroes, for heart's ease."
"Listen well, friend, and lighten your mood while words I'll spin of warriors bold, whose deeds of valor brought undying fame."
"Hail, comrade! Shall we by clash of steel ease the gloom of the encompassing mist?"
"My blade is restless, unblooded too long."
Aye. Let us forget our sorrow in the fury of battle.
Meat and mead must ever make way for the clash of steel - the song of battle.
"Well fought, friend. Your fury is unmatched."
"By a bold stroke, you bested me, friend."
"Shor's favor found me today. Let's lift a mug of mead together, our wounds to salve and weariness cure."
With mead and fellowship let's mend our wounds.
Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim.
"What're you doing here, Redguard? You a sellsword? A sailor from Stros M'kai?"
"You from one of the strongholds, Orc? How did you end up here?"
You're a long way from the Imperial City. What're you doing in Skyrim?
"You're not with the Thalmor Embassy, are you high elf? No, that can't be right...."
"Another refugee? Gods really have abandoned your people, dark elf."
"You from Daggerfall, Breton? Fleeing from some court intrigue?"
"You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit? Your kind always seems to find trouble."
"Are you a relative of one of the Riften dock workers, Argonian?"
"You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman."
We need to get moving! That dragon is tearing up the whole keep!
Just give me a minute... I'm out of breath...
Hear that? Stormcloaks. Maybe we can reason with them.
Yearrgh!
Hyargh!
Rrarggh!
Grrargh!
Aggghh!
Nyyarrggh!
Agh!
Oof!
Nargh!
Argh!
Weergh!
Yeagh!
I long to fight that foul worm.
Shall Alduin remain so long unchallenged?
"Ease your heart, our honor is unstained - it's by Shor's command we curb our onslaught."
It is by Shor's command that we curb our wrath - so let's feast and sing 'til our fate calls us.
"Let us not spurn our lord's bounty - this hall is his gift, for glory well-earned."
Honest pay for honest work.
"Your doom has come, damned worm!"
"Stand fast! The fell worm's death is ours at last, the light returns!"
Nowhere to hide! Hunter becomes our prey!
"Use Dragonrend, to drag him down!"
"Die, World-Eater, in despair and fear!"
"Today you die, your doom has come."
"Use Dragonrend, brothers! Bring him to swords-reach!"
"Down with you, damned worm!"
For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!
I've waited long for such a worthy opponent.
The joy of battle burns in your heart!
"The path is closed, till your courage is tested."
"Shor's Hall awaits, if worthy you prove."
"Prove worthy by warrior's test, and cross the bridge to the blessed hall."
"I may fall to your malice, but your fate is already written."
"You may strike me down, but your doom is near."
You cannot defeat us! The Dragonborn still stands!
Zu'u unslaad! Zu'u nis oblaan!
"The mist is gone, my mind is clear."
For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!
"Down with you, damned worm!"
"I'll fight and die, if such fate is mine."
"Better to die with blade in hand than feed his hunger, hopeless in the mist."
"No higher fate than fall in battle at Sovngarde's gates, a glorious end!"
"Before I fall, you'll feel the bite of my sharp blade, as Shor's my witness."
Nahl...
Daal...Vus!
By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and ventured not the vale's dark mist.
But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
"Gormlaith the fearless, glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the valiant, heavy-handed warrior; Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim."
Alduin's mist is more than a snare - its shadowy gloom is his shield and cloak.
"But with four Voices joined, our valor combined, we can blast the mist and bring him to battle."
"Felldir speaks wisdom - the World-Eater, coward, fears you, Dragonborn."
"We must drive away his mist, Shouting together, and then unsheathe our blades in desperate battle with our black-winged foe."
"To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war, our wills undaunted."
"Through fire and time, the terror has lived. No more, I say! I've set my heart on terrible deeds, death's grim art."
"Now ends this tale, my eternity be damned!"
"If it is our lot to end, we'll live in song if not in soul."
"At Sovngarde's gates I'll meet my fate with mirthful heart, and know I fell in noblest cause."
Tarry not too long - the land of the dead is not meant for mortals to linger.
"Return now to Nirn, with this rich boon from Shor, my lord: a Shout to bring a hero from Sovngarde in your hour of need."
Noooo!
Gaaaah!
Aaaaah!
"Yes, well. After the unfortunate incident that occurred, I think it's best if we just move on."
Nothing seems to work!
Keep it busy. I'll try to drain some of its power!
There! Now attack it!
You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take prisoners.
You were ranting when you got here  but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.
"I see. So you don't remember fondling the statuary, then?"
"Yes, your head hurts and you don't remember where you are."
"You know, things are really starting to move around here. I mean, look at the place. I've never seen so much merchandise."
"Yeah, it's really something else, isn't it?"
"At this rate, the Guild won't be such a laughingstock anymore."
I agree. It'll be nice to get back the respect we lost in the last few years.
Take a look around. Have you ever laid eyes on such wealth?
Never. This is the best the Guild's done since I've been a part of it.
How's the training going?
"Better than ever. With the Guild back on its feet, there's more coin to throw around. How about you?"
Couldn't be busier.
Let's just hope it stays this way for a long time.
So I'm finally seeing you with a smile on your face.
It's this place. It feels like home. It's just nice to finally have something going right in my life.
"No? Well, if you think you're capable of it, then I'd be happy to provide it to you for a mere 30 gold."
Or you can try your luck with one of the court wizards around Skyrim. They also sell spells.
Here you are. Now I'm anxious to see you cast it.
"Die, you dog!"
Death to the beastblood!
"I'll rip you apart, Companion!"
Ysgramor would be ashamed of you!
I can smell your shame!
Which one is that?
We knew you'd be coming here.
"Well, look what we have here."
"It's time to die, dog."
"Your mistake, Companion."
"It doesn't matter. She wears that armor, she dies."
"It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies."
Killing you will make for an excellent story.
None of you will be alive to tell it.
You're going to regret this.
"Markarth is... different from the rest of Skyrim, there's no doubt about that."
"The Reach has been part of Skyrim for a thousand years, but the Reachmen still haven't accepted it."
It was only 20 years back that the Reachmen rebelled. Even took control of Markarth itself for a time.
"They were crushed, of course, but the survivors - the Forsworn - still lurk in the wilds and make the Reach dangerous for honest folk."
"Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?"
By the nine!
"Well, King... If you don't mind, we'll just take that crown of yours and be on our way."
Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!
"Alright, get the crown off that draugr!"
"Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?"
"Ralof... get away from there, fool!"
By the nine!
"If you don't mind king, we'll just be taking that crown of yours and be on our way."
"Alright, get the crown off that draugr!"
Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!
"Ah well, it was a long shot."
Oh that's very sweet of you. Anything you can find out from Captain Aldis would be welcome news.
"Ah, well I guess it was unlikely. I'm sorry to waste your time."
"You're a traveller, correct? Have you been to Whiterun?"
Wonderful. I hadn't really hoped to run in to someone who had been there.
"My daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army.  I was hoping you might have met her."
I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help.
"Sure - take advantage of the guy in jail. Okay, fine. I can make the deal sweeter."
"I obviously don't have anything here, but... there's a hidden stash in the Lodge. And I did manage to hold on to the key..."
Take it.
"Nice try, but my mother's already got me in jail. Maybe you should try that one on Letrush."
"You're playing a dangerous game, my friend."
"Fine, you win. Take the horse and leave."
And telling her what? That you stole her horse? I don't think so.
"Now wait a minute... No need to do anything drastic. Look, Keep the horse, all right? Then we all walk away happy..."
"Well ain't that the truth of it. All right, then. Let's see what you've got!"
Get ready to open the trap!
"Done, then? This way!"
Done? Let's get moving.
It was good speaking with you again.
May the shadows guide your journey.
Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
"Now go and make us some coin, lad!"
"Now go and make us some coin, lass!"
I'm feeling a sense of inner peace... something I haven't felt in a very long time.
"Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment."
"Of course, I've been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and feel free to share the fruits of my labor."
"I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves."
The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed.
"If you wish to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no one would give it a second thought."
Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
"With Mercer Frey gone and our influence present in all of Skyrim's cities, the Guild's accumulating wealth faster than we can spend it."
"I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master."
Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
"With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't seen in decades."
"I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master."
It's as if the merchandise and coin are simply falling from the sky.
"Vex and Delvin are having to turn clients away at this point, it's almost impossible to keep up."
Don't forget to check your tribute chest once in a while. As Guild Master you're getting a significant cut of the spoils.
This next song goes out to the Dragonborn. The savior of Skyrim.
This is an ode to Skyrim's truest sons and daughters... the Stormcloaks.
This is an ode to Skyrim's staunch protectors... the Imperials.
This one's a favorite of mine. A legend we all know and love...
This is a local favorite and one of the first songs I ever learned. Ragnar the Red.
"I admit, I doubted you, but no more. You've made a dragon submit to your will. A feat to rival the legendary Olaf One-Eye! What glory!"
"Carry on, soldier. This is all part of the Dragonborn's plan."
May Kynareth guard you while you pass through her realm!
By all the gods...
"Faas nu, zini dein ruthi ahst vaal."
"You're either the bravest person I've ever met, or the biggest fool."
"Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin."
"Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity!"
"I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge."
"I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself."
Surely you wouldn't miss a few scales... or a small amount of blood...
Joor mey! What are you doing back there?
"Farengar! Enough, fool!"
"Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you."
"I'll be glad when this beast is gone from here. Do whatever it is you need to do with it, Dragonborn."
Werewolf!
By the gods! It... it can't be!
It's a werewolf! To arms! To arms!
"Just one. I know when I was found by my Argonian father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni."
"It was one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain."
"If you come across anything in your travels that might provide me with the answers I'm looking for, I'd be grateful."
Thank you.
I learned that a matron who had served for House Telvanni had escaped Morrowind during the Accession War.
"Records showed her buying passage aboard a sailing vessel named [QUOTE]The Pride of Tel Vos,[QUOTE] but that's where the trail ran cold."
"I spent years looking for what became of the ship, but I ended up empty-handed."
Let me see that!
"Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed."
"Please, let me offer you this key. It unlocks my strongbox under my stand in the marketplace. Help yourself to anything inside."
"I picked up a trick from a butcher in Elinhir, a small town over the border in Hammerfell."
"He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time."
"I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands."
"Thanks, I was actually worried I'd run out."
"Oh! Well if you change your mind, come back and see me."
"Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while."
"And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it."
"Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious."
The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent.
"Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there."
I have taught the Way of the Voice for centuries and the Thu'um since long before that.
"But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a hundred years."
I meditate on the Rotmulaag - the Words of Power. I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.
"Which calls to you, Dovahkiin? Fus, Feim, or Yol?"
"It is called [QUOTE]Force[QUOTE] in your tongue. But as you push the world, so does the world push back."
Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path.
That is [QUOTE]Fus.[QUOTE] Let its meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will push the world harder than it pushes back.
"[QUOTE]Fade[QUOTE] in your tongue. Mortals have greater affinity for this Word than the dov. Everything mortal fades away in time, but the spirit remains."
"Ponder the meaning of spirit. Unslaad zii. Where mortal flesh may wither and die, the spirit endures."
That is [QUOTE]Feim.[QUOTE] Let that meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will find that your spirit will give you more strength.
"In your tongue, the Word simply means [QUOTE]Fire.[QUOTE] It is change given form. Power at its most primal."
"That is the true meaning of [QUOTE]Yol.[QUOTE] Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power is inert without action and choice."
"Think of this as the fire builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What will you burn? What will you spare?"
"Maybe you're not so soft, after all. Now you're ready for a real challenge."
"I'll anoint you with the symbol of the Bear, the Sabrecat and the Mammoth. Tread carefully, these are mighty beasts."
"The guardian spirits of Bear, Mammoth and Sabre Cat await you. Return when they are defeated."
Kyne's guardian troll awaits you. Complete this trial and you'll have proven yourself a true hunter.
You do Kyne proud. Only one challenge remains. Go and defeat the troll champion.
"Then you finally know what it means to be a true hunter, in the Nord way."
"For this you have earned the Blessing of Kyne, and can count me as a friend."
Go with the gods.
Talos watch over you.
Take care.
Be careful out there.
"Keep your brother, and he'll keep you."
As you were.
Hmph.
Watch yourself.
"Go on, get out of here."
Dismissed.
You're dismissed.
"No. Gods no, not for years."
"I left Winterhold for some time, and returned to stay here at the inn."
"I still have research that keeps me busy, and being here in Winterhold ensures I have access to former colleagues."
Try not to?
"But I do realize it's sometimes not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing."
"Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed."
"You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon."
"If the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay your bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive."
"But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties... erased. For a price. Something to think about."
By all I hold sacred... that's a Shout! Like the Graybeards on their mountain!
By the gods! What manner of power is that?
The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!
The Thu'um! She summons the Thu'um!
It is the power of old! The Voice of the Dragonborn!
You were right about this place. And about Mauhulakh.
This was worth coming back for.
Urog is a good learner. I'm glad I have the chance to teach her. Makes me not miss the woods as much.
"Urog and I still hunt a lot, so it's not like I'm cooped up in the longhouse."
I believe the Legate gave you an order. Why are you standing around here flapping your jaw? Move out!
"Why are you still here? You're supposed to be at Korvanjund, proving Galmar right, or proving him wrong."

"Bucket. Knife. Book. Inkpot. Stone. No, no, no."
Knife. Yes. Book. Yes. Bucket. Yes. Inkpot? No.
"General Tullius, over here!"
It's not that simple. Ulfric wants a Skyrim for the Nords. He doesn't trust what he calls outsiders.
"I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind."
"You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous."
"But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them."
"Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search."
There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.
"We have felt the whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found."
"You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you."
"You've seen how we live -- cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name [QUOTE]Gray Quarter[QUOTE] is an insult."
"That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you."
I have responsibilities to attend to. We'll continue this discussion some other time.
"And you'd have me do what, join the College and prance about casting spells all day?"
"We need coin, Ranmir, and you're not bringing home any."
There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me.
Falk said I could count on you.
You have more than earned the right to purchase property and take the next step to becoming a Thane.
Speak to Falk when you have the funds. And thank you.
Falk told me what you did for us at Wolfskull cave. He says you're someone we can trust.
As you may know Talos worship is outlawed in the Empire.
When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except Talos.
"I would like you to take an item of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos."
"Yes, when we buried my husband I wasn't able to make an offering to Talos."
"I was hoping you would to take something of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos."
Thank you. It would mean a lot to me.
That's all right. Return to me if you change your mind though.
No but my husband Torygg would want a proper burial and this is the way Nords are buried in Skyrim.
I'll meet you outside of town.
"Hey, don't you want to make this exchange?"
Please don't leave. You must help me.
Not now.
You're interrupting the performance.
Come back to me if you find anything.
You're making a mistake!
No! I'm losing the binding.
Stop the intruder!
Look along the east coast. The boat will be there.
It would be best if we spoke little until you've completed your task.
The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has.
Give him the Rueful Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.
One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine.
When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form.
The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse.
Clavicus gave him an axe.
Clavicus sent you didn't he?
You can't have the Axe! It's all I have left now!
We should go get the axe.
Let's get the axe and be done with this.
Now that guy was nuts.
"Don't bother, Clavicus won't talk to me."
"Wait a second, there's another option here."
I have a feeling I'm not going to like what happens when we get back to Clavicus.
All this just to kill me Clavicus?
"You're worth putting in the extra effort for, pooch."
I remember that axe.
And I was so close to being rid of you.
I still don't have my Gleda back.
Don't come back until you have the ring.
The temple is still not clean. Get to it.
You can't have the ring back! You made a commitment!
Once you leave the party you can't just come back.
Lets see how tough you are without Sam keeping an eye on you.
"No Sam, no protection. Time to die."
I think Illdi's better than Dean Pantea actually knows. She just gets intimidated when she's in class and can't sing.
I think someone has a crush on Illdi.
Ataf keeps making eyes at me.
You should tell him to mind his own business.
Aia. You're so mean. I don't think he means anything by it.
"Have it your way, then."
Your performance has been excellent lately Aia. You still need training but one day you will make an adequate singer.
"Yes, Dean. Thank you."
A good story is nine parts truth and one part fiction.
Seems like most of these are nine parts fiction.
Can we really just make things up? It doesn't seem right.
"Read carefully. You will see there are ways to stay true to the essence, Illdi."
Even while making parts up.
Let's try a lute piece. Follow along...
"Now, you try it Aia"
"Yes, Dean Inge."
"Very good, Aia. Class, observe her finger movements. Let's try a few more pieces."
This time let's try [QUOTE]The Age of Aggression[QUOTE]. I will demonstrate for the class.
This time let's try [QUOTE]The Age of Oppression[QUOTE]. I will demonstrate for the class.
That's all for today. You're dismissed.
"You see, all you need is a bit of spirit and any song can be made into a classic."
Come in and shut the door.
Welcome to Bits and Pieces. I'm sure you'll find what you need here.
Your path has brought you to the finest fletcher in all the land.
Feel free to look around. We have a fine selection of herbs here at Angela's Aromatics.
Welcome to the Winking Skeever. Take a load off and enjoy the atmosphere.
The Poetic Edda is never truly complete. As a living history of Skyrim we Bards continually add parts to it.
"In fact, If you collected parts of the Edda from any Bard you encountered in your travels I would be willing to pay you for them."
"Wonderful. Just speak to various bards outside of the college, get there parts of the Poetic Edda and return them here to me."
Come back to me if you change your mind.
I do. I've been working on mine for a while now.
I suppose Giraud sent you for it? I was still trying to get the wording right but here it is.
Here you are. Always good to see a fellow bard. Tell Giraud I said hello.
This is part of me. Guard it with your life.
"I've got it right here. Just don't read it, it's not very good."
Wonderful. Soon we'll have the latest section of the Edda complete. Keep up the good work.
That's it! You've collected every last verse. I can't thank you enough. This deserves a special bonus.
Candy! Get your King Olaf's Festival candy!
"Tasty, sugary treats!"
Spiced Wine here. First cup is paid for by the college.
Get some Spiced Wine. A Festival Favorite.
"Meat Pies. Try one for free, come back for more. Get your meat pies."
Can't have a meal without meat. Come and get some here.
I said [QUOTE]a free meat pie[QUOTE]. As in one. Here's yours.
Just one bottle per customer. Except for the man who saved the festival. Here's a couple bottles for you.
You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons.
"I doubt the blessing's effects last for very long, so ask whenever you're heading out, and I'll perform the proper rites."
[QUOTE]May the scales of the dragonkind splinter at the touch of your arrows and crack under the weight of your sword.[QUOTE]
"That's all there is to it, Dragonborn. Good luck."
"The architecture of this temple is marvelous. Have you ever seen stonework like this, Delphine?"
"I'm not a scholar, Esbern. How many times do I have to tell you?"
Nonsense. Is a child who learns to read [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of literature? Is a smith's apprentice [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of blacksmithing?
"Well, I'm [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of architecture. And that's that."
"Do you ever think about them, Esbern? The others?"
"The other Blades? No. Best not to think what the Thalmor do to their victims, my dear."
You're right. Sorry to bring it up.
I've been writing some notes about all the Akaviri designs we've discovered. If only the Imperial Library could see my research.
"Esbern, if the Empire could even acknowledge the Blades existence, we'd all have reason to celebrate."
"Now, now my dear. I'm talking about academia, not politics."
There's a difference?
I've been chronicling the recent history of the Blades. What would you like your entry to say?
[QUOTE]I survived[QUOTE]?
Come now. You did more than just survive all those years. Your evasion of the Thalmor would be useful for future Blades to study.
What? Your heroic tale of locking yourself in the Ratway for years isn't enough?
"Have you ever heard of the expression, [QUOTE]the scale of the Argonian that bit you?[QUOTE]"
"No, I guess not. Well, the principle applies here. It's a potion, made from those dragon parts. Give it a try."
"Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?"
"You need to go inside, little cub."
Speak with Galmar. He'll size you up and see where we can best use your talents.
"If you know any true sons and daughters of Skyrim, tell them to head to Windhelm. Ulfric Stormcloak wants to see them."
Uuuuhhhnnnn... aaarrrghhh....
"Ooohhhh, ahhhrrrghhhh... uuuuggghhh."
"Uhhh... (coughing, wheezing) ... ahhhh..."
Uuuuhhhnnnn... it hurts...
"Aaaahhhhhrrrr.... the pain, somebody, stop... the pain..."
(coughing fit) Uuughhnnn...
"They say that our cause is false and that we are nothing more than thieves, thugs and murderers!"
This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim.
We come to this moment carried by the sacrifices and courage of our fellows. Those who have fallen. And those still bearing the shields to our right.
All right. It's time to deliver the final blow to the Stormcloak rebellion.
"You have all fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring us to this point."
"But no! We are farmers! We are craftsmen! We are sons and daughters of shopkeepers, maid servants and soldiers!"
We are the sons and daughters of Skyrim!
This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him.
"On this day, our enemy will know the fullness of our determination, the true depth of our anger, and the exalted righteousness of our cause."
Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice.
And we have come this far because our cause is true. Because we fight as one. And because our hearts are bursting with anger!
That message is this.
Any king who denies the Emperor will wake one morning to face the Legion staring down his gates.
"And on that day, we will confiscate his city, and restore the rule of law to his lands."
The gods are watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And men under suns yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today.
"Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty."
"What we do here today, we do for our country! For all the true Nords of Skyrim!"
"But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people."
"By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!"
"Fear neither pain, nor darkness. For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in their hands, and courage in their hearts."
"But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating."
The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded.
You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades.
Do you wish to become a Blade?
Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?
"Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed."
I do.
"I am. The Blades of the 2nd Era hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the beasts lived."
"Only you can truly defeat these monsters, Dragonborn, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you."
Just ask whenever you're ready to take on a dragon. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny.
"It's quiet for now, Dragonborn. Perhaps later we'll find where one of those serpents is hiding."
I have. One of the old Akaviri records names a dragon living nearby. Shall we send the Blades to help you?
"Good luck, Dragonborn."
"Let me know when you are, then."
"We're with you, Dragonborn."
It's good to see the Blades fighting alongside the Dragonborn once again. To think we're treading in the footsteps of thousands of years past.
"While you're out hunting, keep a sharp eye open for any dragon scales and bones you might find. I'd be interested in looking at them."
"Good. The dragon's soul should be making you stronger. Come back another time, and we'll track down another one for you."
"Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me."
It is? Well that's different.
He's in the inn. Look around. I'm sure you'll find him.
"He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch him."
"Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough."
I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.
Very good... Let's see what you have here.
Interesting... They know more of our plans than I expected...
It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...
One moment while I [QUOTE]correct[QUOTE] some of these documents... That should do it.
"Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more freely."
Good work! Let's see what you got.
Hmm... They know more of our plans than I thought... Not good...
"Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those..."
"Give me a moment while I make a few, um, [QUOTE]corrections[QUOTE] to these reports... There we go."
Make sure those forged documents get to the Legate in Morthal. They should give them the wrong idea... and us the advantage.
What's your business here in Winterhold?
Should've known.
Not that it matters anymore. No one bothers coming to Winterhold for any other reason.
"Stay clear of that College, if you know what's good for you."
Nothing but foul deeds behind those walls.
It does. The College has caused enough problems; don't need you or anyone else adding to them.
"If you're not here for the College, then you've little other reason to be in Winterhold at all."
Look around you. Winterhold is in this state because of those damned mages.
"They sit up there in their tower, doing gods-know-what, and who watches over them?"
The guards don't even dare go up there unless they've no choice.
"I do, and if you count yourself among their numbers then you've blood on your hands as well."
There's nothing left of Winterhold. Nothing!
"Everyone knows it's the College's fault that the sea swallowed our city. Still they deny it, but we all know the truth."
"Come, we must get to the Skull and destroy it."
"Let's continue, we still have much to do."
"The Torpor should be in a tall bottle with dark liquid. If you find it, bring it to me."
The laboratory adjoins the library. I'm hoping we'll find a sample of the Torpor left undamaged.
"If you'll check the shelves around the balcony, I'll check around the lower level."
This way... the library isn't far.
We mustn't tarry... the Skull needs to be destroyed as soon as possible.
"Once we get inside, all will become clear."
I promise to answer all of your questions. Follow me.
"This way, my daughter."
"This way, my son."
"If you change your mind, I'll be here."
Take your time. I understand your hesitation.
What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.
"Damn you, Mercer!"
"Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!"
"I'm sorry lass, I... I can't..."
"Okay, got another one for you."
"Fine, go ahead."
"Three guards run into a bar, but the fourth one just ducks. Why?"
"Um, I don't know, why?"
Hold and stand down.
"If you want to get into Riften, use the North Gate. This one's closed."
"My orders are to tell the riff-raff to use the North Gate, that's it."
"No. You can use the North Gate, or you can head to the next city."
Keep it. Not worth going to prison over.
That's a quick way to the executioner's block.
That's the North Gate in case you forget.
That's far enough.
"If you want to enter Riften, use the North Gate. Otherwise, we have nothing to talk about."
There's nothing else to discuss. Use the North Gate if you want to enter Riften.
"You can use the North Gate to enter the city, or you can hit the road. Your choice."
It's a long way to the next city if you change your mind.
Well? In you go.
Welcome to Riften.
"You want in, you need to cooperate."
Hold there.
"Before I let you into Riften, you need to pay the visitor's tax."
Have you decided to pay the visitor's tax?
For the privilege of entering the city. What does it matter?
It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Let me open the gate and you can head into the city.
Nope. Not even close.
"All right, keep your voice down... you want everyone to hear you? I'll let you in, just let me unlock the gate."
"Call it what you want. You don't pay, then you're not getting in."
"Don't want in, huh? Fine. Have a good walk to the next city."
The gate's unlocked. You can head inside when you're ready.
Look how you sniffed out my little scheme at the North Gate. You knew it was a shakedown and you called him on it. That's what I'm talking about.
"Aye, that he was. And you sniffed him out because he broke one of the cardinal rules of our business... he got greedy."
"He was told to run the scam on merchants, but he smelled the gold on you and his judgment went out the window."
Killing him was a bit... impulsive.
"A true professional would have kept his cool and dealt with it a different way, but I'll let it go."
"Actually, I admire how you handled the situation."
You kept your cool and you didn't kill him. That's the mark of a professional thief.
"Those sycophants in the Temple would call her Kynareth. Just a pale shadow of the truth, like all the Temple Divines."
"Kyne! Blessed Warrior-Wife. Shor's widow, sacred to any true Nord hunter. She's the mother of men and beasts, and her veil is the storm."
"I'm a Blade, now. I can hardly believe it."
"By my honor, I pledge to rid Tamriel of dragons."
Dragonborn. What do you need?
Something's wrong... Boss' been down there too long.
Yeah... Let's wait a little longer. Then...
Good luck.
"If you want to get paid, keep your weapon sheathed."
No one dies. Remember that. We're not assassins.
"If you get arrested, it's on your head."
Keep to the shadows and you'll do fine.
I don't want a trail of dead bodies leading here. Keep it clean.
Get the job done and get back alive. That's all there is to it.
Don't give up now... there's plenty of loot out there just ripe for the taking.
"Hey, I still have plenty of work to do here."
Walking away without taking a job is like passing a bloated coinpurse on a table.
You think you're finished? I've got plenty more where that came from.
"Come on, take another job so we can both make some money."
These jobs aren't going to finish themselves you know.
"Hey, where do you think you're going? We have work to do."
Don't muck this up.
Don't forget your represntin' the Guild. Don't do anythin' stupid.
Make us proud.
"Be careful out there... wouldn't want to lose such a promisin' cutpurse now, would we."
"Use your skills, not your blade and you'll do fine."
No killin' or no pay. Remember that.
"Remember, keep it clean. We don't want blood on our hands."
Can I give you a little tip? Take every job you can get or else you'll end up a beggar.
"Hey, this guild needs the coin... walkin' away without takin' work is not going to make you popular around here."
There's plenty more work for the likes of you.
"What's the matter, afraid of getting your hands dirty?"
Where you off to? There's work to be done.
Only way this guilds going to continue to grow is by takin' extra work.
Find me if you're ever lookin' for some extra coin.
Finally. Now I can get back to work.
"Don't hurry back, I won't be waiting."
Good luck on your next job.
"Off for some wine, eh? Drink one for me."
Keep to the shadows.
Be seeing you.
Always a pleasure...
Go and pick some fights.
"Some other time, perhaps."
I'm sure we'll speak again.
I hope we bump into each other again.
Maybe I'll see you around the Guild.
"If you ever need more practice with the bow, just grab me."
Come find me if you need more marksman training.
"Need any more pickpocket training, you just let me know."
Come back and see me if you ever need pickpocket training.
"Until next we meet, lad."
"Until next we meet, lass."
A word of advice. Don't disappoint me.
I'm watching you.
It was on a job a few years back... it was supposed to be a simple burglary on a house in Windhelm.
"I was working with Vex and we got inside with no trouble. We found the loot, and made our way out."
"Well it was, up until the point where we set foot outside. The house was surrounded by town guard... the client had ratted us out."
"Vex just tells me to run, so I did. Half of them went after me, the other half went after her."
"Are you kidding me? Vex lost them in seconds... once she steps into the shadows, she vanishes."
Me? I ran... and I ran... straight through the gates of Windhelm and all the way back to Riften.
Vex was waiting for me at the Flagon when I came in... drenched in sweat. Everyone just took a look at me and laughed.
"Well, I had forgotten we had our horses tied up just outside of Windhelm... Vex rode hers back and arrived hours before I did."
"So, that's how I earned the name. Now keep it to yourself."
I used to live in Valenwood working at my father's winery... we made the finest wine to ever cross your lips I promise you.
"We were doing well, plenty of coin, a huge mansion and I was even betrothed to a lovely young woman."
"Because it was dull. Every day was the same boring routine; working at the winery, social visits with friends, parties with no one I cared about."
I just wanted a little excitement. Something dangerous.
I hooked up with a guild in Valenwood... I think they called themselves the Silver Crescents. Spent quite a few years doing jobs for them.
"Made a lot of coin, but I didn't care. I didn't really need it... I was running with them because it fit, made me feel alive."
"Well, after a while my father caught on to what I was doing. He confronted me one night and gave me a choice."
"Either leave Valenwood, or he'd have me thrown into jail. Gave me a day to say my goodbyes to everyone."
I ended up in Skyrim thanks to a contact I'd made when I was with the Crescents... good old Delvin.
"He introduced me to Gallus, and that was it. I've been here ever since."
"And you know what? Despite what I left behind, I don't regret it one bit."
"Look, I don't really know you. I don't even really know anyone here."
Why do you care anyway? It's not like we're family. This is a business.
"Look, you want to know about me? All right, I'll tell you."
"I'll tell you about the time I was a young girl, barely out of her teens... living on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere."
Didn't have a coin to spend between our entire family. Ate the same slop we fed our livestock.
"Oh, wait... it gets much better."
"How about the fact that our farm was attacked by bandits, and that they killed my entire family who didn't even brandish a weapon against them."
"Here's the best part. They took me as a prize, and violated me for a fortnight. Tossed me from bandit to bandit like... like..."
It's fine... I had to tell someone I suppose.
Carrying around a weight like that... it hurts after a while. Cuts you inside like a dagger to the heart.
"Over time, I managed to gain their confidence. Then one night I grabbed a knife, waited until they fell asleep and cut their throats."
I never returned to that pig farm you know. There's nothing for me there.
So that's my sad story. What do you think?
"Maybe one day, just not today."
"Pull up a chair, my friend... this is quite a tale."
"When I started out in this business, I wasn't really interested in the Guild or being a thief."
I didn't mean to imply I was earning an honest living either.
"With my lock picking aptitude, I was a natural at jailbreaking... made a great deal of gold doing it too."
"It's where a client pays you to get arrested, and you get thrown into a prison for the express purpose of breaking out."
"Usually it's to free someone the client cares about... and sometimes to... well, to kill someone on their behalf."
"Either way, the trick was in the escape, and that's where my strengths came in handy."
"Well, as a jailbreaker, you work alone. No Guild to back you up."
"I'd do jobs for the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, but if things didn't go as planned, I was on my own."
The last jailbreak I attempted failed. I was imprisoned in High Rock for three years before they let me go.
After that I promised myself I'd never do it again.
"I don't know. I think I realized that out in the world, my skills would bring me more wealth as a thief rather than an assassin."
Killing someone in a jail is much easier than what the Dark Brotherhood deals with. I guess I wanted to play it safe.
"I already knew Delvin, I asked if I could join up, and that was that."
I joined up with them maybe ten years ago.
"Small clan... maybe twenty men. We'd raid villages, rob caravans... but it was always about the killing for them."
Don't get me wrong. The first few years with that clan were some of the best years of my life.
"All the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink and all the women I could bed."
We raided a caravan one spring... I think it was a few wagons with some farmers moving to a new village.
They didn't put up much of a fight. All that was left were the women and the children.
Then the leader of our clan... Garthek... he ordered us to kill the rest.
"No, we usually let them go. I refused to do it, and Garthek ordered the clan to kill me as well."
"Luckily, I had made some friends with the clan who immediately sided with me."
"We tore each other to pieces. After it was over, those of us that remained simply went our separate ways."
I left his head on a pike at the wreckage of the caravan.
Never knew what became of the rest of the clan that survived. I suppose they moved on just like I did.
My father told me he found me as a young boy in the wreckage of a ship that sank off of the coast near Solitude.
All he found in my pocket was a tiny smooth stone inscribed with some sort of strange runes.
No one does. I've even taken the damn thing to the College of Winterhold.
I must have spent every last coin I've made with the Guild trying to find out what it means.
Perhaps. They could be nonsense... inane scribbles done by someone in idle boredom.
"But if not... if they actually mean something, they might tell me where I'm from... what ship was I on. Everything."
"Actually, the fisherman who found me, the man I call my father gave it to me."
"Thought it was fitting I suppose. I never changed it, because it never felt right to do so."
Ah! Here it is.
I appreciate that.
It's kind of an amusing tale.
"I was making my way down the road from Ivarstead towards Riften, and I saw Vex fighting off a couple of wolves."
"Well, there were eight of them and she'd already killed three by the time I joined the fight."
"Together, we made short work of them and the last one limped away licking its wounds."
"Actually, that's when she politely asked me to hand over my coin purse. Can you imagine?"
"We scuffled for a while, broke each other's weapons, and finally fell to the ground exhausted."
Indeed.
"After a few minutes, she looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I wanted to join the Guild. Just like that, no apologies."
Something told me I wouldn't regret it. I had heard the Guild was back on its feet again and most of Skyrim under its belt.
"I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to cross blades with Vex again, but I certainly wouldn't mind a bit of a scuffle..."
Morrowind of course. Any Dunmer worth their weight in ash would tell you the same.
I used to be a member of the Morang Tong.
We were an assassins guild that was sanctioned by the Empire to provide public as well as private executions.
"We did this in the name of Mephala, whom I used to quite fervently worship."
"No. In fact, the Tong were quite the bitter rivals with the Dark Brotherhood."
"Where they operate within the shadows, we operated on the side of justice."
"I didn't have a choice. When the Red Mountain erupted in Morrowind, the Tong fled... spread to the nine winds."
"We made a pact that one day, we might reunite... but I believe that day is long in coming."
Have you taken leave of your senses?
"If the Dark Brotherhood discovered I had been a Morang Tong, they would come after me with a vengeance."
Better to stay out of sight and ply my trade with the Thieves Guild than risk a contract on my head.
I should hope so. The Dark Brotherhood is also known to place contracts on those who associate with the Morang Tong as well.
"So, unless you wish a visit from one of their own, I'd suggest you follow your own advice and keep your mouth shut."
I knew this day would eventually come.
"At least poor Sinderion died doing what he loved, his field research. I told the old fool he should take it easy, but he was too stubborn."
"Perhaps someday I'll continue where he left off, it's the least I can do considering how much he did for me."
"Crimson Nirnroot? I'd heard such a strain existed, but never imagined I'd see any in my lifetime."
Where did you find this?
Blackreach... why does that sound so familiar?
"Of course! It's where my mentor, Sinderion said he was going to do his field research."
"It's been... years I think, but perhaps you could still find him."
You've gathered quite a few of them I see.
I'll search through Sinderion's notes and find some more information about the Crimson Nirnroot and its properties.
Thank you.
You've done alchemy a great service by helping to complete Sinderion's work.
I'd like to give you this tome...it's one of Sinderion's greatest works. I believe you've more than earned it.
Where did all these pretty red plants come from?
Remember Uncle Sinderion? These are the plants he was searching for... the Crimson Nirnroot.
They're beautiful. I can see why he wanted to find them.
"One day, these beautiful plants will make us famous and we can finally move off of this farm... thanks to Sinderion."
I used to be. There isn't much time for that in my life anymore I'm afraid.
"I actually owned a shop in Vivec City long ago, but I had to leave all that behind when the Red Mountain erupted."
Perhaps someday I'll reopen a shop here in Skyrim.
Yes. He was an absolute genius when it came to the nirnroot.
"Sinderion made it his life's work, developing all sorts of interesting concoctions."
"When I was very young, I was sent to Skingrad in Cyrodiil to study with him."
He was a strange Altmer... paid more attention to his research than his own well-being. He lived in the basement of an inn for goodness sakes!
"Well, after I fled Morrowind during the eruption, I made my way here... my family had purchased this farm and its all we had left."
"Years later, Sinderion simply showed up at our doorstep asking to stay for a while... said he was going to do field research."
He stayed with us for decades... became an uncle of sorts to Aduri.
"One day he simply ran out to me in the field, excited that he'd made some sort of a breakthrough and he was going to head out on another trip."
"He never returned. From the journal you discovered, I'm sure you know the rest."
Gauldur!
Bormah!
"Ah, I think that'll do just the trick."
You'll need a little more coin than what you're floatin' around with.
"One block lifts the other. Septimus will give what you want, but you must bring him something in return."
"Oh, a brutish one. Septimus has no fear of you. But as one block raises another, perhaps ourselves could help us each."
You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest knowings.
"Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child compared to the dullest of the Dwemer."
Lucky then they left behind their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls.
In the depths of Blackreach one yet lies.
"Have you heard of Blackreach? [QUOTE]Cast upon where Dwemer cities slept, the yearning spire hidden learnings kept.[QUOTE]"
The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for hearings?
"To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus."
"The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm."
"Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more."
"Give it, quickly."
Extraordinary. I see it now.
The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals.
"Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it."
"A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them."
"The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key."
Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.
Not now.
This isn't a good time.
The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.
That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean.
He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.
"No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about."
"We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood."
"Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death."
You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.
Is that? Did you repair the blade?
"Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas."
And you avenged him.
"You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it."
There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel.
"We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years."
Kodlak did not care for vengeance.
And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim.
"Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be."
The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.
"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here."
"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Sister here."
[QUOTE]The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.[QUOTE]
The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more.
"The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak."
"As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle."
"I can't go any further, Shield-Brother."
"I can't go any further, Shield-Sister."
"Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for me."
"Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine."
"I'm not proud, but I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor."
Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?
I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all.
You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.
And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger.
Let's go tell the others.
You're back.
Thank you. I'll be here.
I appreciate it.
Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.
"I think her mother, Tova, has the key."
"Her mother would have had the key, but she... that family is cursed, I tell you."
I don't want to be responsible for sending you to your death. Be careful in the mine.
Don't kid yourself... stone runs in our blood.
May the road favor the foolish...
Darkwater Crossing is a difficult journey. Mind yourself.
"Keep yourself safe, traveler."
Fortune to you and your children.
Redbelly Mine gets its name from the red mist filling the place.
You get used to it after a while... kind of smells like the hot springs out in the tundra.
No idea what's causing it though.
Mining iron takes a lot of strength and special reinforced tools.
I must have broken five or six pickaxes in the last few months alone.
"But now that I've got Rocksplinter here, I can cut through stone like a hot knife through butter."
"I might be a woman, but I can crack rock with the best of them."
"Be careful in there, you can take a nasty spill."
Damn place is filled with this reddish mist. Can't see more than ten feet in front of your face.
"But when you can sniff out a vein of iron like me, it isn't too much trouble."
"It's full of spiders, that's what's wrong with it! Almost killed Grogmar and me when they showed up."
I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble.
Go! We'll follow when we can!
Get back!
"Gone? Every one of them? Why, that's incredible."
"Finally, we can reopen the mine and put Shor's Stone back on the map!"
"Here, please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude."
Moved right in and made themselves at home. Did it overnight. I'm not even sure exactly where they came from.
"No one's been hurt yet, and they seem to be staying in the mine, but who knows how long that will last?"
"If we can't get back into the mine, our town is sunk."
One day we were cracking rocks in the deepest parts of the mine and the next day they were all over the place.
I'd give my eye teeth if it meant getting those damn spiders out of the mine!
"Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up."
I never asked you to help in the first place. Why would I? Everyone in Skyrim only helps themselves.
Wait... you mean you killed every last one of them? I can't believe it!
They're as useless as a fifth wheel on a wagon. Gave me some sort of a line about [QUOTE]keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.[QUOTE]
What's the point in protecting this place if the mine's completely useless? Idiots.
"My parents live there. I usually make the journey to bring them gifts and to just say hello, but I haven't been well lately."
I've written some letters and placed them in a satchel. Perhaps you wouldn't mind delivering it to them on my behalf?
"It's a shame our daughter couldn't make the journey herself, but at least she still thinks of us."
"If you wouldn't mind bringing this back to her for us, I'd appreciate it."
"You would? Well then, I would insist on rewarding you for your time."
"Here, take my satchel and give it to my father, Verner. He'll likely have something for you to bring back."
"Yes, indeed."
I had a bad fall in the mine when I was bringing some food to the men.
"I was pretty bad off for a while, but a priest of Mara was passing through on his way to Dawnstar and healed me to the best of his abilities."
I'm still pretty sore and can't really walk too far without having to rest for a while.
"Ah, yes... seems he sent back my satchel stuffed with letters. I look forward  to reading them."
"I appreciate the delivery, here... I want you to have this. I insist."
"Just pay them, Bersi!"
Oh my word!
This isn't happening!
You were right Galmar.
Again?
I'm in no mood to joke.
"Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours."
Whiterun is only a means to an end.
"I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric..."
Whenever you are.
Is any man ever ready to give the order that will mean the deaths of many.
No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must.
"But you are that man, Ulfric.  You've been that man before, and you'll be him again."
And these men and women - they call themselves Stormcloaks because they believe in you...
"They're the meanest, toughest sons of bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this."
They want this as much as you do. Perhaps they want it more.
You're certain we're ready?
"Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered with Legionnares. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they still stand."
We're ready.
"And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls down with my bare feet! - if you would only ask me to do it!"
"And I'm sure you could do it, too."
Alright.
This is it.
Yes!
Send the word. [QUOTE]A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun.[QUOTE]
"Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords flashing."
So it begins.
Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the front lines.
I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that battlefield. I need you there.
"Fight well, or die well. Talos be with you!"
Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in.
Talos be with you!
"I think it's time we make this Guild Master thing official. Go and talk to Brynjolf, he's makin' preparations."
I heard Brynjolf is looking for you. I think it's time for the Guild to have a new leader.
"So, they're making you leader, huh? Better go find Brynjolf so he can seal the deal."
"I heard Brynjolf wants to see you about being Guild Master. I suppose my turn will come one day, but for now you'll do nicely."
"So, they're making you Guild Master, eh? Good. Just find Brynjolf and he can make it official."
Brynjolf's been looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
"Brynjolf tells me you'll make an excellent Guild Master. Oh, he's looking for you, by the way."
What are you doing talking to me? Didn't you know Brynjolf's been trying to find you? It's time to install you as Guild Master!
Brynjolf's looking for you. Something about becoming the Guild Master.
"So, you're finally going to make Guild Master, eh? Well, you better track down Brynjolf to seal the deal."
"Guild Master, huh? Well, guess we could do worse. Better go see Brynjolf about it."
Brynjolf told me he was looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
Did you know Brynjolf was looking for you? I think it's about the Guild Master ceremony.
Brynjolf's been looking for you. He wants to discuss the Guild Master ceremony. Congratulations... boss.
"Well, my friend... the time's come to make it official. It's time to become our Guild Master."
"Don't worry, I promise this will be short and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room, we can begin."
"I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer, anyway."
I'm not getting any younger. Let's get this ceremony done with.
"So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!"
"Not now, it's time for the ceremony."
"You need anything, anything at all... don't hesitate to ask."
We can talk after the Guild Master ceremony.
I am at your service.
"Don't talk to me, you're supposed to be at the ceremony!"
We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!
We'll chat after the ceremony.
I promise to live up to your expectations.
Shouldn't the ceremony be completed first?
Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.
We can get better acquainted once the ceremony's ended.
"Congratulations, boss!"
We can speak after the ceremony's done.
"I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale."
"After Brynjolf has installed you as Guild Master, we can speak at length."
I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.
"Not now, you idiot. We'll talk after this ridiculous ceremony."
"Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck."
"Wait until the ceremony is over, then we'll talk."
"As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you."
"Hang on. When the ceremony's done, we'll talk."
"So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!"
Not yet... wait until Brynjolf's finished the ceremony.
I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.
I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.
We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.
We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.
Here's to a long and prosperous future... may the Guild last another hundred years.
What are you doing? You're supposed to be attending the ceremony.
"Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short."
"Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order."
"With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours."
Delvin?
Agreed.
Vex?
"Sure, why not."
Karliah?
Absolutely.
"Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life."
Now everyone get back to work.
Aduri is what some would call a free spirit. She likes to wander the fall forest for hours on end.
"If we were still living at my alchemy shop in Vivec City, it wouldn't be so bad, she could wander the canals all day."
"But around here, there's a tremendous amount of work to get done, not to mention the dangers she's not ready to face."
"I don't need luck, I need rest."
"Fantastic. I was concerned I had asked for too many, but I'm glad to see you proved me wrong."
Let me at least give you something for your efforts... finding all of these couldn't have been easy... or cheap.
"My goodness, how did you ever come by all of these?"
"No matter, I appreciate your generosity."
Come visit again sometime.
"Good luck finding those jazbay grapes, they're very rare."
Back to work.
"A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had."
"If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can."
That's it! You found it!
I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies.
I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind.
It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me.
Thanks. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.
Fine. I'll wait until someone else with a little more courage comes along.
That's it! That's my bow!
"I don't know how you got it back, and I don't want to know. Frankly, I don't even care... I'm just so glad to see it again."
"Here, this is all can afford to give you as compensation. Hope it's enough."
"Dragons, thieves and war. I should have stayed in Morrowind."
"The Ratway is somewhere under Riften, shouldn't be too tough to find."
Watch yourself out there or they'll take everything away from you.
Are you kidding me? We're all alone out here except for a few guards who couldn't give a damn about us.
We make easy pickings for thieves looking to steal everything we worked so hard for.
"Not only did I they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people."
He said he was going east towards the border of Morrowind to trade some of our grain to some folks at Broken Helm Hollow.
"I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say."
"If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind."
"No, it can't be... oh my... and all this time, I was thinking he'd been unfaithful to me. I feel so stupid."
"I've been a fool, wasting my time sitting here helpless when I could have sent help sooner. Perhaps this is all my doing..."
"What's done is done. Here, I want you to have this. Bringing me closure was kind of you."
"Good. If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to Oblivion... he's not welcome here any more."
"No, it can't be... oh my... and all this time, I was thinking he'd been unfaithful to me. I feel so stupid."
Doesn't matter. I'm sure he's long gone by now anyway.
"Well, he said that a few men have been going by to some of the local farms promising a good price from all the local mills and farms."
Leifnarr said they'd pay double what you can usually get at the markets.
"The catch was, he had to head out there with our wood. So not only is Leifnarr gone, but a good bit of our supplies as well."
"Bye, mister."
"Bye, lady."
Drop by and see us again if you're ever in the area.
Remember to tell that bastard I never want to see his ugly face again!
"Quit taking advantage of us and this world might be a better place, you got that?"
"Don't let the men take advantage of you, always be on your guard."
"With just myself and one child, it's damn near impossible."
"With Leifnarr gone, it's really put me in a terrible bind. I'm having trouble making ends meet."
"At this rate, we won't last more than a few more seasons at best. Then I'll just have to sell the old place."
We've got an old saying -- the Gray-Manes have lived in Whiterun since the first snows fell in Skyrim.
"Well, maybe that's not entirely true, but our clan's got a long an' proud history in this hold."
"We respect the old ways, the Nord ways, an' a Gray-Mane has worked the Skyforge since before the time of my grandfather's father."
"Aye, they're an old clan like ours, but they cast their lot with the Empire when the uprising began."
"Olfrid Battle-Born made his money from farming, an' got himself some new friends among the Empire's nobles."
"Now he's in the Emperor's pocket like the rest of 'em, with no regard for honor an' tradition."
"Aye, we used to be fast friends, though it was long ago."
"We were two of the city's oldest an' most-respected clans, an' we could trace our histories all the way back to Ysgramor's companions."
"But then Olfrid got rich an' decided he an his kin were too good for us simple, backwards Nord folk."
"When the troubles began, he took the Empire's side. We haven't spoken much since then."
"Well, first an' foremost there's repairs to make an' wounds to heal. Folks are depending on us getting the city back in working order."
"Once things settle down, I'll be lookin' to recruit more guards for the city, then shore up our stores of food an' water."
"The Empire might try an take the city back, or worse, we'll get a visit from a dragon. We've got to be ready for both."
"Aye, with a certainty."
It was Talos that helped us win back the city. I'm as sure of that as the sun rising in the morning.
Might even build a new temple and put Heimskr in charge of it. Hah! I bet he'd like that.
"I won't say it again, Vignar - Talos worship is forbidden. It's the Empire's law, and we're still a part of the Empire."
"A law made at the tip of an Aldmeri sword, aye. A sword stained red with Nord blood."
Is this what our people fought and died for? To forsake our most beloved ancestor and divine?
"I'm no happier about this than you are, but I don't want the see the Thalmor rounding up people in the streets and throwing them in prison."
"Do your loyalties lie with the Thalmor, then?"
"I warn you, Gray-Mane, you are treading on dangerous ground."
"Don't threaten me, boy. You're either a Nord who respects our traditions, or you're not."
"If not, it isn't me you'll have to answer to, but the people of this city and this hold."
"Someone's been pilfering crops from my farm. If I find out it's one of your kin, I'll see the culprit rot in prison."
"I'm surprised you had the wits to notice, Olfrid, what with your nose buried so far up the Emperor's backside."
You won't be laughing when the Thalmor come to root out Stormcloak sympathizers.
I've already put in a claim to the land and property you'll forfeit when you're found to be a collaborator.
"I'll remember that when the Stormcloaks liberate the city. No amount of money will protect you then, Battle-Born."
"I've heard you Gray-Manes are collaborating with the Stormcloaks. If I see any such treachery, I'll deal with you myself."
"Bold words, Battle-Born. While you're meting out justice to traitors, are you going to deal with the Emperor, as well?"
"What? Speak your meaning plainly, old man."
How many Nords died to save the Empire? And what was our reward?
"The worship of Talos outlawed, and now the Thalmor come to conduct their witch-hunts while the Empire stands idly by."
"Don't lecture me about treachery, whelp. You don't know the meaning of the word."
"Well, it could be worse. The former steward, Proventus, kept very detailed records."
"But yes, it's been a lot of work. Vignar doesn't want the change to disrupt the lives of his people. They've got enough to deal with already."
And we've done as much as we can to prepare for that.
"But remember, Whiterun is home to the Companions. Any dragon that comes here will get more than he's bargained for, I think."
It's as rewarding as it is dangerous. Let's see what I can show you.
I think I can teach you a thing or two.
I think I can teach you a thing or two.
I can certainly share a bit of what I know.
I can certainly share a bit of what I know.
"You wish to learn from the best, eh? So be it."
I can. It might save your life.
I can. It might save your life.
You deal with powerful forces. Take care they do not overwhelm you.
"I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful."
"I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful."
"I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge."
"I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge."
Mind what - or who - you practice this on.
You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.
You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.
I'll show you what I can about protecting yourself.
"Use it right, and you won't feel a thing."
I shall explain to you the mysteries of the outer realms.
"Your power over others shall be great, like mine."
"I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet."
"I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet."
"You'll be able to run circles around the big, slow brutes in Heavy Armor."
"All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me."
"All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me."
I'll show you what I know.
I'll show you what I know.
I'll show you what I know.
"You'll never compare to me, but I can try and teach you anyway."
I can teach you a few things.
I can teach you a few things.
"Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you."
"Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you."
I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.
You wish to do what I do? Very well.
It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.
"Stick with me, and they'll never even know you're there."
"I can show you a few things, but anyone asks, and my name never comes up. Understand?"
They'll never see you coming.
"Well, you've come to the right place."
"Well, you've come to the right place."
"Well, you've come to the right place."
"Well, you've come to the right place."
It's all in the swing. Let me show you.
It's all in the swing. Let me show you.
"The Thalmor hunted us down, remember? It wasn't exactly great for recruitment."
But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the Blades. Someday.
"If you find anyone you think would make a good recruit, I can certainly take a look at them."
"Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in."
Thanks.
Are you sure? I'll need to ask them to take an oath to leave their old life behind and stay here from now on.
You want this one to become a Blade? You're sure?
Very well. I'll do the oath later. Let's just get 'em geared up and ready to fight.
Very well. He seems like a fighter to me. I'll give him the oath.
Very well. She seems like a fighter to me. I'll give her the oath.
Right then.
If you find any more candidates bring them here.
"I can handle training one more. After that, I think we'll be ready for a little dragon hunting of our own."
That's enough recruits for now. Ask Esbern about the dragon lairs he's been studying. We'll have the recruits do some hunting with you.
You've already taken care of it?  Thank you friend.
Could it really be?  Wow this is what I've been looking for.
"Can I have it?  It's worthless to you, but I can pay."
"Thank you so much, this scroll means a lot to my family. Take this for your trouble."
"I'm sorry, I've come too far to lose it now."
Insolent bard. Die!
"Arise, Olaf! My vengeance is at hand!"
Olaf!
"It's good to see you in one piece, lad!"
"It's good to see you in one piece, lass!"
I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done.
The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future.
What's become of the Skeleton Key?
That's it then. After all of those years of helplessly watching the Guild decline.
"But enough of that... I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend."
"I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing... and no one skims!"
"If you still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more than their fair share to give out."
"Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!"
Glory to the Forsworn!
The Reach will be ours again.
"Ah, my friend from Cidhna Mine. Hello."
This is where it will begin. A new uprising.
We'll have our freedom. One day.
The Silver-Bloods pay their debts. You have my thanks.
"Madanach has been found to be the true murderer of Markarth. On behalf the city, I apologize for your wrongful imprisonment."
"By killing Madanach you've freed Markarth from his hidden tyranny. On behalf of the city, I thank you."
Damn those Forsworn. Think they can kill people in my city? I'll have Madanach's head!
My brother tells me you've done us a service. Thank you.
"You. You aren't with the Forsworn, are you? People say they saw you when the prisoners escaped. So many dead."
"I heard about you being pardoned. What were the guards thinking, taking you in?"
Huh. Heard you broke out of Cidhna Mine with those Forsworn. Do you have any idea how many died?
Can't believe anyone was dumb enough to mistake you for a Forsworn agent.
Can't believe Madanach is on the loose again. I hope those rumors I'm hearing about your part in that are wrong.
Everyone's been talking about you. The guards will have to answer for throwing an innocent person in Cidhna Mine.
Forsworn rampaging through the streets. As if business wasn't slow enough.
"Oh, it's you! Sorry to hear about your imprisonment. I'm sure the guards didn't mean to throw you in jail"
"I saw you. With the Forsworn. By the old gods, that was something."
I'll be damned. Someone who actually escaped Cidhna Mine. You're the talk of the Warrens.
You escaped Cidhna Mine? With Madanach? Everyone in the Warrens has been praising your name.
What was it like? Cidhna Mine? We've all been talking about your escape. And being pardoned after. Amazing.
I'm not certain what use it would be.
The Staff is said to be able to absorb great amounts of energy. Perhaps it can interact with the Eye in a way that nothing else can.
"I don't know, not for sure."
"But perhaps the staff can absorb some of the energy coming out of the Eye, weaken it. Allow us to get close to Ancano."
"I don't know. If the Augur suggested it, there must be a good reason for locating it."
"I'm afraid I don't see the connection, though."
"No more than anyone else, I don't think."
They're a very old order. Pre-dated the Imperial Mages Guild by quite a bit.
"In fact, the Mages Guild was founded in opposition to the idea of the Psijic Order, that only an elite few should have control over magic."
"No one has seen or heard from them in over a hundred years now, though."
"I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course."
"The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since."
"And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing!"
"If nothing else, I'd take it as a compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel worthy."
"Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage when I was but an Apprentice here."
"But that was a great many years ago, before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely."
"Ah, that. Yes, the group prior to yours has disappeared entirely."
It's possible that there was less than the necessary amount of oversight. That's still being looked into.
But we've had no contact with them for quite some time now.
"Arniel wondered if perhaps they'd somehow managed to get themselves lost in the Outer Realms, but I think that's giving them too much credit."
I'm not sure. None of them were working on anything terribly dangerous.
I hadn't really considered it in terms of time. I suppose it's been at least a month.
Let me think... what were they working on?
"As I recall, Yisra was trying to improve flame cloak spells to better work in Skyrim's harsh environment."
"Ilas-tei was practicing Illusions spells. She was having trouble with the calm spells, I believe, but only ever worked with skeevers."
"And then there's Borvir and Rundi. Twins, though they rarely agreed on anything."
Those two boys were obsessed with mead. Convinced they could concoct something to compete with Honningbrew.
"Something about using frost magic to chill the mead for a certain period of time. I felt it was a waste, but the Arch-Mage let them proceed."
"None. It's been long enough that honestly, I don't expect to hear from them."
"No, and after what you've discovered I fear the worst for them."
"Yes, I recognize it."
"Well, I suppose I needn't wonder where he is anymore."
"It certainly is. Was, I suppose."
He would never have willingly parted with it. What a shame.
Oh dear.
"I had particularly high hopes for her. Once she'd overcome her difficulties, she could have been quite successful here."
"Gods, this is hers, isn't it?"
She will certainly be missed.
"Well, all of the previous Apprentices have been accounted for, thanks to you."
"Here, why don't you take this. It was intended to be given to the best in their group as a reward for their hard work."
It's the least I can do for your help in putting this matter to rest.
"Oh dear, I didn't mean to say it like that. That wasn't a joke, really."
My problem with her? She's the one who has a problem with me!
"She's threatened by me! By my skill as a wizard, by my elegance and posture, by my superior good looks!"
"But she's not going to get the better of me, oh no. I won't let it get to me one bit. That's what she's after."
"She's trying to undermine my confidence, make me doubt myself. Well it won't work, I tell you!"
"The Arcanaeum is located above the hall, and the Arch-Mage's quarters above that."
"Out of the way, meat."
"Actually, I'm growing it if you hadn't noticed."
I'm the only person alive that can cultivate nirnroot from a seed to a fully grown plant.
I had quite the mentor. He taught me everything he know about the nirnroot and its strange properties.
I haven't seen him in many years. I wonder what became of him...
Is it that obvious? Sigh. I've got my hands full here.
"Between the farm chores, cultivating my supply of nirnroot and keeping a tight rein on my sister Aduri, there's little time for rest."
Really? That would be a pleasant change.
One of the ingredients I need to cultivate nirnroot are jazbay grapes... the acidic content of the juice is perfect for the soil.
I need twenty of them for my current crop.
"His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together."
"Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you."
"There's another piece, that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers and bring it back for me?"
I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through his things.
"Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we?"
Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart.
I regret nothing of what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind fogged or my heart grieved.
It sounds like Eastmarch is too busy with their war to keep their own prisoners in line.
The braggarts in the Reach always claim that no prisoner escapes their mine.
What you don't hear about are the ones who break off from escorts on the way to Markarth.
Haafingar seems to have trouble keeping their prisoners in line.
I'm sorry to have to send you to Hjaalmarch. I can't stand the smell of it myself.
But it seems their criminals can't either and just want to get out.
It seems that law-breakers in the Pale have no desire to stay there. I don't blame them.
The idiots in Falkreath still think the best place for prisoners is that hole in the ground.
"No surprise, but one of them's gotten out. Again."
The so-called prison in Riften leaks like one of their fishnets. This is what happens when you let thieves run your town.
The prisoners just walk right out.
"One of the guards from Dragonsreach came to me, worried about a prisoner who's escaped."
"The Jarl has too much on his mind right now, we won't be troubling him with this."
The snowberries up in Winterhold have lowered themselves to ask for our help.
For some reason they just throw their lawbreakers out into the sea and think that ends the problem.
"But every now and then, one swims back."
"One of them's escaped, and you're going to find that coward."
At this point they don't care what happens to him and neither do I. Best to just kill him and be done with it.
At this point they don't care what happens to her and neither do I. Best to just kill her and be done with it.
Be careful. This man is known to be dangerous.
Be careful. This woman is known to be dangerous.
"We choose our battles, and you've chosen yours. Someone else can take care of it."
"Bit by bit, we bring honor to this land. And you've brought honor to the Companions. More importantly, some gold."
"Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks."
We have a bit of a sensitive matter this time.
A wealthy family has... misplaced one of their heirlooms.
Just in time. I was worried I'd have to do this myself.
Some rich folk had a trinket stolen and they want us to get it back.
I tell you this province is losing its grip. The bandits become more brazen every day.
"Some don't even believe they exist, but the Falmer can be devious. Tunneling into homes, stealing off with valuables."
Those hill people who call themselves [QUOTE]the Forsworn[QUOTE] show no mercy.
"Giants don't usually cause problems like this, but these ones are stirred up for some reason."
"The rumors say the culprits are vampires. I try not to listen to swaggle like that, but figured you should know."
"Of course, it's a group of wizards they're pointing their fingers at. Who knows what they want it for, but we want it back."
"Good, good. These aren't the most glorious jobs, but they pay well."
Move quickly so we can have this over and done with.
We're trusting you on this one. Bring honor to the Companions.
Can't say I blame you. I'll find someone to take care of it.
"Not the response I was hoping for, but suit yourself."
"Give it here. They've asked for the utmost discretion on this matter, so I'll make sure it gets to them."
Here's your share of their reward.
"And it looks undamaged. They'll be pleased, I'm sure. And we're pleased with their money."
Nice work with this one. You make us all proud.
"Harbinger, I'd be honored if you joined me in my search."
I had once heard Skjor and Kodlak talking about the Totems of Hircine.
Simple-looking objects that could channel the powers of the werewolf in new directions.
"Once Kodlak began looking for his cure, I'd wager Skjor didn't bring it up again."
But I was going through his things and found a book I had never seen before. All about the Totems.
"I've been talking to my sources around the holds, and think I may have heard where one of them lives."
"I think I've located another one of the Totems. Come with me, and we'll write ourselves into their history."
"I've finally tracked down the last of the Totems, I think."
"The information wasn't easy to come by, but everyone has a price. And a pain threshold."
Want to come along?
Tell me again why we're wasting time and dwindling resources chasing a legend. We don't even know it exists!
The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.
Damn the Jarls.
They demand the Moot.
And damn the Moot!
We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put Thorryg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on a silver plate.
All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.
A crown doesn't make a king.
"No, but this one..."
If it even exists.
It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause. Think about it.
The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before jarls and moots.
"Back to the time when a king was a king because his enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him."
"Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be."
You're certain you've found it?
When have I ever been false with you?
Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you.
Fancy a crawl through a moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?
It'll be there. You'll see.
I believe Galmar gave you something to do. So go do it.
"You're alive! I'm impressed! Galmar had his doubts about you, but I knew you'd pull through. You should speak with him. He's going to need your help."
Speak with Galmar. You'll be going on a little errand with him.
What? We've got nothing to talk about until you come back from Serpentstone Isle.
"You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think we'd be seeing you again."
I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak material.
It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?
You ready to take the Oath?
"Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim."
"You must also pledge unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her people."
You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that doesn't make you a Stormcloak.
We're not just fighting Imperials. We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king she deserves.
We hunt together.
Don't take too long figuring it out. Might mistake your hesitation for Imperial sympathies.
"Come back when you're committed to the cause, or go join the Legion. They're taking anyone with a pulse these days."
That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A hero of the people. A true son of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
[QUOTE]I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak...[QUOTE]
That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A heroine of the people. A true daughter of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
[QUOTE]I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak...[QUOTE]
"[QUOTE]All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim![QUOTE]"
Have you not heard that ancient verse?
"[QUOTE]Maw unleashing razor  snow, Of dragons from the blue brought down, Births the walking winter's woe, The High King in his Jagged Crown.[QUOTE]"
"Going way back to King Harald's time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It was the symbol of his might and power."
"The crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion of the power of  every king who has worn it."
"True or not, who would dare deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his brow?"
"It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian campaigns."
"But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following Wars of Succession."
"Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King Borgas - Korvanjund."
"If the crown exists, it will be there."
Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what profane arts those elves cursed his remains.
"Curses notwithstanding, the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers, are they not?"
"But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure you."
I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun.
Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.
I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun.
Deliver this axe to Jarl Hrongar.
And here I figured you as one who enjoyed our special gifts.
I guess I was wrong.
Hardly likely.
Just shut up and keep out of sight.
That definitely matches the description of the totem from Skjor's old book. Let's get it to the Underforge.
"That's it! That's the second Totem. Quickly, let's put it back with the other one."
At last... the final Totem is ours. Let's go complete our set.
"Let's find that Totem, Shield-Brother."
"Let's find that Totem, Shield-Sister."
Hircine will bless us for finding his Totem.
The spirit of Skjor is with us on this errand. I feel him.
This is not the time for talk. Let's get to the Underforge and see what this can do.
Do you have it?
I don't know what we do with it now. Maybe you can figure it out.
I've been hearing stories about dragons. That they're back. That they can eat the sun out of the sky and freeze a man where he stands.
Have you seen one in your travels?
Travelers have been coming to Whiterun. They tell stories about dragons.
"I've heard of them, but didn't think they were real. Have you ever seen one?"
"I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Brother."
"I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Sister."
You are a very brave man. But I already knew that.
You are a very brave woman. But I already knew that.
A sharp mind on you. We should find out for ourselves.
"That is the kind of thing Kodlak used to say. And he was right. But still, I'd like to see for myself."
"Yes! I like the way you think. There are whispers of where we might find one, too."
They say he killed twelve of the Imperial Legion and shattered their bones with his breath.
I think you and I are worth about a dozen soldiers each. We'll send that beast back where it came from.
"Well, that's one way to find out if they're real. I even know where we might find one. Lead on!"
"We don't all lead your life of grand adventure, Harbinger."
Not at this rate. I'll just go back to clubbing horkers and scaring the debtors.
Now that was a battle!
"Thank you, Harbinger."
For the glory of the Companions! For Ysgramor!
We bring honor to the Companions.
"I am sorry if I disappointed, Harbinger. Still, the battle was won."
I will train better for the future.
"I'm going to stay a while. Rest among these bones. This creature honored us with its life, and I will honor it with my respect."
"You go if you want to. I've never seen bones this large, and want to make sure I remember them so I can tell the story right."
Otherwise Vilkas will just say I was making it up.
There is always work for the Companions. But there is more personal task before me.
"Of course, there is always work. My mind is someplace else, though."
Kodlak's final teaching. I think he was right about beastblood and Sovngarde.
I wish to cleanse myself that I might know glory in the afterlife.
"I think that maybe Kodlak was right. As a werewolf, I can't be a good Nord."
"I want to be clean, like he was, and go to Sovngarde when I finally die."
"Thank you, Harbinger."
"I would be honored for you to accompany me, Harbinger."
"You still bear a head of the Glenmoril betrayers, yes? Then lead on, back to the Tomb of Ysgramor."
My soul is now prepared.
You still have one of the witch's heads. This is good.
Let's go to the Tomb. We can do the cleansing there.
"Aela said that the cleansing used a head from one of the witches of Glenmoril, yes?"
"A strange kind of ritual, but I won't mind killing those wretched things."
"Aela said we would need a Hagraven's head. I already have one of them, but she said it was a special kind."
And that you knew where to get more. Let's go find one!
Did you take the head?
"Lead on, to Ysgramor and glory."
This is good. Could you show the way to the tomb again?
Is it over?
I... it's like waking up out of a dream.
I can breathe more deeply now. I can't smell your heart beating the way I used to. But my mind is... clear.
"This is a great service you've done for me, Harbinger. I will not soon forget."
Now... I'd like to spend some time communing with Ysgramor. My soul is clean now. Perhaps he'll still welcome me when my time comes.
It's like relaxing into a warm mug of spiced mead. I'm losing aches I didn't know I had.
This is how a warrior should feel. Alive and aware. Not clouded with thoughts of the hunt.
"Thank you for your help. I'm going to stay in the tomb for a while. My shame kept me out before, but now I want to see it."
"You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite."
But the Elder Scrolls... they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one.
Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.
"And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand boy?"
"And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand girl?"
"I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions."
An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power.
"To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness."
"Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price."
"You think that even if I did have one here, I would let you see it?"
It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.
Of course.
What about... wait. Are you? Were you the one the Greybeards were calling?
"I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books."
"The simplest way to put it is [QUOTE]knowledge,[QUOTE] but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll."
It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts.
"Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading."
"But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods."
It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense.
"The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them."
"Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad."
Ha!
"The mine is rich, and so are we."
"But I am cursed, it would seem, to live alone."
I've had several wives. But each dies sooner than the last.
I was lucky to get children out of the ones I did.
"Everyone said it had run out, but I smashed down one wall and found the widest veins of ebony I'd ever seen."
So now we're rich and now I'm chief.
"I think of Uglarz. An old friend. When we were little she ran to the woods to hunt, and never came back."
"If someone found her, she would make an excellent mate."
"Ha. Good luck to you, friend. She's not one who likes to be found."
"I am Uglarz, huntress of all."
"It was my home. But I left. The woods felt more alive, at least for a time."
"Mauhulakh. I remember him. Little, scrawny, fellow."
Ha! Now that I would like to see. I may go back there some day.
Always thought that old mine had more to it. Just like Mauhulakh to smash his way to good fortune.
I'm going back to Narzulbur. Want to see how it's come.
Madanach! Think you can escape my prison do you? You'll pay for what you've done to my family!
"Your family? You've poisoned the Reach with your tainted silver for long enough, Thonar!"
My Saffir doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old sword.
He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.
"We have not faired well outside our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things."
"I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I bought it."
I tracked it to a group of bandits nearby. But I'm no fool. I'd need the Whiterun guards or maybe hire the Companions to get it.
"I don't know why I'm saying this, but if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you."
"Shahvee would be in your debt, kind one."
We will endure. We always have.
"Not your concern, anyway."
Very good. Be sure to bring any more Sleeping Tree Sap you find to me.
"Yes, Nightingale, what is it?"
"A moment, please."
I wish to speak to Karliah for the moment.
Karliah?
Gallus!
I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others.
"If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. He honors us all."
"If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. She honors us all."
"What will you do now, my love?"
Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.
Will I ever see you again?
"When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again."
"Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open... walk with the shadows."
"Goodbye, Karliah."
Gallus's Oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms.
Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam... the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow.
"No, not gone... he's become one with the shadows."
"This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can possibly achieve. In death, he's become a part of that which we use to live."
"Absolutely. When we say [QUOTE]walk with the shadows,[QUOTE] we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us."
It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck... by placing their hands in ours.
"That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through."
"I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there."
"Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities to [QUOTE]acquire[QUOTE] things from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty, now can we?"
"If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call."
"Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish."
Farewell. Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
"While technically in charge of the College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied. Thus, I run the day-to-day operations."
"Now, if you'll please follow me, I'll show you the living quarters."
There are no expectations. This College is a place to study and practice magic freely.
Hopefully any discoveries made in your pursuits will be shared with the members of the College first. That way we all benefit.
Balgruuf won't give us a straight answer.
Hrongar won't give us a straight answer.
He's a true Nord. He'll come around.
Don't be so sure of that. We've intercepted couriers from Solitude. The Empire's putting a great deal of pressure on Whiterun.
And what would you have me do?
"If he's not with us, he's against us."
He knows that. They all know that.
How long are you going to wait?
You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.
You think I need to send Hrongar a stronger message.
If by message you mean shoving a sword through his gullet.
"Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful statement, don't you think?"
So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?
Soon.
I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.
Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them with will need the support of our armies.
We're ready when you are.
Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed all the better. But if not...
The people are behind you.
Many I fear still need convincing.
Then let them die with their false kings.
We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The people are still weighing things in their hearts.
What's left of Skyrim to wager?
They have families to think of.
How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their families.
"Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?"
"I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that."
"Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?"
I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?
"I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil."
"I fight for their wives and children, who's names I heard whispered in their last breaths."
"I fight for we few who did come home, only to find our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces."
"I fight for my people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves!"
I fight so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing.
I fight... because I must.
"Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you will be High King."
"But the day words are enough, will be the day when soldiers like us are no longer needed."
I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.
"Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan."
I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war? Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.
Only the foolish or the courageous approach a Jarl without summons...
Do I know you?
"As you can see, I have much that requires my attention. If you're inclined to gab, there are some nice prison guards you may like to meet..."
Is that so...?
"Ah yes, you were with us at Helgen."
Ahhh. Yes...
"A fair point... Well, you've come to the right place, then. Speak with Galmar."
Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.
I'm always looking for able fighters. Not everyone can say they made it out of Helgen.
Seems we're all branded villains these days...
"So long as your criminal past stays in the past, and you fight for me with honor and integrity, we'll welcome you into our ranks."
"I'm not sure you belong here, friend."
"Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through all that, you're likely worth something to me."
Are you ready to for Serpentstone Island?
That's what I like to hear.
So long as you can back up those words with steel.
The kind men use to measure themselves.
It's where men have tested their mettle for ages.
"There's a strange rock formation, built by the ancients. Something about that place attracts the Ice Wraiths."
"You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and I'll have all the proof I need about you."
"I'm sending you to Serpentstone Island. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway."
Not so sure of yourself after all?
"At the end of the day, every warrior is alone."
"Before you can stand next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own."
"When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak."
"When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak."
Here. Take this. You'll need it. Use it on the island. Don't lose it. That's all the help you're getting.
Try not to die.
"We'll see about that, won't we?"
"We'll see about that, won't we?"
Here. Take this. You'll need it. Use it on the island. Don't lose it. That's all the help you're getting.
Try not to die.
Ralof's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good man.
"But he hasn't returned yet, so I'll need to wait for his account. For now, speak with Galmar."
"But first, tell me. Why's an Elf want to fight for Skyrim?"
"But first, tell me. Why's a cat want to fight for Skyrim?"
"But first, tell me. Why's a lizard want to fight for Skyrim?"
"But first, tell me. Why's an Orc want to fight for Skyrim?"
"But first, tell me. Why's a Redguard want to fight for Skyrim?"
"But first, tell me. Why's a Breton want to fight for Skyrim?"
"But first, tell me. Why's a foreigner want to fight for Skyrim?"
You mistake me. I'm not saying no - just wondering about your intentions.
We're not looking for sellswords. The Stormcloaks need dedicated men and women who're devoted to the cause and willing to die for it.
Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?
"Can't fault anyone for that! As long as you hate the Empire as much as I do, that I can work with."
"All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you."
Did you? So Ulag didn't make it passed those giants then? More's the pity.
"If you found any of the sap, I'd be willing to pay you the same cut I offered him. Better price than you are likely to find otherwise."
"Ah, of course! How much have you got?"
My daughter is the one who needs your pity. I'm just a poor Forsworn whose only regret is not killing more Nords before I was locked up.
I'm not Madanach. I was never a leader of the Forsworn. The only anger I can justify is my own.
"But every family in the Reach has a story like mine. There are no innocent onlookers in this struggle. Just the guilty, and the dead."
"Imagine hearing a story like that, over and over. Each time a different family Each time a different injustice."
"Your meddling above ground reminded me of how removed I've been from the struggle. My men and I should be in the hills, fighting."
"Yes, but I need a show of loyalty from you. I don't need a shiv in the back while we break out."
What? No. No don't kill me. Please!
Let me out. They're going to kill me!
"You know, I'm almost beginning to like you, but you haven't earned your place out of here yet."
"Have you met Grisvar the Unlucky? He's rightly named, and he's also a thief and a snitch."
"He's outlived his minor usefulness. Take care of him, and then we can leave Cidhna Mine for good."
You've finally become one of us. Come with me. I think it's time I announced my plans to you and your new brothers.
Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day now.
So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know that?
That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in handy.
"Lucky for us, that the wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now. Just up the road!"
"We're outnumbered, but I have a plan."
You got here just in time.
"Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is."
"That wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road."
"We're outnumbered, but I have a plan."
You got here just in time.
Skuldafn fen kos dinok.
Alduin saraan hin sil ko Sovngarde!
Het siiv nunon dinok.
"Boziik, Dovahkiin. Nuz mey."
Father won't let me go see the dragon.
Is it true? Did you really capture a dragon on the Great Porch?
A dragon in Dragonsreach. That's something I never saw coming.
So my brother really did it. Whiterun will be the toast of Skyrim for this!
I'll be glad when that beast is gone from Dragonsreach. I never understood what the point of all this was.
"Capturing that dragon was a mighty deed. In my younger days, I'd have been the first to join in the attempt."
"A captive dragon, just think of the possibilities!"
One of my main duties is to foster a better understanding between the Aldmeri Dominion and the people of Skyrim.
"I also oversee the activities of the Thalmor Justiciars throughout Skyrim, although this has been unfortunately disrupted by the war."
The Thalmor Justiciars are so often misunderstood. Our primary goal is to preserve the peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.
The worship of the false god Talos contributed to the unfortunate friction that led to the Great War.
"Following the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat set out the terms for peaceful coexistence between the two powers."
"The Empire and the Dominion agreed that the worship of Talos was a relic of the past, and must be eliminated in the interests of peace."
But I'm sure you didn't come here for a lecture on high politics.
"As long as the Empire continues to uphold its treaty obligations, my government does not concern itself with the internal politics of Skyrim."
You will release me - ro laan - if in return I promise to take you to Skuldafn and stop helping Alduin?
Do I? And what about you? What right did you have to meddle in my affairs? Kill my people? Was it worth it? Your truth?
"You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of your kinsmen stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you."
"You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of the Nord stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you."
"Then come for me, [QUOTE]son of Skyrim.[QUOTE] Come for me!"
"Then come for me, [QUOTE]daughter of Skyrim.[QUOTE] Come for me!"
"Very well. Come for me, then. Come and let's end this!"
"There's a man named Braig inside these mines. Besides me, he's been here the longest."
Tell him I sent you. Ask him why he's here. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.
"So many say that, at first, until they realize the truth."
"If you change your mind, speak to Braig. Tell him I sent you. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is."
This was our land. We were here first. Then the Nords came and put chains on us. Forbid us from worshipping our gods.
Some of us refused to bow. We knew the old ways would lead us back to having a kingdom of our own.
That is who we are. The Forsworn. Criminals in our own lands. And we will cut a bloody hole into the Reach until we are free.
"I had Markarth. My men and I drove the Nords out. We had won, or so we thought."
"Retribution was swift. I was captured, quickly tried, and sentenced to death. But my execution never came."
"Thonar Silver-Blood stopped it. He wanted the Forsworn at his call, that I would point their rage at his enemies and spare his allies."
"And I have. Humiliating at first, but I knew he would let his guard down eventually. That he would come to trust I was under control."
"My story, huh? Everyone in Cidhna Mine has a tale. Let's hear yours first. When was the first time you felt chains around your wrists?"
So you know what it's like to have your life in someone else's hands. Why should they get to decide? Isn't judgment for the gods?
Then you know the hard looks as judgment gets set upon you. The sneers of people who never had to face sentence.
Fine. Don't tell me. But I know that look in your eyes. Someone who's faced death at the hands of the law.
Do you have any family? Anyone waiting for you on the outside?
"I had a daughter, once. She'd be 23 this year. Married to some hot-headed silver worker or maybe on her own learning the herb trade."
"The Nords didn't care who was and who wasn't involved in the Forsworn Uprising. I had spoken to Madanach once, that was enough."
But my little Aethra didn't want to see her papa leave her. She pleaded to the Jarl to take her instead.
"And after they made me watch as her head rolled off the block, they threw me in here anyway, to dig up their silver."
The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it the Tower of the Dawn.
"I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was established inside."
When the temple was active the priests would rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary existence.
The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't it... a ruin within a ruin?
There's a small shrine to Mara I established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek spiritual guidance from Her.
Perhaps my prayers were answered and your reason for stumbling across Dawnstar is more than a mere coincidence.
"Follow me, it's this way."
It feels good to finally have a chance to help these people. Helplessly watching them suffer's been difficult.
He's deceiving you.
"When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you."
Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!
Beyond these doors is the inner sanctum and the Skull of Corruption.
Prepare yourself.
"Keep going, Casimir! Release the Miasma!"
We can't hold them back! Go! Get to the Barrier! Release the Miasma!
"We can't hold them! Go, Casimir! Run!"
"Release the Miasma! Release it now! Hurry, Casimir, hurry!"
We'll get him when he comes back around. Hold your fire.
"The torture room. Gods, I wish we didn't need these...."
Troll's blood! It's a torture room.
Skyrim is filled with all manner of dangerous beasts.
"Wolves, trolls, mammoths and giants would all like to make a meal of us."
"But the dragons are the most fearsome. Lucky for us, they don't seem to hunt along the roads."
"Yes, I was hired to protect the others as we walk the roads of Skyrim."
"It is a thankless task and I would rather be back home in Elsweyr, but I have little choice."
"Ahkari freed me from a prison in Cyrodiil, and now I must repay my debt to him."
"A word of advice, my friend --  do not mix gambling and drink. Taken together, they will empty your pockets of every septim."
"Well, not a great deal, no."
But I do less business than I used to. The Stormcloaks don't like buying from anyone that isn't a Nord.
"If I wasn't married to Ulfberth, I'd be out of business."
"Oh no, not at all."
"I simply locked the doors, hid beneath my counter and prayed to the Divines that my life would be spared and my shop wouldn't burn to the ground."
"But other than that, everything was business as usual. Now, do you have any other painfully obvious things to say?"
"Well, the Stormcloak guards drink a lot more than the Imperials did, so I've been making more money lately."
"On the other hand, they're a violent bunch. Every night a fight breaks out and I end up with a smashed chair or a broken table."
"So, not much has changed, really."
No more than I was already getting.
Four of the guards have already decided they're in love with me. Two of the guards got into a fight over me at the tavern.
"At least Balgruuf's men bathed regularly. These Stormcloaks always smell of ale and sweat, and their breath reeks."
My sister and I inherited a modest sum of money. We decided to travel and seek out whatever adventures we could find.
"As we journeyed across Tamriel, we encountered tales of exotic and wondrous artifacts. We decided to collect as many as we could."
"My sister passed away some years ago, so I settled down here and opened the House of Curiosities."
I think she would be happy to know that our collection has brought smiles to faces both young and old.
"Indeed I did! For a few septims, I'll tell you about some of the most interesting curiosities in my collection."
"Splendid! If you'll just follow me, I'll tell you tales and show you wonders such as you've never seen."
"It's you and me, prisoner. Stay close!"
Come on! We need to get inside!
Where are you going? The barracks is through here!
"Quick, I can cut you loose inside the keep."
We've got to get inside. Now!
"Very well. If you change your mind, you can usually find me here. In the meantime, feel free to look around."
These tools were found in a crypt outside Windhelm. They belonged to the ancient Nords who dwelt in Skyrim before the days of the First Empire.
Most scholars believe that the Nords of old used these implements to prepare their dead for burial.
What macabre mysteries would these tools reveal if they could but speak?
"Here is the Book of Fate, discovered in a secret room in the Arcane University."
"The writing in the book describes the destiny of its reader, so the words change from one person to the next."
"Some see only blank pages, and nobody knows why. Perhaps some of us are born with no destiny, or maybe the blank pages signify an imminent death."
"Ah, now here is an item out of legend. This is Ysgramor's Soup Spoon."
"Now, I know what you're thinking - this is no spoon, it's a fork! Nobody can eat soup with a fork!"
"Well, my friend, you did not know Ysgramor."
"Don't let this innocent-looking flute fool you, for this is the Dancer's Pipe."
"Legend holds that the Dancer's Pipe has won wars, toppled empires and changed the very course of history."
"None know its origins, but the stories say that men who hear its music are compelled to dance uncontrollably, no matter the peril."
"To activate this strange power, one must only speak the magic words, which are..."
"Oh my, I very nearly got us both into a nasty predicament, didn't I?"
"And with that, the tour is over. I thank you for your patronage, and I hope to see you again soon!"
Haven't you been listening to me? All the old tales agree that he has some means to travel to Sovngarde itself.
"There he devours the souls of the heroic dead to feed his power. You must find his portal to Sovngarde before he returns, stronger than ever."
The old tales say that he can travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
"You must find out how he does this, before he regains his strength and returns."
I've been a Nightingale for a very long time. I sold my allegiance to Nocturnal in exchange for many profitable years of thieving.
Falling in love with Gallus was wrong. It was a distraction that allowed the Sepulcher to be desecrated and it likely cost him his life.
"Until the Key is returned, I will never set foot inside that place again."
"Right now, the Guild needs someone to maintain order. Everyone is awaiting the news of Mercer's demise; it couldn't be a more precarious time."
I also need to reassure Maven that it's business as usual without Mercer... and that a new Guild Master will soon be taking over.
"Listen, lad. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective."
"Listen, lass. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective."
I can't think of anyone better suited to return the Key. Just remember to keep your eyes open and walk true with the shadows.
"Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests."
"Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but they insisted they had her favor."
"As part of their [QUOTE]duties,[QUOTE] the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies all on Nocturnal's behalf."
"These priests weren't threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated."
"One of their ceremonies involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so called [QUOTE]test of worthiness.[QUOTE]"
"If a pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said that they would become one with the shadows. What that means is anyone's guess."
"The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been in Skyrim... well, longer than recorded history."
The Twilight Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield it from those who would exploit its power.
"It's through this conduit that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains in return is a complete mystery."
"Bah, it's no use. Let's get back to it, then."
"Trust you saw the house that burned down. Peculiar bit of business, that was."
"And that's on top of noises from the marsh in the night, tales of monsters, and now this wizard in our midst."
What's a man to do if he can't look to his Jarl for help?
"Oh, well. You know. A bit of this, a bit of that."
"They haven't made me a guard, even though I've been asking. So I'll take odd jobs, anything that comes along for now."
"Wasn't by choice, I can tell you that."
"Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and nearly any money I make, he drinks away."
"Without the coin to pack up and leave, I decided to take to trading."
"Wasn't by choice, I can tell you that."
"Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and his drinking soaked up whatever coin we had."
"So I opened a shop to try and get by. Now, though..."
"Have to admit, I'm attached to the place. Suppose that makes me crazy, doesn't it?"
"It's not much, but we get by."
"Very little money passes through Winterhold anymore, but if there's one thing you can count on, it's folks needing a drink now and then."
"You mean the inn, or Winterhold?"
"Suppose it's the same answer, either way. Winterhold's fallen on hard times, to say the least. Most folk packed up and left years ago."
"A few of us are either too stubborn or too crazy to go, so we do our best to make a living."
"By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant."
"I assign you Lydia as a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office."
"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we?"
"We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn."
"I, ah, learned of a certain stone tablet said to be housed in Bleak Falls Barrow - a [QUOTE]Dragonstone,[QUOTE] said to contain a map of dragon burial sites."
"Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself."
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! You already found it! You are cut from a different cloth than the usual brutes the Jarl foists on me.
Very well.
The target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
"The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want."
"Remember, we want people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is the custom, and I can promise a bonus."
"Now go. And give the bride a special kiss, from me."
Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
"The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want."
"Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus."
Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.
"Just that, I'm afraid. You lack the ability, in any school of magic, to contribute meaningfully to the College's research."
I suggest you learn more on your own. Come back once you've attained some measure of success.
"Well, well. Look at you. Your kinsmen have turned you into an animal, Nord. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad."
"Well, well. Look at you. The Nords have turned you into an animal. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad."
"So, my fellow beast, what do you want? Answers about the Forsworn? Revenge for trying to have you killed?"
"Your freedom? Yes. But even if you were to escape Cidhna Mine, your name would still be stained with all that blood."
"Fralia, do you ever deal with the Khajiit at all? I'm sure they would love to trade in your husband's steel."
"Plenty of people here that need Eorlund's craftsmanship, my dear. We've never had any reason to deal with those caravans of theirs."
"Are you still working at the Bannered Mare in the evenings, Olfina?"
And why shouldn't I? Just because I'm a Gray-Mane doesn't mean I can't earn my own keep.
I didn't mean... I'm sorry I asked.
"Ah, Ysolda was it? What brings you to the market?"
"I'm here to buy food, Nazeem. I suppose you don't need to worry about that."
Owning a farm does have its advantages.
Did you see a Dog out there?
"Ah, well. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it."
"No, this was a specific one. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it."
I don't know really.  The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
"I asked the gate guards to look for him. I can't afford to chase him down but could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company."
Good! There's some gold in it for you if you succeed. Here's the meat - check the road just outside of town.
"No, no, this one's alone on the road outside of town. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company."
If you were willing to retrieve him for me I'd give you some fresh meat to attract him out on the road.
I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here outsider.
"You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out."
I only just got my hands on it. I can only work so quickly.
It's coming along slowly. I expect there will be some results soon.
We were able to figure out the last text you brought in. I thought the least I could do is pass the knowledge along.
Now... Now we see whether my theories are correct.
I apologize if I have not been clear about my work. I didn't want to discuss it for fear this moment might never come.
Everyone knows the dwarves disappeared. No one knows why.
This little experiment is a first step in recreating the events of their disappearance in an effort to unravel that mystery.
"Lacking the heart of a dead god, I am substituting the crystal you helped craft in its place."
"I also lack Sunder, the counterpart to the dagger Keening. I am reasonably, confident, however, that this will still work."
"I certainly don't expect it to have quite the same results. I'm no tonal architect, of course!"
"Well, I suppose it's time, isn't it? Let's see what happens. You, uhh... You may want to stand back a step or two."
"But please, don't leave. You've been instrumental in this process. I'd like you to see the results first-hand."
"Right, then..."
"Hmm. That... That didn't really do anything, did it?"
Perhaps a little harder?
I don't understand. This should produce some notable effect.
"Work, damn you!"
Suddenly I don't feel like fighting.
Why am I fighting?
I really don't want to fight.
I see no reason to keep fighting.
This fight makes no sense.
I'm not interested in fighting anymore.
I see no reason to fight.
There's no reason to fight.
I'm staying out of this.
This fight is pointless.
"Over there, please. Just opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way."
"I really do need you to stay in place, please. I don't want to risk hurting any of the other Apprentices."
The existence of so-called [QUOTE]Doomstones[QUOTE] throughout Skyrim has been repeatedly verified. The meaning of these stones has not.
The prevailing opinion of Skyrim natives is that the stones are indeed magical in nature.
"While there is no direct evidence of this, it does seem likely."
References to similar stones appear in lore throughout the various Tamrielic cultures.
"None, however, exactly match the markings or distribution of Skyrim's stones."
"At present, there is no confirmation of any of the various theories surrounding the nature of these stones."
"Their relative positions do not indicate that any individual stone is part of a larger, unobserved pattern."
"Also, their placement throughout Skyrim does not correspond to any known magical phenomenon."
The age of the stones themselves has yet to be officially determined. It has been widely assumed that they were placed during the Merethic Era.
"Writings from that period, including those of Ysgramor himself, do not mention the stones and thus this idea cannot be verified."
"Nonetheless, many are drawn to these stones based on the local stories describing them as a source of significant power."
"The College will continue to research these intriguing objects, and of course any findings will be relayed with all possible haste."
It is no secret that both the Synod and the College of Whispers have recently made inquiries as to the status of our College here in Winterhold.
"At this time, there is no indication that either group is aware of the other's correspondence."
The College of Winterhold has thus far declined requests for direct meetings. This has been at the specific request of Arch-Mage Aren.
"Aren believed that although the initial communications were innocent enough, they were sent with a particular motive in mind."
The Synod's harsh rules and draconian structure are maintained only by suppressing any opposition to their Council's policies.
It is entirely possible that they look to our College here in Winterhold in order to find supporters for their organization.
"Likewise, the College of Whispers has long been driven by its desire to directly oppose the Synod."
"They focus on research banned by the Synod, such as Conjuration and Necromancy."
The College of Whispers hopes to learn that our College also supports these avenues of research.
Thus they may claim that the Synod is indeed a political minority in the Empire and should be treated as such.
"Our actual position and policies are irrelevant. No matter the facts of the response, it will certainly be twisted to suit the whims of either group."
"Indeed, it has been jokingly suggested that we send the exact same response to both, which each will warp into support for their side."
"At present, these two groups do little beyond attempting to gain the attention and favor of the Emperor."
They appear to have little interest in real study and research for the sake of gaining knowledge.
"Arch-Mage Aren believes that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur."
"Arch-Mage Aren believed that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur."
Falling in with either would threaten to draw much unwanted attention to our College.
"If either group goes through less official channels and attempt to contact you directly, please refer them to the College's Master Wizard."
Say as little as possible so as to avoid compromising our neutral position.
"I would just like to remind everyone, once again, that Restoration is indeed a valid school of magic."
"It is absolutely worthy of research, despite many of the notes I've had left in my bed. And my desk. And on occasion, my meals."
"Anyone suggesting that Restoration is better left to the priests of the Temples, I think, is forgetting a few things."
"Firstly, the ability to repel the undead cannot be ignored."
"Skyrim is well known to be full of these... Draugr, ancient Nord warriors who cannot find peace."
"I submit that everyone in this College has, at one time or another, relied on one of the Restoration spells that can keep them at bay."
"Secondly, how can anyone forget wards? They have become essential to any mage working in dangerous situations."
"They are counted upon every bit as much as Candlelight, or Invisibility."
"But more importantly, wards have saved lives. This is a simple fact."
"Every mage in this College regularly uses wards for practice, so as to avoid physical harm."
"I truly hope that these points actually sink in, and that more care and thought is given to this subject in the future. Thank you."
"As many know, there is an ongoing effort to research the work of the Archmagus Shalidor."
"He is most remembered for his great maze of Labyrinthian, said to hold [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE], or the secret of life."
"While stories have persisted since the First Era, none have ever confirmed the existence of this [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE] or its purpose or function."
"The College has developed some theories, however."
We know that Shalidor had an understanding of magic that surpassed almost any of either his age or ours.
The few works of his that have been recovered suggest that he had an understanding of magic and the world that few have ever achieved.
"What is interesting is that it appears he was also incredibly prolific, writing on a diverse array of subjects."
"An array so great, in fact, that it remains a source of curiosity."
"What, then, of this Glamoril? It means [QUOTE]secret of life[QUOTE] in elvish. Could this be an explanation for Shalidor's works?"
Is it possible that it somehow contributed to his work? Perhaps allowed him to life multiple lifetimes in a short span of time?
Increased his intelligence and knowledge in ways unfathomable to us? We may never know for certain.
"The College is always searching for more of Shalidor's writings in an attempt to understand both our knowledge of the man, and of magic in general."
"At this time, I would like to make a few statements regarding policy here at the College."
Please refrain from practicing Conjuration spells in view of the town of Winterhold.
"Atronachs have a tendency to frighten the locals. Undead.... well, I don't even think it needs to be said."
Urag has asked me to remind everyone to please return materials borrowed from the Arcanaeum in the same condition as you received them.
"If this is impossible due to misuse or accident, Urag recommends finding a replacement copy to deliver to the Arcanaeum."
"Failure to do so will result in paying, in Urag's words, [QUOTE]a blood price.[QUOTE] I did not ask him to elaborate on that point."
"Once again, I must ask that everyone please clean up any materials used in the common areas."
We've had yet another sprained ankle due to soul gems being left on the floor. Let's please try and keep injuries to a minimum.
"The Midden remains off-limits at this time; while the initial outbreak has been cleaned up, the area is still considered hazardous."
"No more experiments are to be carried out there, and mages are advised that you enter the Midden at your own risk."
While Drevis appreciates the spellcasting skill that went into somehow cramming several hundred apples into his pillow...
He would ask that it please not happen again.
"He has suggested that, should he find out who is responsible, he is well versed in making things disappear permanently."
"There have been unconfirmed reports that someone has been sneaking into the town of Winterhold while invisible, and causing... issues."
"This goes quite against College policy, and the party responsible is advised to cease these actions at once."
Any information as to the whereabouts of the previous group of Apprentices would be greatly appreciated.
"As of yet, there has been no sign of them."
Projects are underway to discern the origin and nature of the College's recent find in Saarthal.
"Work continues on the Eye of Magnus, as it has been commonly referred to."
Any and all theories are currently being considered. Those with ideas should please speak with Mirabelle.
"At this time, there is no indication that, as has been rumored, the object is in fact a physical part of Magnus, the god of magic."
"It has been suggested that the object is a gateway to the realm of Aetherius, but nothing has proven that idea one way or the other."
It has been proposed that the object is in fact the entirety of Aurbis in one physical space.
"This would of course mean that Tamriel, indeed all of Mundus, is actually contained within the sphere."
It further suggests that we are somehow then outside our own existence while looking in at it.
"While the idea seems dubious at best, it has not, at present, been entirely ruled out."
It would ruin me.
"I have a good thing going here. The Jarl benefits from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible for her to admit that."
"Laila is a simple and traditional woman. Which makes it easy to manipulate her, but impossible to regain her graces once offended."
Look. Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?
"The Thalmor would need to make an example of me... I'd be thrown into prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations."
"I'm the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city."
Enough to make a significant difference in the war.
Enough to make a significant difference in the war.
"They're taking it by wagon to Windhelm. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far."
"It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men."
"Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion."
"They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far."
"It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men."
"Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion."
Well I...
"I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?"
Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?
I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon full of gold isn't good enough for you?
Well I...
"I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?"
Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?
I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon loaded with silver isn't good enough for you?
"Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've come to an agreement."
"Oh, no. I won't tell you anything more until we have an agreement."
"Nocturnal, save me..."
I return to the shadows...
I've... failed...
Noooo...
Come... embrace your death!
Become one with the Evergloam!
This place will be your tomb!
"Draw your last breath, mortal!"
Your presence will be revealed.
You can't hide from the hidden.
"Enough games, face your death!"
Hiding only prolongs your demise.
I have eternity to find you.
"Impressive, you've mastered the shadows."
A stirring in the dark?
I feel a change in the room...
The presence of the living is near...
The shadows have betrayed you!
"The games have ended, time to face your death!"
"Come mortal, let's end this here and now!"
Nocturnal will feed upon your soul!
An intruder in the Sepulcher!
"Make your peace, mortal!"
Defend the Sepulcher at all costs!
Destroy the intruder!
Let the darkness rip you asunder!
"You've breathed your last breath, mortal!"
Defend the Ebonmere! Kill the mortal!
I cast shadows across your grave!
A trick of the dark perhaps?
Perhaps it was nothing...
Victory for Nocturnal!
Another soul claimed for Lady Nocturnal!
Glory to the Empress of Murk!
The intruder has vanished.
I've failed... the mortal has escaped.
What? That's not possible!
"Most impressive, mortal... most impressive."
The shadows have failed you!
A fatal mistake!

No! Noooooo!
Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those plans behind unless he had his reasons.
"For someone in possession of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's play."
"No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it."
The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us... leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.
"I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we Nightingales need to stick together, eh?"
"A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities."
The thief had broken into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.
"Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago... before they became the blind monstrosities they are today."
"When Gallus took one look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold."
Didn't take long for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.
Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth?
"Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well."
There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans were shelved and the rest is history.
See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going!
Torolf!
Gods... Everyone get back!
Tell my family I fought bravely.
"The wounds are deep, Vilod! I can't stop the blood."
It's too late for that. Leave me. Save yourself.
"Come on. Give me your hand, I'm getting you out of here."
"Jarl Balgruuf? I don't mean to be disrespectful, as he's ruled Whiterun Hold well for years, but he seems in over his head now."
"He's been trying to stay out of the war, but it can't last. He's going to have to pick a side. I'm afraid he's going to make the wrong choice."
"I wouldn't say that. But he and Ulfric have been at odds for years, and I'm afraid Balgruuf will end up siding with the Empire because of it."
But it's hard to believe that even Balgruuf would choose Elisif over Ulfric.
Of course. Ulfric's cause is just. It's time for Skyrim to rid itself of the Empire.
I suppose she's Jarl Elisif now. She married High King Torygg just before Ulfric killed him. The Empire supports her claim to be High Queen.
I don't really have anything against her - not her fault that her husband Torygg was bought and paid for by the Empire.
"But she's nothing but a puppet for the Empire now, with her husband Torygg dead. Ulfric will make sure she never takes the throne as High Queen."
"Some say murdered, but it was a lawful challenge in the old way."
"Ulfric called him out as a traitor to Skyrim, and killed him in single combat."
"If Torygg couldn't defend his throne, he had no business being High King."
"No, not until the Moot meets to choose another. And it won't meet until one side or the other wins the war."
"Don't worry, though. Ulfric is our rightful High King. He'll drive out the Empire and Skyrim will have peace at last."
But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar.
"As a token of my esteem, I have instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase property in the city."
And please accept this gift from my personal armory.
Bottles of Moon Sugar. Khajiit use it as a... pick me up. Good way to pass the time.
Prisoners smuggle the stuff in. Only currency we have down here.
The new meat. So soft. Tender.
"What was it like killing your first one, huh?"
"A true killer, like me. The gods put us here to fill their halls with souls. You'll fit in fine down here."
Pah. The gods have a place for killers. You can't carry the burden? You're weak.
Liar.
"We have a nice arrangement in this city, and we're not letting you get in the way."
You have a problem wth that? Take it up with Madanach. I'm sure the King in Rags and his Forsworn would love to meet you.
Now you're coming with us. It's a life sentence in Cidhna Mine for you.
You think you're the only one who knows that? We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you showed up.
You'll have plenty of time to take it up with the King in Rags while you're serving a life sentence in Cidhna Mine.
Same thing we do with all the other natives who want to change things around here.
We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you and Eltrys started snooping around.
"Well, you wanted to find the man responsible for those killings? You'll have plenty of time with the King in Rags when you're in Cidhna mine."
You want to talk to the King in Rags? Fine. But first you got to pay the toll.
"How about you get me a shiv? Not that I need one, but it's nice to have in case I need to do some [QUOTE]shaving.[QUOTE] Ha ha."
You ready to pay the toll? One shiv.
Hmph. Fine. Go on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach knows more than you think.
The only thing Madanach expects is a bottle of Skooma in tribute every so often. You're not getting through.
"All right, head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think."
Then find one. That dung heap Grisvar's been known to make a few.
"Those eyes. All right, killer, go on through. But don't try anything. Madanach knows more than you think."
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
That's right. Turn around and leave.
"Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense."
"Mercer may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny."
Old Delvin kept calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's on us.
"If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now I think our chances have improved."
"Look, call me crazy if you like, but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal path."
"Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercer's blood on my blade than spend the rest of my life regretting that I ran the other way."
"With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts."
You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with Nocturnal.
"In order for us to receive our abilities... our end of the bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned."
"If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me... with any of us, she wouldn't have answered my call."
I have no doubt that we still hold her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat Mercer Frey.
"Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your home."
You'll find that this place offers many things that will help you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to learn.
"Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well."
"Years ago, the Guild used to have a foothold in every major city in Skyrim. You wouldn't dare even lift an apple without checkin' with us."
"When things started goin' downhill around here, it became difficult to keep it all together. We lost fences, influential contacts and coin."
It wasn't long before we lost what we depend on to survive... respect.
"By doin' these extra jobs and puttin' some fear into the people, we can take back the cities and start bein' taken seriously once again."
"Are you kidding me? Ever since the Guild's luck turned sour, we haven't had a coin to our name."
"And when the coin dried up, that's when people started to leave."
We had the best of everything down here... the Ratway was a damn palace.
The only way this place will ever return to its glory days is if we can finish these extra jobs and start the gold flowing again.
"Thanks to Maven Black-Briar, we still have some pull in Riften. But get arrested in Whiterun and you'll be tossed right into the prisons."
"If we can gain the confidence of someone very influential who lives there by doing a unique job for them, we'd be able to have some leverage there too."
The only way to get that special job is by doin' smaller ones in those cities until we catch their ear... then they'll contact me and we're off.
"The Flagon was once a city beneath a city. We had our own smith, our own alchemist... you name it."
"If we can make a name for ourselves in Skyrim once again, I can almost promise you those merchants would return."
"Best of all, we'd have enough gold to throw around so we can start living in the lap of luxury again."
"I'm here to assist anyone interested in joining the College. Also, my presence tends to frighten the locals and keep them away."
The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive. No one was expecting it. Monstrous waves battered the shore for weeks on end.
"Winterhold was ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire districts of the city were lost overnight."
"The waves receded in time, but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned what was left of the city."
"The College survived, and so here we remain."
Purpose? I should think it's self-evident.
"Magic is a true power, not something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion by politicians."
"It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It deserves proper respect and study."
"The College is a place where we can focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us."
Purposely killing your fellow College members is a bad idea. I'd advise against it. Theft and assault can get you into trouble as well.
"As for research... Well, a sufficient explanation will cover almost anything."
"If you're going to need live test subjects for your experiments, it's easier to do that off of College grounds."
A dragon? In Helgen? It can't be... although...
It would explain what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I thought I must have just been seeing things...
I'm sorry to turn you away. I hope you understand.
"But look... if you need work, Hod can always use help at the mill."
I don't know why... but I actually believe you. You've got the look of someone who's just seen a dragon.
"Things just go from bad to worse. First the war, now dragons... what's this world coming to?"
"You're right, I saw it. But... how's that possible? Dragons don't exist... they're just stories from long ago..."
The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...
"We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever troops he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt."
There's something you could do for me. For all of us here.
"If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to."
"Welcome to the Vilemyr Inn. If there's anything I can get you, just let me know."
"Finally, someone comes in. Kick off your boots, stay awhile. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with. I got nothing but time these days."
Come on in. The Silver-Blood Inn has plenty of strong drink and clean rooms.
"Ah, a visitor. Old Hroldan Inn has hundreds of years of history, friend."
"If you've got the coin, you've come to the right place. Pull up a seat."
"Come on in. Let me know if you need anything, or take a seat by the fire and I'll send someone over."
Come on in. Just stoked the fire. Take a seat and get the cold out.
Welcome. Let me know if you want anything... think I got a clean mug around here somewhere.
"Come on in. We got warm food, warm drinks, and warm beds."
You want a drink?
"Lynly, would you mind taking care of the customer please?"
"Hey, Talen... get off your lazy tail and take care of the customer!"
"Frabbi, a customer needs a drink!"
"Saadia, wake up dear!"
"Look alive, will you!"
No problem.
Keep your scales on.
Too lazy to give him a drink yourself? Oaf.
"Yes, mum!"
Yessir!
Kill him.
"You're mine now, Logrolf."
Yes!
You forsake the weak and pitiful Boethiah?
Yes!
You pledge your soul to me?
Yes!
You bend to me?
"Ah ha ha! You mortals and your frail, limp, pathetic bodies. Try it again."
"That's all I can do, you idiot. What are you waiting for?"
"Ah, freedom. Now get out of my way. I have a task to attend to."
I have a choice?
So. The King of Corruption sends his messenger to challenge me. Very well.
"I will meet with Molag Bal, and I will venerate his altar in Boethiah's name, as I did before."
"Cut me loose, minion of the Hated One. I need to get to Markarth."
You? A servant of the King of Corruption? Has the beast's standards fallen so far? Tell me another one.
Fine. I won't ask questions. Cut me loose.
"You think it's money I need? I'm a prisoner, not a beggar."
The Dark Mistress? She sent you? Wait. Molag Bal's altar. Of course.
I have to get to Markarth at once. Cut me loose.
The Dark Mistress? Sent you? Ha. Now tell me the one about the Troll who gives gifts to good little boys and girls.
"Reason, reason, reason. Your kind and their reasons."
Go. Your very presence sickens me.
Be warned. You have been marked by the Thalmor.
"Now remove yourself from my presence, while you still draw breath."
Go now. Return to your pathetic pursuits.
"Filthy Nord. In time, your entire race will be eradicated."
The Justiciars know your face. And we elves have long memories...
"Back to the swamp with you, Argonian. Lest I carve you into boots."
"Crawl back into whatever pit spawned you, Orc."
"Slink away now, little Khajiit, with your tail between your legs."
"Flee from my sight, Dunmer, or I'll have you shipped back to Vvardenfell in a crate."
Pathetic excuse for an elf...
You are a disgrace to the Altmer. I should kill you on general principle.
You drove them off? By yourself?
"Thank you! We'll head back to work, right away. Take this, it's the least I can do."
The Jarl has recognized you as a person of great importance in the hold. A hero.
"The title of Thane is an honor, a gift for your service. Guards will know to look the other way, if you tell them who you are."
"This here's Rorikstead. Quiet place. Good people, though. You can get a room and a mug at the Frostfruit Inn if you care to stay."
That's the Honningbrew Meadery. Supposed to be a big rivalry between them and the Black-Briars of Riften.
Remember when that used to be the Honningbrew Meadery? Didn't stand a chance against those Black-Briars of Riften.
This is Karthwasten. Mining town. I hear they've had a lot of trouble with the Forsworn.
"This here's the Darkwater. Comes down from Lake Honrich into the White River, a few miles downstream. Good fishing, I hear."
"Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Whiterun, but a nice enough place if you like swamps."
Here we are. Dawnstar. Capital of the Pale. Don't get up this way much. Beautiful country though.
I can't say I've been to Winterhold more than a handful of times. Can't see much reason most honest folk would want to come up here.
"Well, this is Falkreath. Not much to look at if you're used to the bigger cities, but the folk here are friendly enough if you give them a chance."
The Braidwood Inn's up that way. I know the innkeeper - Iddra. Nice lady.
"Shor's Stone - pissant little town, not even an inn. Just a bunch of miners scratching in the dirt."
It seems we may have an agreement.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.

"I'm done for, little cub. Go. Run for it!"
"It worked, then? Let me see!"
"Goodness, that's it, isn't it?!"
"Yes! It's not perfect, but it's a close enough approximation that it should certianly suffice for initial tests!"
"You've done excellent work here. Truly excellent. There's only one thing missing now, and that should be arriving shortly."
I'll begin preparations. Thank you again so much for this.
How in the name of Akatosh... How do you have that?
"The dagger...? By Akatosh, they didn't even wrap it correctly?"
"You didn't touch it did you? Well no, of course you must have! Did you attempt to wield it? And you're not dead?"
"Gods, it's a wonder it's in one piece!"
This is not just a dagger!
"This is a dwarven artifact beyond nearly all value. A singular instrument of immense power, a tool of impossible import."
"Keening, and its counterpart, Sunder. Used by the tonal architects of the Dwemer to tap into the Heart of Lorkhan."
I do... I do indeed.
"Keening, one of the great tools of Kagrenac himself, is finally in my possession. I don't think I really believed this day would come."
"Mine? Oh no, the stone is yours. I simply need to borrow it a moment..."
"Now, let's see what there is to see."
"It's magnificent, isn't it?"
I need only look for a few moments...
"Ahh, yes. I see it now."
And so it is done.
"I have the knowledge I need. And so you may have your stone back, and also please take this."
You have done well.
I think it only fitting that the Arch-Mage personally receive a large portion of the reward. Well done.
Good. One less worry for my people.
Revenge? No. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to bend his knee and give me his soul.
"He comes by to perform Boethiah's insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing. Captured and bound. Left to rot."
"Save him. Let him perform his rite one more time. And when he does, we will be waiting for him."
Fine. I offered you a reward. You'll get the freedom your kind enjoys so much.
But Boethiah's priest is imprisoned as well. But not by me. He is hurt. Suffering.
"Save him. Let him perform his rites one more time. And when he does, I will be waiting for him."
Damn right. Just like all true sons of Skyrim should.
Damn right. You don't have to be a Nord to fight for Skyrim's freedom.
"Ulfric's capital is Windhelm, northeast of here. You'll want to talk to Galmar Stone-Fist, Ulfric's right-hand man. He handles the new recruits."
I'll be sure to put in a good word if I get to Windhelm ahead of you.
You should come to Windhelm with me and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.
"If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric."
I hope so. Skyrim needs people like you to fight for her freedom.
"Come on, we'd better get moving."
"Yeah, sure, I understand. No need to decide now."
"But I know that after you think about what you saw today, you'll realize that Skyrim deserves to be free."
No way to know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here.
Fool! None may know my secret!
"I'm just a poor old woman, dear. No need to trouble yourself with me."
It's so nice to have a visitor.
I get so lonely out here.
"It's tough, just scraping by out here. But I make do."
"See you on the other side, mortal."


Excellent work. I knew you'd bring back something useful.
Good job. I knew you'd come back with something for me.
Fire!
"There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word."
"There's a sentry patrolling the area. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word."
"All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge. Good luck!"
"All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you. Good luck!"
The Daedra has us. It's you or me!
Yes. Further. Into the bowels.
So close. Your prize is waiting.
Damn. It's like everyone in this city has amnesia.
"Sharp, aren't they? This was the last thing many saw before they were sacrificed in my name."
"But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. So long since it's tasted blood. Until you came."
Hey there! I was wondering if I'd run into you out here.
"The Reach is a beautiful but dangerous place, eh? One false step and you'll fall to your death, that is if those Forsworn don't get you first."
Have you seen those Briarheart men? That's some evil magic right there.
What brings you? You have the look of purpose in your eyes.
Ready to do this?
"We're going to take out their sentry, then sneak into their camp and ambush them."
"We make quite a team, eh?"
I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You get back to camp with news.
Have them send some men - with a new wagon. This one isn't going anywhere.
"First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate ourselves overlooking the camp."
"Next, you'll infiltrate their position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows."
"With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a little."
"All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like things have gotten out of hand."
Good idea. Let me know when you're ready.
Let me know when you're ready.
Good.
"In my time, the Blades protected the Emperor. It would seem these Penitus Oculatus will prove equally incompetent."
"Stalking your prey, planting false evidence, destroying an innocent man's reputation. Truly a contract worthy of the Listener."
The Keeper is a sacred position within the Dark Brotherhood. Ask yourself - do you trust the wisdom of our Lady?
"I will kill this jester if you so desire, but there is a disturbance in the Void. Our Dread Father does not wish this."
Killing the Gourmet will leave an emptiness in the collective soul of Skyrim. This pleases me.
"Yes. Kill the chef, and then steal his very identity. For that is the true death."
"A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself."
"My time saw the assassination of an Emperor as well. Alas, the Dark Brotherhood did not have the honor of that kill."
We must return to the Sanctuary! Your Family is in dire peril!
"We are the messengers of death, you and I. Together, we will unleash the unholy wrath of our Dread Father, Sithis."
The Sanctuary must be purged of its invading filth!
"The time has come to fulfill your destiny, Listener. Kill the Emperor, and restore the Dark Brotherhood to greatness."
"You stand now at the precipice of the Void. I am reminded of another Listener, a protege I knew long ago. So long ago..."
"Ah, yes. Solitude. Seat of the High King of Skyrim. Messy business, kingslaying. Ah, but so very satisfying..."
"Windhelm. White as bone, and cold as the Void."
I do so love Riften. I journeyed here in my youth. A thief took my purse... so I took his eyes. It was a fair exchange.
"Whiterun, home of the Skyforge. It is said a blade forged in its fires can cut through sinew as if it were parchment."
"An ancient city, Markarth. Build by the Dwemer, the dwarves of old. To think, an entire race... eradicated. Not even I can take credit for that feat."
"Do you feel it? Magic. Deep and ancient. It resonates from the College, like the beating of a heart."
"You know, a good Purification might be just what this Sanctuary needs..."
"Dreary, dank, and dimly lit. Truly a Sanctuary to call home."
"Shadowmere, my old and dear friend..."
All hail the savior of the Dark Brotherhood! All Hail the Listener!
"One day, you will serve our Dread Father as I do now."
"I remember Skyrim from my youth, and the glistening crimson on fields of white."
I live... again.
I grow restless. As does my blade.
Your enemies will soon know the wrath of Sithis.
"Lead, and I will follow, child of darkness."
Perhaps we should find a random stranger to murder. Practice does make perfect.
"Lead on, sister."
"Lead on, brother."
"We are bonded now, you and I. Joined, through the powers of the Void."
"In life, I was but a Speaker for the Black Hand. But you have been named Listener. There is no higher honor."
"Have you heard the tale of Mathieu Bellamont, and the great treachery of Cheydinhal? Kill a boy's mother, and vengeance festers in the son..."
My blade is yours.
There is murder in the air. I can taste it.
The Dread Father works through me. And his work has just begun.
My Listener?
What prey awaits us?
UUggghhhh.....
UUggghhhh.....
UUggghhhh.....
UUggghhhh.....
"Riften. Cicero likes Riften. Cheats and ruffians and cutthroats abound. Finally, some fun."
"...Cicero never understood thieves, really... take someone's things before you kill them? And they call me crazy..."
Brrrr... Chilly.
"Oohhh... Cicero's heard about the Butcher. Interesting knifework. Just... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab! And then... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!"
Hmph. [QUOTE]Solitude.[QUOTE] Lonely Cicero could tell you a thing or two about solitude...
"...the High King's court needs a jester... But not me. No, not Cicero. The Fool of Hearts is busy enough, thank you very much..."
"...I saw a dwarf! I did! I did! Cicero saw a dwarf! There... Oh. No, sorry. No dwarf..."
...Forsworn think they're so scary... Cicero will show you who's scary... Stupid Forsworn...
"...Oooh... Cicero wants some Skyforge Steel! Sharp sharp, for easy stabbing..."
Oh! Oh! Maybe Cicero will go to Jorrvaskr and dance for the Companions! They'll... Um... On second thought... maybe not.
He he he he he he he he he he.
He he he... Crazy? Cicero? He he he he... That's madness...
"...ho ho ho, and hee hee hee, break that lute across my knee... and if the bard, should choose to fight, why then I'll set his clothes alight..."
"...and if I spy a singing bird, I'll snap its neck before it's heard..."

"...madness is merry, and merriment's might, when the jester comes calling with his knife in the night..."
"...What? Mother? Is that your voice I hear? Hmm... No, no... Just my head playing tricks... Foolish Cicero..."
(Whistling)
"Our sweet Lady is maiden, mother... and crone..."
"...need to sharpen my blade... make it shiny, gleamy, and oh so deadly..."
"...dear Cicero will keep you from harm, sweet Mother. Forever and always..."
...is there singing in the Void? Dancing...? Surely the Dread Lord will at least allow poor Cicero to caper...
...Cicero is hungry... ...need a sweetroll... or a carrot...
"...need to get Mother some flowers... pretty, pretty flowers..."
...must oil Mother soon... ...get all the hard to reach places...
Leave... Leave... Leave...
(Sigh)
Do you hate the dark elves? Are you here to bully us and tell us to leave?
Then we have nothing more to talk about.
"You've come to the wrong city, then. Windhelm's a haven of prejudice and narrow thinking, unworthy of one such as you."
"I make no secret of it. I don't care if the Empire controls the city or not, I won't hide my loyalty to the dream of a free Skyrim."
"Ulfric fought for that dream with more courage and honor than any Nord who ever lived. But now he's gone, and the dream is gone with him."
"But I'll be ready when a new leader takes up the cause. As sure as ice is cold and stone is hard, I'll be ready."
I've scraped this collection together by whatever means I could.
"I do some business with the trade caravans, and I've picked up a number of items from adventurers like yourself."
"A few intrepid souls even brought some items back from Morvunskar, the fort southwest of the city."
"Oh yes. After all, what's the point in being miserable all the time?"
I know life on the docks isn't easy. Sometimes life puts you in difficult circumstances you didn't choose.
"But being happy or unhappy is a choice you make, and I've chosen to make the best of things that I can."
"His name is Torsten Cruel-Sea. He's really rich, 'cause he owns a farm called Hollyfrost."
"He told me once that he wanted me to grow up and be a sailor, 'cause that's where our family name comes from."
But I don't want to be a sailor or a farmer. I want to be a warrior! The strongest one ever!
"His name was Torsten Cruel-Sea. He was really rich, 'cause he owned a whole farm called Hollyfrost."
"He told me once that he wanted me to grow up and be a sailor, 'cause that's where our family name comes from."
But I don't want to be a sailor or a farmer. I want to be a warrior! The strongest one ever!
I am not yours to toy with!
"I... I submit. What is your bidding, master."
"No, I... I submit. No more."
What is your bidding?
"Yes, my lord. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone."
"Yes, my mistress. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone."
Your sigil stone. Lord Dagon is... less than pleased at its loss.
"You should be pleased, Elisif. You've done well for yourself as the Empire's pet Jarl."
"But beware - the Empire's loyalty is fickle. They will tire of this war, and then I will be the one dictating terms to you."
"What about you, Elisif? Are these terms to your liking? Speak up. I'm sure General Tullius is waiting to do your bidding."
I have nothing to say to that murderer.
"General, you've proven yourself a good friend to Skyrim. I continue to trust that you will do your utmost to safeguard our interests."
"Thank you, Jarl Elisif. I appreciate your loyalty."
The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war.
"After that, Ulfric... there will be a reckoning. Count on it."
"You did well here today. I don't think the truce will last long, but that will not be on your account."
I fear this truce will not last. You gave the Empire too much. Ulfric will not let that stand for long.
I fear this truce will not last. General Tullius will be looking for any opportunity to regain the advantage.
You had best take advantage of this truce while it lasts.
"On your way up the 7,000 Steps again, Klimmek?"
Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.
Aren't the Greybeards expecting some supplies?
"Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day."
"Hey, remember that girl, Eisa? The one who sliced open that pickpocket they threw in here?"
"The Blackblood girl? Now there was a fighter. If I didn't know better, I'd say she was a Forsworn woman."
Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.
"Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here?"
"Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs of him being this, what, [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE]"
"Capable as she may be, I don't see any signs of her being this, what, [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE]"
Nord nonsense?! Why you puffed-up ignorant... these are our sacred traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire!
"I meant no disrespect, of course."
It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with him?
It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with her?
"That's the Greybeards' business, not ours."
"Whatever happened when you killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it."
"If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue?"
You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards. It's a tremendous honor.
Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.
"So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons."
"Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me."
"Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there."
"Off to Bleak Falls Barrow with you. The Jarl is not a patient man. Neither am I, come to think of it."
"I don't know if you've heard, but Jarl Balgruuf said my work is a priority. Which means you should be on your way."
I want to hear about this dragon.
I wonder what Irileth is so excited about?
"The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout."
"If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift."
"Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath."
"If you're asking, that means you're the new lifer. Tough luck, friend. Those guards sold you out but good."
"No one talks to Madanach, I'm afraid. Not without getting past Borkul the Beast."
And you don't want to talk to Borkul the Beast.
"Madanach's guard. Big, even for an Orc. Heard he ripped a man's arm off and beat him to death with it. He's old-fashioned like that."
Fresh food. No wood rot on the furniture. Someone's been here. Recently.
But the people I asked say no one enters or leaves....
Wait. Did you hear that? I think it came this way.
"That's it. Something's inside the house. Come on, we're getting to the bottom of this."
Come out! We know you're here!
There's another door. See if you can get it open.
Stendarr's Mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra. We have to get help.
Weak. He's weak. You're strong. Crush him.
You first. Come on. Let's go.
No. Kill him. Crush his bones. Tear at his flesh.
"Get out of my head, Daedra!"
"You will kill. You will kill, or you will die!"
I don't want to die. I can't die here!
You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you. You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility.
"Make your way to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital."
Make your way to our camp in the Rift. We have a few surprises for the Stormcloaks lined up.
You're needed in Winterhold. Report to our hidden camp there.
Get over to our camp in Hjaalmarch. We need to strengthen our defensive position.
I trust you've come to see the error handing the hold over to the rebels?
Make your way to our camp in Falkreath. We're going to take it back.
And don't think I've forgotten that you were the one that gave it to Ulfric in the first place.
Hurry over to our military camp tucked away in the Reach. Ulfric's been enjoying those silver mines for far too long.
"And, soldier. You better help win me back Markarth, or die trying. It was your brilliant strategy to give it over to the rebels in the first place."
You've little time to glory in your accomplishments.
We're gathering for our final assault on Windhelm. Report to our camp in Eastmarch.
"I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit."
"But I also want you to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital."
Get over to our camp in the Reach. They need every able body they can muster.
You're needed in Hjaalmarch. There's much to be done.
Get over to our camp in the Pale. It's time we bring them back into the fold.
And don't think for a moment I've forgotten it was you that lost us the hold in the first place.
Get up to Winterhold. We're going to take it back.
I know you thought we weren't losing much when you gave it to the enemy. But I'm wasting troops guarding the border that belong on the front lines.
Make your way to our hidden camp in the Rift. I can't continue to push forward when I'm worried about Eastmarch's southern border.
"I hold you responsible for this situation. So, you better win me back Riften, or die trying."
"We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's cousin is getting married!"
"If royal blood was spilt, all of Cyrodiil would be up in arms. We can't afford an all out war with the Empire. So we'll bide our time for now."
"We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's visiting! The goddamned Emperor!"
"And, as much as I'd like to kill the man myself, we can't risk an all out war with the Empire. We'll bide our time for now..."
You've no time to glory in your accomplishments.
We're gathering for our final assault on Solitude. I need you there. Report to our camp in Haafingar.
"You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way."
"You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them."
For the Empire!
For the Emperor!
Gods be with you.
Talos guide you.
Go with the gods.
For Skyrim!
Sir!
Sir! I... I have... <breathing hard>
"Take a moment to breathe, soldier."
But... sir...
Breathe!
The outer walls are strong. If we can hold them there...
They have catapults.
Damnit. Where'd they get catapults? The city walls are already falling apart as it is.
My scouts tell me they're loading them with fire.
"So, he wants to take my city, walls intact."
The men will be fighting in flames.
My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried about.
If you prefer I took my men and left...
No. Of course not. Just - don't let me down Cipius.
We'll need to set up water brigades to combat the flames.
Already taken care of.
"You Imperials are efficient, I'll give you that."
How long until they arrive?
Sir.
Not long. They're hiding in the country side.
Damnit. What's he waiting for?
Sir!
What?!
"Sir, they're on the move. They'll be at the gates at any moment!"
Why didn't you say so immediately?!
"Sir, I tried."
This is it! Time to see what these Stormcloaks are made of.
The men are already gathering at the gates.
Move it soldier. Spread the word. Go. Go. Go.
Oblivion take them. Every miserable last one of them.
"Well then, you're talking to the right person. I'm the only one left in Tamriel that can get my hands on it."
It's damn near impossible to find anymore. You want to buy it off of me?
I do. Still want to buy it?
"Good. Here, take this key."
The Balmora Blue is locked in a chest under the docks near the Red Wave. Hope you like getting wet.
"Sorry, guess it's too rich for your blood. Come back when you find the coin."
"I'm afraid not. How else can a poor, overworked sailor like myself expect to earn a living?"
"I'm sorry you feel my illegal contraband is overpriced, perhaps you should bring it up at the next merchant guild meeting."
"Look, you want it, I got it. You know the price, so talk to me when you want to cough up the gold."
"Not sure. I know that it starts with Moon Sugar, but all sorts of other ingredients are added to increase its potency."
Used to be a lucrative underworld commodity when Balmora was still standing. Now the stuff is beyond valuable.
It's also very illegal. Anyone caught with Balmora Blue looks forward to rotting in jail for a very long time.
There's pirates and then there's the crew of the Red Wave. They're in a class by themselves.
They usually make runs along the coast shipping all sorts of contraband to and from Morrowind.
Rumor has it they can get you anything for the right price.
No. This coven has existed for thousands of years. Namira is a goddess. She has been worshipped since time began.
I'm honored to be leading the latest generation of Namira's faithful. Those who have embraced what they are.
"Well it stops now, and that's final!"
"I play the lute. If you'd like to hear something, it only costs five gold."
That's so sweet of you.
"I'll tell you what... I'll play a special song, just for you, for no charge at all."
"Why thank, you... you're very kind. Still interested?"
"Thank you, milord."
"Thank you, milady."
Very well.
"Right away, milord."
"Right away, milady."
"My business is falling apart, my apprentice never listens to me and now there's talk of dragons."
"If I hadn't sunk every bit of gold I had into my mill, I would have picked up and left Ivarstead long ago."
My father taught me an important lesson many years ago.
"He said [QUOTE]Gwilin, you have the whole world before you. Go out and experience it... be whatever you want to be.[QUOTE]"
"So I took his advice, and here I am. This life might not look like much to you, but I'm content, and isn't that all that matters?"
"I am not your plaything, worm!"
Never!
I'll tear out your heart first!
Would you like to buy a lady a drink?
What would Hroggar say if he heard I was drinking with you?
Forget about Hroggar. He's always so tired lately. I need someone with a little fire in their blood.
After all you've put that man through. You should be more loyal to him.
"I'm bored, Benor. Nobody wants to have any fun with me."
"If you leave that kinslayer Hroggar, I would be happy to keep your company."
Hroggar doesn't have to know if we sit together. Or drink together. I doubt he would even care.
"You tempt me mightily, Alva. But I won't cuckhold another man, even on murderer like Hroggar."
"In a fight, if you see a big wind up, get out of the way or bash him with your shield. Attacks like that go right through a regular block."
"When the other guy has his shield up, regular blows are useless. Wind up and hit him with a really powerful attack to get past that shield."
"Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow."
"Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again."
Only a fool lets himself get surrounded. Back up and make them come at you one at a time.
"Those big, powerful blows are tiring. Pace yourself until you've got the stamina to do one."
"Any fool can just flail about, swinging his weapon as fast as he can. Any fool can die. Keep your guard up and wait for an opening."
Make sure to pull your bow all the way back to get the most power out of your shot.
Don't just stand still to do your big wind-up blows. Which way you're moving changes what happens and can be a big advantage.
"If you want to sharpen your blade, use the grindstone. Although you'll need the right raw materials, such as iron or steel."
"Want to improve your armor? Use the workbench. Make sure you have the right raw materials, such as iron or steel."
"If you want to make new armor or weapons, use the forge. It takes plenty of raw materials though, such as iron or steel."
"Before you can enchant your weapon or armor, you'll need to learn an enchantment by sacrificing an enchanted item. Just use the arcane enchanter."
"If you know an enchantment and have a filled soul gem, you can enchant armor and weapons. Just use the arcane enchanter."
"You can eat an ingredient to learn one of its properties. However, they taste disgusting."
You can make your own potions by mixing up to three ingredients together. Just use the Alchemy Lab.
She's mine! She's my reward. You can't have her!
I won't let you hurt Alva!
You've ruined everything!
"Oh, all right then, Listener. Cicero will just carry on with what he was doing. Until you say otherwise."
"Very well, Listener."
"As you wish, Listener."
Ooh! Listener! That tickles!
Of course.
"Yes, Listener."
Argonian Ale! I can almost taste it!
Then we got nothin' more to talk about.
Good. You're clearly better suited than I am to carry out such a menial task.
"Well, let's see... travel-stained clothes, worn soles, blank and unintelligent expression... Yes, in fact you do."
Stay close to the wall!
"Get up, papa! Get up!"
"Haming, you need to get over here. Now!"
"Gods guide you, Hadvar."
That a boy. You're doing great.
"Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way."
"That's it, son. Make me proud."
"You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord."
I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this.
I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.
So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.
You went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work.
Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.
You have a visitor.
"Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems."
"Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well..."
Wait for me.
"Oh, I thought you were already on your way to Bleak Falls Barrow..."
What are you still doing here? The Jarl said retrieving that stone tablet is a priority. Remember?
Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!
"You'll have to see the Jarl about that. Maybe his steward, Avenicci. I'm sure one of them will pay you appropriately."
"That is where your job ends and mine begins. The work of the mind, sadly undervalued in Skyrim."
"My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me."
"My... associate will be pleased at your resourcefulness. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me."
"What are you in for, new blood?"
"Innocent? So was I, for the first one. The other murders were all me, though."
"Petty thieving, huh? Just like poor Grisvar. Hopefully you'll learn your lesson faster than he has."
"Violent one, huh? Best keep that to yourself, new blood. Others find out, they'll consider that a challenge."
"I hear you're in for life. Sad. I'd get a shiv if I was you, or maybe some Skooma to drown your troubles."
My advice? Serve your time at the pickaxe and get out. You don't want to end up getting a shiv in the guts over a bottle of Skooma.
"They come in here once a week to clean out the bodies, grab any ore we've mined, and beat down the troublemakers."
"That's the only time when we get food, too. And if there's not enough ore mined up, we don't get any."
"A Nord nobleman I served was stabbed in the night. Wasn't me, but I knew I'd be blamed."
So I ran. Joined the Forsworn. Started killing. Got caught. Now I'm here.
Because life was better under the old ways. No Nords and their laws.
"One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in your kinsmen's blood. Best you not be there on that day, Nord."
"One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in their blood."
"Small blade. Easy to hide. I mean, sure, you could just swing a pickaxe into someone's face, but people tend to see that coming."
"Got a problem with a prisoner? Get a shiv. Hear Grisvar has a spare, if you could get him to part with it."
"Ah, you want protection? I can get you what you need."
"Maybe you can do something for me, first? Duach has a bottle of Skooma. Finest distilled Moon Sugar. I'm shaking just thinking about it."
"Ah, you're a clever one aren't you? Now, here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?"
"Thank you, friend. Don't worry. I'll have that shiv ready for you."
"All right, but if you change your mind. Not like we're going anywhere."
"You give me one more look, and I cut you open. That Skooma's mine."
"Getting the shakes, huh? All right. Take it. Old gods keep you."
Skooma addict. Get lost.
Easy there. I didn't mean nothing. Take it.
That's it.
Smart.
"Here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?"
"Every blade I make honors Malacath. Every rivet, every plate of armor is for him."
Only a true Orc knows how to temper Orichalcum properly.
The old traditions are passed down from one generation to the next. The secrets of smithing are passed down as well.
"Lob will one day take my place, and bring honor to our tribe as I have."
I learn much from Garakh every day. I must learn if I am to take her place.
I've worked with metal long enough that I almost never burn myself anymore.
"My weapons will someday be as strong as my mother's, and Malacath will be pleased with me."
The days of staying within Largashbur's walls are over.
Malacath demands much of us now. We will not fail him again.
"Gularzob has been chosen as chief. He will one day be great, but he has much to learn."
Largashbur will not soon forget what you have done. We have a second chance thanks to you.
"The ways of the mystic are known to me. I have remedies and cures, should you need them."
It is good to finally know that Malacath has not forsaken us.
"We have learned from our mistakes. Malacath's needs come first, and we will serve him faithfully."
"I will do my best to lead the tribe, but I don't know why Malacath chose me."
I am honored to have been chosen to lead. But I know that being picked by Malacath does not mean that I am ready.
"Yamarz betrayed us all. I will never allow that to happen again, so long as I rule."
"Do not raise arms against my people, and you shall always have a place here, Champion of Malacath."
"Atub is wise beyond her years. I take her advice seriously, and you should as well."
I am... surprised that Gularzob was named chief.
"We are all blood here. One family, one tribe."
"I will serve Gularzob as best I can, even though I am his elder."
"These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I."
"To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate."
"I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Daedra to retrieve one for us."
"You will summon a Dremora, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you."
"I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event."
"Once you have summoned the Dremora, you will order it to deliver to you a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate."
"Once I have the sigil stone, I shall inscribe the spells that you seek."
If only that were true.
Because I have no wish to be harmed.
Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding.
You must first prove you are in control.
Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.
I serve no mortal!
"You control nothing, mortal!"
"Do it, Listener. Kill me."
You have no choice. You must complete your contract. You must kill me.
"Please, Listener. Release my soul, and let Sithis be the judge."
"Please step back, there's an execution in process."
Last warning. Stand back from the execution.
"Ask any fool around here, and get a different answer."
Mercenaries. Warriors of honor. Brothers and sisters of the blade. Drunken rabble. Take your pick.
I've been here longer than most of them. Even I don't know sometimes. I just hope they don't kill each other.
The Companions are my family. We fight so that other people don't have to.
We bring honor and glory to ourselves and each other.
You'll hear some of the brighter faces around here talk about honor and glory.
"I've got nothing against it, but for me, the promise of coin is what feeds my blade."
"Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden."
"Your question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering."
The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge.
I try to hold us to the right path.
Why would you even come to Jorrvaskr without knowing what we stand for?
"This is not play-acting, here. We are the true spirit of Skyrim. Honor is in our blood, death in our hearts."
"If you seek either, you've found the right place."
Are you looking to join? I wouldn't get your hopes up.
"The short answer is: we fight. The long answer is... eh, forget it. You're not worth my time."
Only the most famous warrior band in all of Skyrim. Have you been living with the horkers?
"When we arrive, blood is spilled and our blades sing to the glories of Ysgramor."
"We're the best damned fighters in Skyrim. At least, some of us are."
They used to be something. Nowadays they just squabble amongst themselves.
Take my advice and keep away. You look too smart to get caught up with this bunch.
"To hear Vignar tell it, they're a bunch of layabouts and useless whiners who used to know how to fight."
"But he thinks everything used to be better. I, for one, would trust any Companion with my life."
"A good bunch of men and women, who make too much a mess, if you ask me."
"An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions?"
An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor.
And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.
"This is life, brother. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath."
"This is life, sister. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath."
"Politics are something best avoided. I prefer more personal confrontations, myself."
None of our business. There's no honor to be had in the squabbling of jarls.
Kodlak says not to worry about it. I worry that a bunch of snowberries are out there earning glory while we stay out of it.
But I'll follow the old man's lead. As ever.
"Too confusing for me. Empire, Nords, Talos. Who cares?"
Just tell me who needs bludgeoning.
There are always good reasons to fight. I just wish this war had them.
Who cares who worships what dead god? Give me something to make me draw my sword.
"Soon enough, it'll be me. In the meanwhile, the Circle handles our daily routine, and Kodlak advises them as Harbinger."
You don't just waddle in here and get to speak to the boss. Who do you think you are?
"If you want to embarrass yourself, I won't stop you. Kodlak is the Harbinger. He's the closest thing you'll find to a leader around here."
The Circle are the ones who parcel out the jobs.
"That's Aela, Skjor, and the brothers, Farkas and Vilkas."
"Kodlak advises them, but he doesn't really give orders."
"In charge of what? I'm in charge of me, and you're in charge of you."
"If you're looking to join up, Kodlak's the one to be talking to."
I learned the ways of the blade in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City.
I came home to Skyrim when it was all over. But I wasn't much good at anything other than fighting.
"Wandered around as a blade for hire. Was a damned good one, too."
"The money was good, and the women were good, and the drinks were good. But I was losing myself. My heart."
I was lucky the Companions found me. Now there's a reason to be fighting. The honor of my brothers and sisters is worth more than coin.
"Of course, the money is still good. And the drinks!"
"My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade."
I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt.
Good training.
"Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my Shield-Sisters through time."
Vilkas and I have been here since we were little whelps.
"Our father, Jergen, raised us here."
Even Vignar couldn't remember Companions younger than us!
"To hear Farkas tell it, our father raised us here as happy pups, running around biting knees."
"I love my brother, but his brains are not his strong suit."
"We were brought here by Jergen. Whether he was our father or not, I don't care."
He left to fight in the Great War and never came back. So he's not my problem anymore.
"We've been here as long as either of us can remember, though. So try to show some respect."
"Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own."
"I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe."
"I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit."
"My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there."
"He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home."
"I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings."
"Fortune and glory, friend. Fortune and glory."
So I wouldn't have to answer stupid questions from idiots.
Are you kidding? I've wanted to be with them since I was a little girl.
Haven't you heard the stories of Kodlak and Skjor fighting off the hundred-and-one Orc berserkers?
"Skjor says it was more like forty, but he's just being modest."
"Where else would I want to be but here? Learning from them, fighting at their sides."
"A man of my station has many debts. I'm not much use at labor or learning, but I can throw a punch with the best of 'em."
"The Companions let me fight for gold, and so I fight."
"When you get to be my age, you don't remember why you did much of anything."
Only that it happened.
"Oh, I'm not a Companion, myself. I just help Vignar. He took me in when I was having a tough time, and... well, I owe him."
"Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, boy."
"Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, girl."
"How did you... you reach beyond your station, new blood. Let's wait and see how we judge your Trial before speaking further."
"You shouldn't even know about that. Remember you're not a full Companion yet, whelp. Know your place."
What did I tell you? Keep quiet about that.
"I think there are some things that... oh, wait. Are you trying to trick me? You are not a full-blood yet. We can't talk about that."
We should not be talking about that.
"I don't know what you're talking about. But if I were you, I'd hold my tongue."
"I don't know who you've been talking to, but they were clearly mistaken."
"Especially for a new whelp, you should choose your words more carefully."
"For me, a heavy burden."
"The beastblood has given me prowess, but my soul is now forfeit to Hircine upon my death."
"I keep searching for some hope of Sovngarde, but to no avail."
A sensitive question. You may want to be careful broaching that subject with some.
"The old man and I have our differences when it comes to this. It's a blessing, given by Hircine."
To worry about the hereafter means losing sight of the now.
"What do I care about Sovngarde? Give me the power to tear my foes as a beast of the wild, and I will savor it."
"I was raised in the woods. Hunting every animal I could see, with my father. I know them all as well as I know my own mind."
And when I feel myself filling with the blood of the wolf... it's like I'm bringing all the strength of all the beasts inside me.
But my mind and soul remain my own. I become more than either human or beast.
It's like being born. Every time.
I've enjoyed the boons that come with beastblood. Just like every member of the Circle.
"Kodlak is right, though. We've given a piece of our souls for this power. I know my mythic histories. Bargains like that lead to ruin."
This is a curse that was laid upon us. That much is clear.
"I like being stronger when I become the wolf. But Kodlak says it is bad for the soul, and I trust him."
It means living such that your Shield-Siblings would proudly say they fought at your side.
"Glory in battle, honor in life."
Deal with problems head on. Leave whispers and sneaking to the gutter rats who can't fight for themselves.
I wish more of our ranks asked such questions.
I've started seeing the Companions as a kind of family.
"I've battled next to every man and woman here, and the bonds of sweat are stronger than those of blood."
"I would trust anyone here with my life, which is more than I'd say for the milk drinkers who raised me."
"It means resting your haunches in Whiterun more than I'd care to, for one."
"But when it's time to draw blood, there's no one in Skyrim I'd rather have at my back."
"It means waking up every day knowing that you could die, and having to earn your life by clawing for every breath."
I don't know how those cozy lords manage to drag themselves out of bed every day. Why bother if you're not living?
I've never been a smart one. But the Companions welcome anyone with the heart of a warrior.
"When we step into battle, we fight for our own name, and the name of the Companions."
There's been a group called the Companions for over 4000 years. It's been many different things in that time.
A conquering army. Ruthless mercenaries. A band of drunken louts. And the esteemed company you see before you.
But there's always been a kind of honor to it. We don't deal in politics or underhanded sneaking.
"We try to uphold the legacy of Ysgramor. To bear his good name such that it never be forgotten, and always be spoken with reverence."
"It means signing on for the Nord ideas of how to live your life. Honor, battle, glory, all that."
"[QUOTE]Even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord,[QUOTE] Skjor said when I joined. I think he meant it as a compliment."
"To me, it means not having to answer foolish questions a second time."
"Just because you've been accepted here so quickly, don't think I'm going to help you rise any faster."
"Fight well, don't be a lout, and you'll be fine. You don't need my help."
So much.
This group... this family... this band... this is the best thing I've ever been a part of.
"The oldest fighting group in Skyrim, and nothing but glory from Ysgramor's day to our own."
"To be counted in that line is a bit of immortality. Even if I never see Sovngarde, I'll have that much."
"It means when I have troubles, I always have someone on my side."
We have Shield-Siblings to keep our backs as dangerous as our fronts.
I think.
My advice? Don't overthink it. Fight well and the rest takes care of itself.
"Mostly food supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time."
"The Greybeards tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning."
"Well, it's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food."
"Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll."
Really? That would be kind of you.
"Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done."
Maybe I'll hold off and go another day. Get some rest first.
"Quite a climb, wasn't it?"
"Anyway, much appreciated. Here, take this for your troubles."
"Well, there's the occasional wolf pack or stray, but that's all I've ever had to deal with. Shouldn't be a problem for the likes of you."
"Other than that, watch your footing. In these wintry conditions, the stairs can be treacherous."
Keep your eyes open in the barrow... that's how they get you!
"If you're headed up to the monastery, watch your step... it's a long way down."
"If you pass through again, stop by for a drink."
"A pleasant journey, milord."
"A pleasant journey, milady."
Just get out of town as fast as you can. Nothing for anyone here.
"Sure, leave. Everyone else does."
I wish I could go with you...
Narfi so happy! So happy! So happy!
The mountain will eat you! Watch the mountain!
"If you see Reyda, tell her that Narfi misses her and to come home soon... very soon. Soon... soon, like the moon!"
Reyda! Reyyyyda!
Hmph. What a boring conversation.
Thanks again for the legwork.
Be careful up there.
"Welp, time to gather more supplies I guess."
"If you get a chance, kill a few more bears for me, will you?"
Now go give those stupid bears what's coming to them!
"Just get out of my way, I've got work to do."
Have yourself a great day!
"Nah, not so much. The odd traveler on the road. But mostly just old Fultheim, come to drink away a lifetime of bad memories, I'd wager."
"Course there's the Orc. Long-term tenant, that one. For what he pays, I could afford to shut this place down."
"This old place? Been here forever. Built by my great grandda. Run by him, then all the way up the line to me."
"Him? Oh... Ah, name's Balablob or Malaclob, one of them funny Orc names. Talks real good, though. Not a savage at all."
"Said he's a writer. Don't know what kind of job that is, but it must earn him some pretty coin. He's paid up for the next few months."
"He mostly just hangs about. Goes down to the lake, sometimes samples the stores of wine in the cellar. Man can do whatever he pleases, far as I care."
"Anything you need, just holler."
"Sure, walk away. I wasn't talking or anything..."
You see any other inns around here? Where else would I go to drink?
"Well he don't like company, I can tell you that much. Just wants to be left alone. But no... that's not really it."
"It's like... he wants to talk. Likes people and all. But he stays separate, because he's supposed to."
"Kind of sad, really."
No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him?
Well? Out with it.
We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
Ah yes. I've studied those documents... Very interesting...
"Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that."
We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
Ah yes.
I suppose it's time I gave him an answer...
"Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants."
"For now, give the papers to my Steward."
I see... Give the papers to my Steward.
"But until that dragon's dealt with, Ulfric's just going to have to wait."
"For now, I'll hold onto this axe. But it's a tenuous peace at best."
I suppose it's time I give him an answer...
Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes.
"Just give me the letter. I presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good."
"Now, I believe you have some business to conclude with my court wizard?"
Now get out of here and to the outpost! I need to know what's happening out there.
Hmm... these are interesting reports...
"Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun..."
"As in all things, Lord, caution... I urge us to wait and see."
Prey waits.
I'm of a mind with Irileth.
You plan to march on Windhelm?
"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or to declare his intentions."
"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates."
It's time to act.
He'll do no such thing!
He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!
He was rather straight forward with Torygg.
Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!
That [QUOTE]boy[QUOTE] was High King of Skyrim.
"I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy."
"If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the old way, let him."
Though I suspect he'll prefer to send his [QUOTE]Stormcloaks[QUOTE] to do it for him.
True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's.
"Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric..."
Ulfric is the one who has offended.
"But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire."
And what harm is there in letting a few legionnaires die in place of your own men?
It seems cowardly.
Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?
This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No.
The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.
This again?! That was different. Was Balgruuf given a chance to object? No. The Jarls weren't asked. He was told. And he had to like it.
The chests of gold didn't hurt.
Damnit! This isn't about gold!
"Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious."
"Oh, he's serious. But so am I."
Finally.
You there.
"I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the esteemed Jarl of Windhelm."
So about this axe...
One moment. But don't go far. I expect I'll need you.
"I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm sending you to Windhelm."
Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.
You can return this axe to our friend. The esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.
How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe.
"If he returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps it, then we are at peace."
Men who understand one another need not waste words.
There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
Ulfric will know my meaning.
Good.
Good...
Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.
"Are we writing a letter, Lord?"
"Yes, to General Tullius."
I need to make a few things clear before I accept these Legionnaires of his.
It's time to decide.
Is that so? I've been wondering when he'd come around.
Then I was wrong about him.
Oh. What's this?
Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity you've chosen the wrong side...
You can return this axe to the man who sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain... visitors.
I expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near future...
Sooner than you think.
"I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk, it makes us weak."
I must now show them the path that will lead us back to our strength.
There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat without threshing the chaff.
The Empire and the Jarls who back them must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.
"Oh? True, I may meet my end in a dark alley with a dagger in my back. But the people have seen the truth, and they will not back down."
You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response.
"As soon as you left I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here."
Let Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces.
I'll turn you back over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be with us all.
Very funny. Did Enthir put you up to this?
You... Really? An Elder Scroll?
Wait. Are you... Are you serious?
You have an Elder Scroll? You?
I would be honored. Beyond honored to have such a thing here at the College.
"This opens up entire new realms of research for us. Oh, if only Septimus were here to see this!"
"Thank you. Please, take this. It can't quite compare to an Elder Scroll, but still. You will be remembered for generations for this."
We have been on our own for some time now. I fear we will not survive.
"You do not know of Malacath? He is the keeper of oaths, the master of curses."
"You are an Orc, but do not know of Malacath, our master and yours?"
"He is quick to anger, and slow to forgive. One who wrongs Malacath is one who will endure great torment in return."
"He demands loyalty and strength from his orcs. We have tried to please him, but he is now angry with us, and so we suffer."
Weeks? Longer? It feels like an age has gone by. I haven't slept in so long.
Malacath has heard my pleas! He speaks to us!
There ain't much more to tell... they're haunted and you should stay away.
"Look, I've seen one of the spirits with my very own eyes. When it glared at me, I swear it burned right through my soul."
"Fortunately, they seem to be sticking to the barrow. I think they're guarding it."
Certainly isn't helping my business any; who'd want to rent a room anywhere near a haunted barrow?
"If you think there's anything you can do, be my guest."
Don't blame you one bit.
"About a year or two ago, some fella named Wyndelius came through; said he was some kind of a treasure hunter."
"I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it."
We never saw him again.
Let me see that!
...I can't believe this...
It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.
Let me see that!
...I can't believe this...
It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.
"Well, least I can do is give you something for taking care of him. If you won't accept it as a payment, consider it a gift."
"Reyda was here, then gone. Went to gather plants and never came home... nope, nope."
Everyone looked and no one could find her. Wilhelm said she'll be back... told Narfi not to worry... Reyda will come back.
With father I said goodbye... with mother I said goodbye. Reyda leaves and Narfi can't say goodbye.
"Makes Narfi very, very sad. Narfi needs Reyda to say goodbye."
He's harmless. He's been in a state ever since his sister Reyda disappeared over a year ago.
He just keeps to himself in what's left of his folk's farmhouse across the river.
I just said that to make the poor guy feel better. I'm pretty sure she's dead.
"Reyda would gather ingredients from the small island in the river east of here. Then one day, she just vanished."
"I tried to look for her, but she never turned up."
"I've seen some sort of a cave entrance over there. Folks call it [QUOTE]Geirmund's Hall,[QUOTE] but I don't know why."
Probably best if you avoid it for now... it didn't seem to do Reyda any good.
Reyda! You saw Reyda? Did you tell her Narfi cries? Did you tell her Narfi never said goodbye like mother and father?
Reyda! You saw Reyda? Did you tell her Narfi cries? Did you tell her Narfi never said goodbye like mother and father?
"Oh no! No, no, no. Narfi never got to say goodbye! Now Narfi's all alone."
At least Narfi has Reyda's Necklace... reminds Narfi of his sister. Thank you for giving this to Narfi.
You've made Narfi so happy! Narfi now waits for his sister until she comes home.
At least Narfi has Reyda's Necklace... reminds Narfi of his sister. Thank you for giving this to Narfi.
Are you kidding? Those damn things will drive me right out of business!
Tell you what. Bring me ten of their pelts from anywhere in Skyrim I'll gladly pay you for thinning out the herd.
Nice to finally meet someone who can follow simple instructions.
"Here's your reward, as promised. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work."
Have you ever seen what a bear does to the trees? They jump up on their hind legs and scratch them to bits... marking their territory or something.
It's getting to the point where I have to scour Skyrim for untouched trees at the right size. Costs me too much time and money.
This is how the Empire repays us for our loyalty?
"By Talos, the stones on this one! You're in no position to dictate terms to us, Tullius!"
"Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it."
"Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to..."
"Yes, my lord."
"Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin."
I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...
No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation?
Your chief Talos-hunter?
That didn't take long.
"Hear, hear!"
Yes!
Diplomatic as usual.
I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.
She's part of the Imperial delegation. You can't dictate who I bring to this council.
"Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere."
Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter.
"You are weak. Sooner you realize it, the sooner we can see the back of you."
"Peace, Galmar."
"Hmm? Oh, sorry. My mind wanders sometimes. I was just thinking about Finn's Lute."
"Over a year ago, thieves broke into the college and made off with a lot of valuable things. Mostly gold and silver."
"But they also stole Finn's Lute. We just learned where the bandits fled to, and I very much want that lute back."
Finn was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today.
"Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes."
The lute they stole is Finn's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.
It makes me sad whenever I think about it.
What? You did? Oh sweet Divines! You did!
There is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years.
That damn fool! I should ring her neck!
Larina. That fool student of mine stole my flute and sold it to some necromancer.
I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for seventeen generations!
Well don't just stand there. Go get my flute!
That's it! Wonderful! I knew I could count on you.
I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for the Winterhold wizards.
Apparently Larina told him some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance.
"It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute."
They found it! They actually found it!
"Rjorn's drum! Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be."
"Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there."
Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum.
"You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least."
That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact.
Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. That was the missing clue.
At last! I have searched for this drum for 20 years.
The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.
"Bandits harass the caravans at every step, but Khajiit usually scare them off."
"A few days ago, we were ambushed. A nuisance, really, but many of the marauders had quick fingers."
"One of them stole my Moon Amulet, given to me by my mother when I was just a cub. It is my only memory of home in this cold land."
You are kind to offer. We believe the bandits are a part of a group headquartered here.
"Be careful. I miss my amulet, but a life cannot be replaced as easily."
We are used to the cycle of gain and loss. It is no trouble.
There it is. Ah.... Home....
"If you ever need the skills of a Khajiit warrior by your side, I would be honored to travel with you."
"Until then, here. This is for you, in thanks."

Now you die!
You should never have come here!
Excellent.
He's Solitude's priest of Arkay. He's the one who figured out Potema was still around. He'll help as much as he can.
I'm not really sure. Styrr thinks you have some sort of link to Potema.
I trust his judgment on this. As a priest of Arkay he's had to deal with necromancy before. Nothing as dangerous as Potema though.
Good luck. I'm counting on you.
Taking on Potema won't be easy. But you are the one to do it.
"Oh, I thought that matter was handled. I think Falk is taking care of that."
Please don't interrupt the court.
Court is in session.
I'm trying to speak to the Jarl.
Not really. Varnius Junius is a fool. I'm sure nothing will come of it.
I suppose if you're truly interested you could talk to Falk. He's the better-safe-than-sorry type.
"I've done my part, Dragon Bridge will have extra guards. Falk Firebeard will find a way to take care of the cave."
"Steal anything from my shop, and you'll regret it."
"Be seein' you, stranger."
"You hear any juicy gossip in town, be sure to share it with me!"
I'll be right here if you need anything else.
See me at my forge if you need arms or armor.
Good steel's worth every septim. Remember that.
"Life is far too short, my friend. Don't waste it!"
We'll all meet Arkay sooner or later. Best to enjoy the time we've got.
Good to talk to you.
You'll meet a lot of tongue-wagging gossips in this town. Try not to take them too seriously.
Mind what you say! The Empire has ears all over this town.
"Mark my words, I'll be Jarl again someday!"
May wisdom forever light your path.
"Be safe, traveler."
"Don't judge Dengeir too harshly. He is old, but he means well."
May your time in Falkreath be pleasant.
Come and see me again sometime. I might have some use for you.
"We're done here, I think."
Keep in song in your heart to ward off the gloom.
"Perhaps one day, I'll write a song about you!"
"Oh, merciful Arkay, no! I am too old and frail, and this graveyard is too large."
"Kust is my assistant. He helps me tend the headstones and keep our cemetery clean, as befits a place of rest."
"Yes, and I couldn't tell you why."
"My wife and I think there's some dark magic at work. Or perhaps Arkay's influence is strong here, and he likes to keep it this way."
The cemetery is ancient. It's been here longer than the town.
"I'm no scholar, but I know that a lot of battles have been fought here over the course of history."
"After each battle, more dead were buried, and the graveyard got bigger. I've heard it's now the biggest graveyard in Skyrim."
Call upon me if I can be of any service.
"Browse as much as you like, please."
"Look around all you want, but don't try anything funny."
Hey! You planning to steal something? Don't even think about it.
"Before we get down to business, I've got something I need you to do."
"Well, as you know, the Guild's growing and things are looking up around here."
The only thing we're lacking is a reliable way to transport our merchandise across Skyrim.
"I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there are several Khajiit Caravans that travel across the realm."
"They're shrewd traders and don't mind getting their hands dirty. I've bartered with their leader, Ri'saad, on more than one occasion."
"Actually, I want you to bring him something. You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances."
"Present Ri'saad with this satchel of Moon Sugar, and I bet my last septim he'll make a deal."
It's an illegal substance highly favored by the Khajiit. Very difficult to come by.
"If Moon Sugar is refined properly, it can be used to make skooma, another substance that will knock you over after a single draught."
Ri'saad is the head of a small syndicate of independent merchant families.
"Each caravan is obliged to pay dues, but in return a small portion of the profits are shared between them and the leader parcels out the routes."
"If we could make contact with them, they could provide an excellent way to inconspicuously transport goods for us."
"You approach as if you know us, stranger. Who are you and what do you want?"
"Yes, I've heard the Guild is rising back to power. An alliance would be most beneficial to both parties."
"I'll consider the offer, but I'll have to discuss it with the other caravans."
"Ah, Moon Sugar. I could smell it on you. I'm pleased with this offer, and accept."
Take my word to the leaders of your guild and tell them we look forward to a prosperous and profitable future.
"If you happen upon any of our caravans in your travels, we'd also be more than willing to pay you a fair sum for any of your stolen goods."
"Good, I'll contact some of my people and have them prepare some shipments right away."
"Good job. Here, let me give you something for all the leg work."
"Was there anything else, or is our transaction complete?"
Did Ri'saad accept our offer?
Give my regards to Tonilia. Tell her I'll contact her soon.
You'll find Ri'saad with his caravan group. Just don't do anything stupid when you get there.
"Quickly, follow me!"
But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age.
Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?
"The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me!"
We should get after Vals Veran before he does more damage here.
I'll tell you more about it when we are nearby.
"It's somewhere around here, Agna said to look to the Bear to find the way."
Thanks again for your help.
"I have things I should see to, but go ahead."
I feel better already.
"Gods bless you, healer."
Thank you. The pain is already easing.
"The fever's down a bit, an' I can almost see straight."
"I still can't hold nothin' down, but it's better than yesterday."
"My joints ache, I can't eat nothin' and my head feels like a furnace. I've seen better days."
"The pain's a little less than before, but it still hurts bad enough."
"It's not as bad as before, but I still can't get a good night's sleep."
"I ain't going to lie, it's still pretty bad."
Let's go.
Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.
What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?
You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text.
"Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts."
Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.
"Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research."
"Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable..."
"Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back."
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.
Farengar!
"Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby."
"You should come, too."
A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?
I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it.
"So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?"
Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.
"Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution."
I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.
No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.
As you command.
Hey!
Get me out of here!
Hurry!
The guard has the key.
Thanks!
Let's teach these bastards a lesson.
All right!
Last but not least. Let's go!
"Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and she deserves better."
Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.
"If trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becomes a burden, and you find yourself in Winterhold, visit me at the College."
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.
"If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me."
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.
Crossing the Guild was a bad idea. I'll buy goods from you after you settle your accounts.
"Ah, you're just in time. I got in a shipment of fine wares courtesy of the East Empire Company."
"Come to sell me something special, or did you just want to look through my merchandise?"
"Ah, you're back. I'm hearing good things about the Guild through the grapevine."
Brought me more than some Firebrand Wine I trust?
"I heard about what you did at the Guild all the way out here. Sorry, can't buy or sell anything from you."
Been a while since I've seen you at the meadery. Bring me anything interesting?
What brings you to Whiterun? Got some juicy goods to sell?
What have you got for me today? Nothing illegal I hope!
I've got plenty of good merchandise for you. Take a look.
"Rumor has it you couldn't follow the Guild's rules, so we can't do any business until it's been worked out."
"Taking me up on my offer, eh? Good."
"I'm assuming you're here for more than a social call. Down to business, eh?"
"I'm always on the lookout for all sorts of goods. Bring me whatever you... well, [QUOTE]find[QUOTE] and I'll see what I can do."
"So, did Delvin send you again or you here on your own this time?"
"In trouble with the Guild, eh? Well, looks like we won't be trading merchandise until you smooth it over."
"So, you've come to see me to sell or to buy? Hm?"
"I've got all sorts of interesting things for you to buy, and I assure you they're of the finest quality."
"If you've got the time to sell, I've got the time to buy."
Let's see what you have for me today. Something simple to turn around for a profit I trust.
I've been forbidden to deal with you until amends are made with the Guild. Sorry.
"Glad your here, I've been looking for some more merchandise to buy. Have lots of orders to fill and my clients don't like to wait."
Now I know you've come by for more than just a visit. What did you bring?
"I promise you, I buy much more than simple silver trinkets."
"I've made a lot of new contacts thanks to you, and more contacts means more coin for everyone."
Just remember me if you get your hands on anything else.
"Do me a favor. If you speak to Maven, tell her everything's well at hand down here, okay?"
Give my regards to Karliah if you see her.
Hurry back... and bring more merchandise.
"When you get back to Riften, tell Delvin this new arrangement's working out quite well."
"Working with the Guild again is the best decision I've ever made. Protection, respect and a constant flow of coin... it couldn't get any better."
"Best of all, there's no need to smuggle things quietly anymore. With the influence we have in Solitude, I can march it right out the front door."
How could I complain when I went from Sabjorn's lackey to one of the wealthiest merchants in Whiterun in no time at all?
"Plus, the meadery's doing so well, I'm almost having trouble keeping up with the demand."
I'd say things couldn't be any better.
Business? Business is actually inconsequential to me. I share little of your lust for coin.
"However, as promised, I'll still be more than happy to take any stolen merchandise off your hands."
"I've been setting up some open trading with Tonilia back at the Guild in Riften, and it's proven to be quite profitable."
"There's been no word from the remnants of the Summerset Shadows, so I'm assuming you either eliminated all of them or they've fled Skyrim."
"Everything seems to be working out nicely, wouldn't you agree?"
"Business is absolutely booming, my friend."
I've taken to hiring a few extra men of my own just to keep up with all the shipments.
"Old Delvin certainly takes care of his own, doesn't he."
"We found a cave under the lake. With luck, it'll lead into the prison."
"I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard."
We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.
Should be fun.
There's a grate outside the wall. Looks like it used to be buried in snow. I don't think they know it's there.
"From the look of it, I'd bet it leads straight into the prison."
"I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard."
We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.
You should wait until night fall before trying to sneak in. Talos preserve you.
Talos preserve you.
I have faith in you.
"But, if you find more trouble than you can handle, run out to the courtyard. We'll come as soon as we hear fighting."
"Guard! My fine's been paid, now set me free!"
"Sorry, my ears aren't so good. You say somethin'?"
I said my fine has been paid! Now let me out!
"Right, right... Oh, look at that. I seem to have lost my keys. Might take me a while to find them."
You just sit tight. I'll get around to it eventually.
Curse you!
Some of these Nords will come up with any excuse to despise us.
And it isn't just the dark elves they hate -- they make a target of the Argonians as well.
"In fact, just about anyone who isn't a Nord is fair game for their bullying."
"You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for."
"Let's see. Ah, so that's what happened to Staubin. Tragic, but I warned him he was leading those people on a fool's errand."
"Unfortunately, sometimes the stone of scholarship is built on the foundation of death. I'll inform the kin."
"Here, I usually pay researchers for their work when they emerge from the ruins, but they won't be needing it anymore."
"Oh really? Hmm... this looks like someone from Staubin's little group. A brave scholar, but not very wise...."
"If you find Staubin, it would be good to see any notes he may have collected. I doubt you'll find him alive, though."
"So, are you working with them? You think you can take me? You so much as touch me, and you're going to lose fingers."
I mean it! I'll... I'll cut you in half!
"I'm sorry, just... Just don't hurt me. I know you're not one of them, but you just can't help them. You can't let them know I'm here."
"Please, will you help me? There's no one here I can trust."
"Turns out, we fatally underestimated the Thalmor. They smashed us with ease during the Great War."
"I was one of the few who escaped. For a long time, all I cared about was staying alive, and taking revenge on the Thalmor when I could."
But then the dragons returned. And I remembered that the Blades used to be dragonslayers.
"And that we were sworn to protect the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer of all."
You were given this gift by the gods for a reason. It is up to you to figure out how best to use it.
May your road lead you to warm sands.
I hope that you will come to do business with us again.
May the sun keep you warm even in this land of bitter cold.
"Until our next meeting, if such is fated."
I hope you will find a warmer welcome in your travels than we have found in ours.
"The roads of Skyrim can be treacherous. If you must walk them, be wary."
"Tools, wares and weapons, all for sale at fair prices."
"Goods and wares of all kinds, and all can be yours!"
Come! Come and see what goods I offer.
Far have I traveled to bring you these fine goods. Come and see what I offer.
"The Khajiit hail from a distant land called Elsweyr, bordered on the north by Cyrodiil and the south by the glistening blue waters of the sea."
"Elsweyr is an arid land of deserts and rocky canyons, where the sun shines warmly, always."
"There are cities so ancient, the sands have swallowed them whole. But now I will say no more, for I miss my home greatly."
"An astute question, for we are far from home and this is a cold, hard land."
"The wise trader finds the best opportunities, even if he must travel far to find them. Skyrim is a ripe opportunity indeed."
"The dragons and the war have scared many other traders away, but for those with courage, there is much profit to be made."
"Mostly it is the Nords. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities."
"When they look upon us, they see only pickpockets and skooma dealers. It is most unfair, but we do our best to ignore them."
"Not long, in truth. I came to Skyrim after I found myself unwelcome in both Elsweyr and Cyrodiil."
I seem to have an unfortunate talent for getting myself involved in misunderstandings with the law.
"Ri'saad was able to look past that, and it was he who helped to set me up with a trade caravan. Now I work for him."
"He hired the others and paid for my goods. I am allowed to run the caravan, but I pay Ri'saad a percentage of my profits."
"I say this without bitterness, for it was Ri'saad who saved me from a life of servitude aboard a trading ship."
I am grateful to have the life that I do now. It is a far cry from my days as an orphan on the streets of Corinthe.
It is Ri'saad who owns the three trading caravans that travel the roads of Skyrim.
"Long ago, I was an orphan on the streets of Corinthe. I stowed away aboard a trade ship that brought me here. It was Ri'saad who found me."
"He provided the funds to start this caravan, and put me in charge of it. I owe him more than I could ever hope to repay."
"Quite the opposite, in fact."
"The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means."
"It was Ri'saad's idea to come here now, while the land is in turmoil. Where others saw only danger, he saw opportunity."
Vampire! Burn it!
Vampire! To arms!
Burn it! Burn the vampire!
Vampire!
"Your skin's as pale as the snow. You scared of sunlight, or something?"
Don't like those eyes you got. There's a bad hunger to them.
I wish Elgrim had spent more time tutoring me then that Ingun girl.
"Gunnar, take care of the boy. I have to find General Tullius and join the defense."
"Although it would benefit the Guild more than you can imagine, in the end, it would do more harm than good."
I'm afraid that's impossible.
"Good, then you understand why this is about more than just Mercer's lust for power."
I feel better already.
"Gods bless you, healer."
Thank you. The pain is already easing.
"Here's something to consider, Mirabelle."
"[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], by Dranor Seleth. Old book, one I'd forgotten about. This thing here... it might be what the book was about."
I don't see the relevance.
He proposed that the real reason Saarthal was fought over by the Elves and the Nords was because something was unearthed there.
"Something arcane. Very old, very powerful. Do you think...?"
Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll do all the research we need to figure out what we're dealing with.
"This is your last warning, outsider. We keep the peace, here. Stay out of our business."
"Tell me, do you believe in mighty Arkay, god of life and death?"
"There's one out on the road. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company."
It's a smart man that demands something up front for his work. Some gold now and some when I have my dog. Here's the meat.
"Ha! You've done it! Got to admit, I wasn't sure you could pull it off. But you've definitely earned your pay."
Let's make the exchange.
I see you but I don't see Frost. Come back when you have the horse with you.
"Yes, yes. Here it is. I think I'd best be off now."





People say there's a man wandering the streets near the Blue Palace. He seems distressed but he's not making any sense.
Varnius Junius stopped by here on his way to court. He was worried about something. I'm sure Falk Firebeard could tell you what.
"I think the Bards College might be looking for recruits. You should speak to the head of the college, Viarmo, if you're interested."
"Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much."
Done. Convince him to stay out of the city while you're at it.
Takes coin to pay a fine. And you don't have enough.
What was that?
There it is again. Did you hear that?
"I said, next prisoner!"
"No! Linwe prefers stealing from the deceased. Digs up the corpses, breaks into the Hall of the Dead..."
He even stole that locket right off that poor murdered girl's body... or what was left of it.
"I'm sorry I mislead you. Return when this is over, and we'll talk about my involvement in the Thieves Guild."
I don't know. Rumor has it that she was murdered... butchered by a madman. I really try and stay out of such things.
"Torsten might think Linwe or myself are responsible for Fjotli's death, but I can assure you nothing could be further from the truth."
I must return to Markarth.
"Yes, can I help you with something?"
Fjotli...  Fjotli... Where have I heard that name?
"Oh, of course, the poor girl who was murdered. Such a beautiful young thing... a tragedy to be certain."
How dare you!
You're accusing me of taking part such a... such a... heinous act? I should have you arrested for even suggesting such a thing!
"Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people."
I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea what you're speaking of.
"Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people."
Now you're threatening me? What in the name of the Divines is wrong with you?
Think I'm defenseless? Well you're wrong!
"Next time you wish to accuse someone of a crime, I suggest you obtain proof!"
"Look, I had no choice. They're crazy... I could be killed!"
"It's a guild of Altmer thieves, they call themselves the Summerset Shadows."
"Their leader, Linwe, he's the worst of the lot. He steals valuables from the dead."
I used to fence for the Thieves Guild in Skyrim a long time ago.
"When Linwe moved into the area, he contacted me and said if I didn't fence for them, he'd kill me."
"If I tell you, you need to promise not to kill me."
I'd prove to be quite an asset to the Thieves Guild... I'm one of the best fences in Skyrim.
"Linwe is holed up at a place called Uttering Hills Cave. He's got his entire Guild there, so be careful."
"After you're done with all this, come back anytime, and I'll make good on my end of the bargain."
What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?
What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?
"Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people."
"I've already told you everything I know, I swear."
You're just in time to say hello to Roggvir.
Wish I could head inside Solitude myself. Wouldn't mind seeing Roggvir get what's coming to him.
"Hmmmm... [QUOTE]Fixed[QUOTE] is such a subjective term. I think [QUOTE]treated[QUOTE] is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face."
"Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor my end of the bargain."
So congratulations! You're free to go!
I... have been known to change my mind. So... go. Really.
Oh... lovely. Now all my dear Pelagius has to worry about are the several hundred legitimate threats...
But you're not out of the woods yet! Get it? Out of the woods?
"Ah, wonderful, wonderful! Why waste all that hatred on yourself when it can so easily be directed at others!"
But someone still has quite a bit to do. Hmmm?
"Ah! Good, good! No more barking at all hours, and chewing up my slippers. You used the hemlock, then? Damned good idea! I..."
"Um... We're not talking about Barbas, are we? Clavicus Vile's... dog? Oohh... awkward."
"Oh! That's right! Pelagius! Yes, yes, now I recall. Well done, well done."
Now keep going.
Mortal? Insufferable.
"Yes, yes, you're entirely brilliant. Conquering madness and all that. Blah blah blah."
But you're not done yet. And you could still die...
"Ah, so now my dear Pelagius can hate himself for being legitimately afraid of things that actually threaten his existence..."
...but only during... the day?
"Honestly, I can't keep up. But by all means, don't stop now."
"Oh, I am so happy for you! My, what a burden to have carried. But you've done it! You've conquered your own inner demons! Bravo!"
Um...
You... didn't mean... yourself. You meant... Pelagius...
"Well! Same congratulations apply! Just, you know, for what you did for the insane emperor."
"Conquering paranoia should be a snap after that ordeal, hmm?"
"The Gildergreen, yes. It's a bit of an eyesore at the moment. More of a problem for the pilgrims than for me, but not many of them around anymore."
"This is the Temple of Kynareth. The Gildergreen, outside, was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun."
"Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches."
"Of course, not as many pilgrims these days."
This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
"Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. They built the temple."
"Of course, not as many pilgrims these days."
A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains.
"Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol."
I've thought about that... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber.
"I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, we could wake up its child."
"But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal."
"If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first."
You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Spriggans.
"It's called [QUOTE]Nettlebane.[QUOTE] The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself."
"Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic."
Your spirit is strong. Kynareth's winds will guide your path.
It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock.
"It's an old tree. Very old. They say it was a seedling when the first men were arriving from Atmora, thousands of years ago."
"The sap is precious. It can restore barren fields or bring life to rocks. I can use it to repair the Gildergreen, so we can worship properly again."
You're right. It's mine.
"I may not live to see this little one grow into a new Gildergreen, but I can be remembered as the woman who planted it."
I thank you. And may Kynareth's soft rains fall before you.
The Eldergleam has blessed us with a sapling.
"You should take it to Whiterun. Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance."
I believe I'll stay here and bask in Eldergleam's warmth a bit longer.
"It was my pleasure, friend. In a way, I envy you getting to carry such a direct sign of Kynareth's graces."
Good luck on your travels. May Kynareth's wind carry only the sweetest scents.
Do vah kiin!
Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you a great deal.
But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?
"I'm sorry, but I can't do it. We'll just have to keep fighting the dragons as best we can."
There must be another way. The risk is too great.
You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops around without attracting a dragon attack.
By all accounts the Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see the sense of a truce under these conditions.
"I'll be the judge of that. Besides, by all reports the Stormcloaks are suffering just as much as we are from these dragon attacks."
True. A pause to consolidate our gains would be useful. And the Empire can afford to look magnanimous in victory.
Ulfric's insurrection has reached its high tide. Soon enough the rebel Jarls will realize what it means to oppose the Empire.
"But, as you say, these negotiations may offer a chance for his supporters to gracefully return to the Imperial fold."
I think you overestimate Ulfric's chances. He's stretched himself too thin.
But... we could use the breathing space to regroup.
They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons.
"My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons."
Has he? I suppose he doesn't want to miss a chance to bluster about the Empire's many crimes.
He's probably hoping I'll refuse so he can blame the Empire for being unreasonable. I think I'll have to disappoint him yet again.
Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the Nords take these things.
"Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true... well, it changes the situation doesn't it?"
Even Tullius may be forced to talk sense in the face of such a threat.
"Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true, we're all doomed anyway."
"And if it isn't true... well, then the fight to free Skyrim goes on. Either way, I don't see the use in talking to the Empire."
"You speak truly, Dragonborn. Sometimes the grubby business of politics clouds my eyes."
"Besides, it will be good to see High Hrothgar again."
I don't need you to teach me how to play high politics in Skyrim.
But... you're right. There's nothing to be gained by refusing the Greybeards' request.
Ulfric Stormcloak. Jarl of Windhelm.
Lokir of Rorikstead.
"I'm not sure. At first they accused me of being a Stormcloak, a secret Talos worshipper..."
"They wanted a confession. To what didn't matter, they simply wanted me to admit to something."
I think they wanted to break me. Use me as a way to get to the rest of the Gray-Mane family.
I gave them no such pleasure.
"Gods, I've lost count of the days. It feels like an age has passed."
"I wish I could believe that I'd have held out forever against their torture, but I can't be so sure."
Now thanks to you I needn't worry anymore.
The pain is so great...
Unghhh... oww...
I can't bear it... make it stop...
So sick... can hardly stand it...
The fever... my body burns...
Ohh... ughh...
Has your fever cooled?
How is the pain? Any better?
Feeling any better?
How do you feel?
How are you feeling?
More rest will do you good.
Patience. The body needs time to mend.
Try to relax. You'll be well soon enough.
"The pain's a little less than before, but it still hurts bad enough."
"It's not as bad as before, but I still can't get a good night's sleep."
"I ain't going to lie, it's still pretty bad."
"The fever's down a bit, an' I can almost see straight."
"I still can't hold nothin' down, but it's better than yesterday."
"My joints ache, I can't eat nothin' and my head feels like a furnace. I've seen better days."
I feel better already.
"Gods bless you, healer."
Thank you. The pain is already easing.
"I see. Well, perhaps you'll take pity on a humble priest who has lost something precious."
"I'm glad to know that, because I need your help. You see, I've lost something precious."
"By Ysmir, are you thick, or just too new to know better?"
"The Companions are the oldest, most honored band of warriors in Skyrim. Whiterun was built around their hall, Jorrvaskr."
Don't reckon they can use you. But stranger things have happened.
"By Ysmir's beard, I ain't one for humor. You know who the Companions are. So quit your asking."
"Great! I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, then you can lead the way."
Whatever I can to put my family here back to rest.
"After that? Probably just stick around here. Saw some good game on my way here, and I'd like to stay close for a while."
"Ah! Oh, by Kyne you startled me. There's a necromancer around here so watch yourself."
Just one more thing the Gray-Manes want to blame on others.
"It's not my fault they turned their backs on the Empire, or their mule of a son raised arms against it."
And yet they want to heap the fault on my family's good name? Bah.
More bad blood between the houses. Fralia is convinced our family is somehow at fault for the loss of her son.
There's no reasoning with these people anymore.
"No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now."
"It's enough for me to know that he's out there somewhere, and not locked up like an animal in a cage."
"No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now."
"It's enough for me to know that they're out there somewhere, and together again."
Haven't you heard it by now?
"He made the mistake of supporting the Stormcloaks, and it cost him. Bitter news for his family, but a fate they should've expected."
Here's the letter. Now leave me out of this.
We've got to find Thorald quickly!
Get to the nearest way out!
I can't believe you came for me!
He must have been very convincing.
I've never known Avulstein to be that convincing! Where is the little scamp?
"I've got a little work if you're interested, traveler."
"You should see me when you get bored, stranger."
The Blackblood Marauders are... very identifiable. I didn't want anyone thinking the Blackbloods were getting too bold.
Deeja and I are more like their representatives here in Solitude. None of the Blackbloods can show themselves without being arrested.
"Th...thank you, my Jarl thank you."
Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?
"Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell Captain Aldis I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge."
"Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave..."
"I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed."
You've done a larger service to the realm than you could possibly know. A resurrected Potema... I shudder at the thought.
Then I have an important task for you.
I need you to break into Mercer's home and search for anything that could tell us where he's gone.
Aye. A gift from the Black-Briars after they kicked the previous family out... place called Riftweald Manor.
"He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place."
"Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you."
"Be careful, lass. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you."
"Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way."
Get on with it.
Stormcloak lover.
Traitor!
Traitor!
Let's be done with it!
You betrayed us!
Some gate guard you were!
It shouldn't have been like this.
I think I expected more.
Good riddance to bad rubbish I say.
He died well.
"Good, Illdi. Soak in the lore. Jorn, what happened during the Red Year?"
"Remember, being a bard isn't just about the music."
Illdi. What year did the Aldmeri Dominion invade the Empire?
Late One-seventy-one.
"Vvardenfell's Red Mountain erupts. Try to be precise, Jorn."
"Ummm, Morrowind suffered a massive explosion..."
Be sure to watch your finger positions. Especially during the transitions.
"Ataf, please play back that piece for me."
Very good. Let's continue with our practice.
"All right, let's try something a bit more... fun."
That was better Ataf. Add a bit of emphasis on [QUOTE]Ragnar[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]Red.[QUOTE]
"Remember, it's your job to [QUOTE]deliver[QUOTE] these songs. To excite the crowd. Draw them in and they will love you for it."
I've got a shipment of Spices the East Empire Company is holding up. I need someone to convince them to release it.
You wouldn't have a few minutes to run down to the docks would you?
Great. Get back to me when you're done and I'll give you something for your time.
Ah well. I'll keep looking for someone. Thanks anyway.
Ah yes. If she wants to pay the two thousand gold tariff than we'll be all set.
You will?
I mean of course you will. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
I suppose I could make an exception. I do like her spiced wine.
"Fine, tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly."
That's not my problem.
That would be acceptable. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
I'm afraid your bargaining without the metal to back it up.
Thank you so much. I swear it's a fight with them every shipment. Here's something for your troubles.
Those who worship at the shrines will sometimes receive boons from the gods themselves.
"The nature of the favors varies per deity. Please, feel free to worship at any or all of the shrines."
"Hmm? Ah, yes. That once held the shrine to Talos. But the worship of Talos was banned by the White-Gold Concordat, some time ago."
It's the peace treaty that ended the war with the Elves of the Aldmeri Dominion.
"The Dominion recognized the heresy of proclaiming Talos a god. Talos was a great man, and a great Emperor... but that does not make him a god."
No matter how much the Stormcloaks may wish it were so.
Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.
"If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip."
Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.
"If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip."
"Go ahead, Ataf."
I believe I've made myself rather clear.
Yes of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision.
"You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here."
"You are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity."
"Yes, of course. The Arch-Mage has my thanks."
Very good. Then we're done here.
Your superior and I were simply having a... discussion about my level of access to the College.
"Well, perhaps that is why you're merely an Apprentice here."
Nothing you need to concern yourself with. I shall be quite capable of observing everything that goes on here.
I still don't see why we had to bring it back here.
The Arch-Mage believed it important. It must be powerful.
"We don't know that. We don't even know what it is. Where is Aren, anyway?"
"In his quarters, with that Thalmor, Ancano. Something urgent, it sounded like."
"All right, that's enough. Let's return to our business please."
"All right, that's enough. Back to bed, please."
"Of course, leave an old man with a ruined dream. Just like everyone else. Fool."
"The Night Mother's crypt in Bravil was... desecrated. The Imperial Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present."
"So Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see."
Such was my... honor. As Keeper.
What? Who is the Night Mother?
"Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with gullible Cicero!"
You of course know that the Night Mother is our Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the children of Sithis.
And killed them. In his honor.
"Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin."
"Hmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror of midnight. Sithis is all those things."
He is... the Void.
Ha ha! Behold the final trick of the Fool of Hearts! You think me near death? Think again!
No. I was just buying jewelry for my sister in Cyrodiil. I've never even seen that man before.
Just visiting. I had some business here. That's all.
"Not much. One moment I was buying a necklace, and the rest is just a blur."
Was is that obvious? Damn. I must be losing my touch.
No. I'm not.
I'm one of General Tullius's agents. I was sent to investigate the Treasury House and the Silver-Blood family.
"They own Cidhna Mine, one of the toughest jails in Skyrim. I was hoping I could buy or steal the deed, but I don't think that's how things work here."
Mark my words. Thonar Silver-Blood was behind that attack in the market. Somehow.
Rather not talk. I have to head back to Cyrodiil soon.
No. I'm telling you. There was no other reason.
Or else what? You'll kill me? I already had to face that today.
Thank you. The Eight keep you.
"So the clues point to the Treasury House, then. That makes sense. Thonar is involved in every facet of the city."
Here's the gold I promised. Keep following the trail and there will be more in it for you.
You. I've seen you snooping around. Asking questions.
Back off. You don't want to know what happens to troublemakers here.
"You've been warned, outsider."
Funny.
You're finding it. That's bad enough.
We'll see.
You've been warned.
You're not one of my workers. What are you doing here?
"Oh, yes. Weylin. Bastard could have at least gone crazy after we made our silver quota."
You hard of hearing? I run this smelter. And I'm late meeting our silver quota. What do you want?
"Well then, look. Look all you want. And when you're done looking, maybe we can get some work done."
"Whatever you want to know, I don't care. I run a smelter. That's it."
Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay. Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
No. I don't.
"For that amount, I can. Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay."
Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
No.
"Hold, on there. I think I just remembered something. The last time we handed out pay."
Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room.
Haven't up until now.
Hmph.
"Every other day, seems one of the laborers runs off in the hills saying he'll join the Forsworn."
You don't like the Nords? Fine. But pledging your whole life to killing them? That's just dumb.
Don't get involved in that nonsense. Just want to work.
"We've lost a lot of good people to that damn crusade. Drive out the Nords, they say. Well, the Nord ain't driven out."
What? No. Thonar Silver-Blood owns it. He owns everything in Markarth.
But he hands all the paperwork over to Nepos the Nose to finish. That old man's back is heavy with burden.
"Me and Hathrasil mostly. Mulush barks at us all day, but I wouldn't call that honest work."
A few people in the Warrens used to work here. Degaine broke some bones a while back. Eltrys quit. Cairine is too sick.
Mulush. Big Orc fella. Can't miss him.
Really should talk to Mulush if you have a problem with one of the workers.
"The Forsworn? That's right. I'll say it. We all knew. Even that fat-headed, slave-driving Mulush knew. Just ask him about it."
Bah. Another honest man lost in all this madness. And for what?
You want Garvey. He handles the keys for the Warrens. About the only thing that disease-riddled native is good for.
"It's where you go if you can't afford a room anywhere else. About the time they opened the mines, someone got the idea to throw beds in here."
Laborers. The sick. The lame. We're all here.
Oh yes. I know everyone who sleeps in the Warrens. Kind of the one who passes the keys around.
"I guess someone else will be taking his room, now."
"Sorry, but you don't exactly belong here."
"Trust is hard to come by here, but all right."
No. It's not. Trust me.
Welcome to the Warrens.
"No, I don't think so."
Now don't get all upset. Here. Take it.
And I wasn't stuttering. No key.
Right.
You've been digging around where you don't belong.
It's time you learned a lesson.
"You again. Guess you need another lesson, huh?"
Nepos is in charge. That's all I know.
Let's go!
Someone who doesn't like you asking questions.
You'll listen to this.
Excuse me. What's your business here?
You again. What are you doing here?
Go on in.
"We haven't been expecting you, and the old man needs his rest. Come back some other time."
"If you must know, I'm the maid. And the master of the house is old and needs his rest."
So if you don't have any business. Leave.
"This is a private home, and the master of the house is a very old man. He's not to be disturbed."
That's what I thought.
"Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send him in."
"Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send her in."
"Hmph. Yes, Nepos."
You heard him. Go on in.
I'm sorry about my housekeeper. She's a little protective of me.
"Now, what is it you want?"
"Because my king told me to. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines."
"I don't know how, but he lives. I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question."
"My king. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines."
"I don't know how, but he lives. I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question."
"A monster? No. I'm just a servant. To my king, Madanach."
"When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines. I don't know how, but he lives."
"I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question."
"My dear boy, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?"
"My dear girl, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?"
You were seen coming in. The girl at the door is a Forsworn agent masquerading as a maid.
You aren't the first one to have gotten this far. You won't be the last.
He is the King in Rags. A man who once held all the Reach within his grip.
He stokes the passions of the downtrodden in this city. Directs them to kill the enemies of the Forsworn in our name.
All from inside Cidhna Mine. A Nord prison. The irony is quite thick.
Markarth and the Reach are our lands. That is why we are the Forsworn. We cannot claim the home that is rightly ours.
"But then during their war with the elves, we had our moment. We drove the Nords out of the Reach in a great uprising."
"Then Ulfric and his men came. Those of us who didn't run were executed, except for myself, my king, and a handful of others."
Nepos the Nose? He's been in Markarth forever. And he's well-respected among the natives of the Reach.
"Good work. Here's your gold. I have a feeling Nepos gets his own orders, though. If you find out, I'll have more for you."
It's an old family. Very well-respected throughout the Reach.
"The Silver-Bloods run nearly all the lands in this Hold, as well as the local inn."
"And of course, they own Cidhna Mine, the finest prison and source of silver in Skyrim."
You want Thonar Silver-Blood. He handles all the family business.
"If you're here to talk politics, though, you'd want his brother Thongvor. He spends most of his time in Understone Keep."
"For one, the landowners of the Reach. It goes without saying that they rely heavily on us for our silver and support."
"All the miners, farmers, and laborers in the Reach get their daily wages through us."
Nepos the Nose handles that part of our business. He has a way with the workers.
I'm afraid he's asked to not be disturbed. He has important business.
"Oh, I'm sorry to keep you. Head right in."
No. He isn't.
Riches are a gate-opener around here. Head right in.
"Private business, I mean. No visitors."
Go... go right ahead then. Don't let me keep you.
I must have misheard you. Did you say you were leaving?
"I doubt he'll be free, but all right."
What are you doing here? I told them no visitors.
The Imperial agent? That's right. I knew. How many dogs is the Empire going to send after me?
This is my business. My city. You Empire lovers should learn to stay out of it.
Now get out.
They're crazy. Think they rule the Reach.
Well guess who really runs things around here? Me. I own the mines. I make the coin pass to the right hands.
That answer your damn questions? Now get out.
What did you expect? That no one was going to notice you butting into business that wasn't yours?
"The guards know who holds the purse strings in this city, and I don't like snoops."
Markarth is my city. You have no right looking into my business. Now get out.
For the Forsworn!
"What? By the gods, Betrid...."
My wife. They killed her.
Damn Madanach. Damn his Forsworn backside.
No you're not. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
Shut up. Only the gods can judge me. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
Fine. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
They're my puppets. I have their [QUOTE]king[QUOTE] rotting in Cidhna Mine.
He was supposed to keep them under control.
"When their uprising was crushed, I had Madanach brought to me. He was a wild animal, but a useful one."
"I offered him a stay from execution if he used his influence to deal with any annoyances that came up. Competitors, agents, idiots."
So I've let him run his little Forsworn rebellion from inside Cidhna Mine. Now he's out of control.
"You already got what you wanted, you damn hound. This is your fault."
"You and Madanach are animals, and I'll see you both rot to death in Cidhna Mine for this."
Now get out of my house!
Get of my house. Now.
Madanach. The King in Rags.
"While we were off fighting the Elves in the Great War, Madanach was busy ruling over the Reach."
Until Ulfric came and put them down.
My prison. The source of half the silver in Skyrim. The most secure prison in Tamriel.
No one escapes. I thought keeping Madanach down there would keep him under control.
Hardly likely.
Just shut up and keep out of sight.
"A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed."
"Legend has it that the crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and is said to increase the power of the wearer."
"Whatever the truth, if Ulfric get's his hands on it, it would be a powerful symbol around which to rally support for his cause."
"Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas, when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns."
"Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of Succession."
But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas.
I know Galmar. We fought in many wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes the crown is there... he's likely found it.
"We're backing Elisif. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing."
"We're backing Erikur. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing."
I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun.
I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Hrongar of Whiterun.
"We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support."
"This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only."
I trust you'll be finished with Fort Hraggstad soon?
Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to icicles! What are we even doing up here?
Guess Tullius wants to make sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for Eastmarch.
"Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, more so than when we took that wagon. But if we work together, we can pull this off."
Break our men out and head to the courtyard. We'll meet you there.
I can't believe we're the only ones who survived.
Glad you were here.
I guess... I'll hold down the fort by my lonesome. Hurry back and tell them to send a garrison. Quickly!
"You go report our success. I'll set up a garrison here. A shame none of the prisoners made it, but their names will be remembered."
Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!
Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean up the mess.
Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!
"Come, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!"
Yes. That's why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing.
"Woah there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed."
"To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs."
"If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck."
Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the Guild although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.
"The Nightingales protect the temple of Nocturnal, a place known as the Twilight Sepulcher."
What do you need?
What is it?
"Tell me again, why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale."
"If Ulfric gets his hand on that crown, it won't be a fairy tale. It'll be a problem."
Don't you Nords put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the Moot chose the king.
Not everyone's agreed to the Moot.
You've been here long enough to know that Nords aren't always sensible.
We follow our hearts.
So what - Ulfric gets this crown and then suddenly he's High King?
"No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent symbol for his cause to rally around."
"But, if we found it first..."
And we gave it to Elisif?
And we gave it to Erikur?
"In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim."
"In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize his claim."
"Perhaps... I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare. But I'm warning you, if this turns out to be a waste of time and men..."
It won't be a waste.
Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send him back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send her back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
The Stonefist's no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it first.
"What's the matter, soldier? I gave you an order. I want that fort, and I want it now. Move it!"
"Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed."
"But before we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion."
Speak with General Tullius. He'll administer the oath.
"We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth."
"You've done this city a mighty service, friend."
I believe you'll find the guards to be a bit more cordial with you in the future.
"Well, she's dead. But I guess that's not unusual, at least not for somebody in here."
"I mean, someone who's not me, that is."
"Sorry, was only joking with you."
"Oh, yes, right, of course!"
Not really.
The only unusual thing is the shape of the cuts.
"They look like they were made with... well, the ancient Nords used these kinds of curved blades when they embalmed their dead."
"I don't know who in Windhelm would even have something like that. Other than me, of course."
I'm too busy tending to the dead to spend my time making more of them.
"And I wouldn't very well tell you about the cuts if I had made them, now would I?"
"Now, I really got to get back to the body. Lot of work to prepare her for the grave."
I wouldn't hold out too much hope.
These fights are invite only. And you're not invited. Slag off.
"Out. She owns the place, she does what she wants."
"Inn's closed. Bar's still open, though."
Feel free to sit and put your head down on the table for as long as you like. I won't bother you.
Bring back this tablet that Farengar wants and I'll be in your debt.
That tablet is your priority now. Bring that back from Bleak Falls Barrow and I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.
I'll introduce you to Farengar. He can be a bit... difficult. Mages. You know.
Farengar can explain the situation better than I can.
Farengar is probably puttering around in his lab. Day and night. I'm not sure he ever sleeps.
"Here, take this as a small token of my esteem."
"There is another thing you could do for me. Suitable for someone of your particular talents, perhaps."
"Come, let's go find Farengar, my court wizard. He's been looking into a matter related to these dragons and... rumors of dragons."
"I'm sure Riverwood will be all right, dear. When the Jarl learns what's happened, he's sure to send soldiers."
"Go on, Hadvar. Let's hear the rest of it."
The Jarl has finally agreed to send you back to Riverwood.
I can't afford to send anyone else. And we don't know where the dragon is.
"Yes, Housecarl. We'll leave immediately."
Your main job will be to keep an eye out and get the people to safety if the town is attacked.
"It's just us against a dragon, is that it?"
I don't expect the three of you to fight off a dragon by yourselves. But I do expect you to do your duty.
Of course. We'll keep Riverwood safe. You can count on it.
Let's move out. Time's a wasting.
"I'm telling you, Ulfric's planning an attack on Whiterun."
He'd be insane to try. He doesn't have the men.
"That's not what my scouts report, sir. Every day more join his cause. Riften, Dawnstar, and Winterhold support him."
It's not a cause. It's a rebellion.
"Call it whatever you like, General. The man's going to try to take Whiterun."
Jarl Balgruuf...
Jarl Hrongar...
Balgruuf refuses the Legion's right to garrison troops in his city.
"On the other hand, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim."
Hrongar carries on the policies of his brother and refuses to acknowledge the Legions right to garrison troops in his city.
"On the plus side, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim."
"Well, if he wants to stand outside the protection of the Empire, fine. Let Ulfric pillage his city."
General.
You people and your damn Jarls.
Sir?
You can't force a Nord to accept help he hasn't asked for.
"I remember you, you were at Helgen. Speak to Legate Rikke. I suspect we could use someone like you."
Are my men now giving free reign to anyone who wanders into the castle?
"Do you have some reason to be here, citizen?"
There something I can do for you? Perhaps direct you to the nearest prison...
Have we?
Oh. Of course.
You were at Helgen!
"One of the prisoners, if I recall correctly."
Right... Helgen..
I suspect we might have use for someone resourceful like you. Not many survived Helgen.
"Besides, I'm sure your being imprisoned was all a terrible misunderstanding."
Hadvar's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good soldier.
"But he hasn't reported in yet, so he can't exactly confirm your story."
"In the meantime, why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke."
I suppose that's true. Fine.
Why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke?
Are you lost?
You survived Helgen? General Tullius told me what happened. Not many made it out alive...
I've got a good feeling about you. And I don't often get good feelings about anything. A warrior knows to trust her gut...
"I'm not going to go through the normal process with you. I've got a little test lined up. Pass that, and we'll talk about you joining the Legion."
Are you ready to test yourself at Fort Hraagstad?
"Is that confidence, or bravado? Confidence I can use. Bravado gets soldiers killed."
We'll soon find out.
"I'm sending you to clear out Fort Hraagstad. If you survive, you'll pass."
"If you die, then I'll have no further use for your corpse."
The kind that evaluates your usefulness during... duress.
The ancients built many of the fortresses that dot the landscape of Skyrim.
"Sadly, most have fallen into disrepair. And nearly all have been overrun with bandits or other vagabonds."
Fort Hraagstad is one of the few that remains mostly intact.
"We're going to install a garrison there, but first, your going to clean out the bandits that have moved in."
Is that so? I was right about you.
"Oh, not so confident now, are we?"
Yes. This is a test. I don't think you're regular militia material. I want to see what you're capable of.
"Well, if you change your mind, you know what to do."
"Good. That's what I want to hear. Now go make it happen, soldier."
Really? You're certainly... forthright about your criminal past.
But it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute. Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at Helgen.
"What do you say now, Proventus? Shall we continue to trust in the strength of our walls? Against a dragon?"
"My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once."
"It's in the most immediate danger, if that dragon is lurking in the mountains..."
The Jarl of Falkreath will view that as a provocation! He'll assume we're preparing to join Ulfric's side and attack him.
Enough!
"Irileth, send a detachment to Riverwood at once."
"Yes, my Jarl."
"Ah, indeed? The Jarl... Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons."
Hmm? What? Project? You think you could help me? I really don't think so.
"What? I'm not even... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the alchemical art."
"What? I never even cast... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the Higher Art."
"Where? I would never... ah, I see. You are a fellow enchanter."
"Please forgive my earlier rudeness. I am so often interrupted by visitors wandering in, I can occasionally become quite savage."
Now... what did you say you wanted?
"The Jarl can be found in the Great Hall, probably sitting on his Jarl's throne. Not over here in a wizard's laboratory."
"Straight to the point, eh? No need for tedious hows and whys. I like that. Leave those details to your betters, am I right?"
"Ah, no mere brute mercenary, but a thinker - perhaps even a scholar?"
"You see, when the stories of dragons began to circulate, many dismissed them as mere fantasies, rumors. Impossiblilities."
One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside his experience as being impossible.
But I began to search for information about dragons - where had they gone all those years ago? And where were they coming from?
"You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun, the sooner done, eh?"
"An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the Dragon War itself."
"Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there. It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of here."
I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right direction once you get there.
"Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my sources... reliable sources."
I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth.
"But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us."
"Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim."
"Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons."
"The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords."
"Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into historical times."
"Why, this very palace was built by one of Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name - Dragonsreach."
"Farengar, I see you've already met my new friend here."
I'm sure you two will get along famously.
"Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your dragon project."
Go ahead and fill him in with all the details.
Go ahead and fill her in with all the details.
"This is a priority now. Anything we can use to fight this dragon, or dragons. We need it, quickly. Before it's too late."
"Of course, Jarl Balgruuf. You seem to have found me an able assistant."
I'm sure he will prove most useful.
I'm sure she will prove most useful.
"Succeed at this, and you'll be rewarded. Whiterun will be in your debt."
We should not...
I'll not stand idly by while a dragon burns my hold and slaughters my people!
"If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my duties."
That would be best.
I should have guessed Ulfric would be mixed up in this.
"Alvor? The smith, isn't he? Reliable, solid fellow. Not prone to flights of fancy..."
And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?
"Gerdur? Owns the lumber mill, if I'm not mistaken. Pillar of the community. Not prone to flights of fancy..."
And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?
"By Ysmir, Irileth was right!"
"You'd better speak to the Jarl, then."
"Oh, yes? We'll get to that, after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation."
You were at Helgen when it was attacked? You saw this with your own eyes?
Perhaps some more Glow Dust in the next batch of potions. That should increase their resistance.
"No, but that won't account for the size issue. Blast, if only so many of these creatures hadn't escaped."
I knew that stupid kid would try and find a way to weasel out of his debt.
"Look, this is really simple. I lent him some gold, he promised to pay me back and now he says he's broke. End of story."
"All right, all right. I guess I made enough from his shipment. No need to waste any more time threatening a stable hand."
Tell Shadr he doesn't owe me anything.
"I don't care, a deal's a deal."
"Don't know why you'd help a stranger like that, but a septim's a septim... don't care where it comes from."
You can tell Shadr his debt's been paid.
"You don't have enough gold to pay it off, and I'm not cutting any deals."
"All right, all right! Take it easy. No idea why you'd care about a stranger so much, but this isn't worth a fight."
Tell Shadr I'm forgetting about his debt.
Ha ha! Are you kidding me? I've got the entire Thieves Guild at my back. What've you got?
"You can go back and forth all you want, he just needs to pay."
"Back off, this action's all mine. No room for anyone else in the Guild on this one."
"Why should I bother? I've already made a bunch of coin off of his shipment, so anything else I squeeze out of him would be a bonus."
Oh... wait a second. I see what this is. You want me to cut you in or you'll rat me out to Brynjolf.
Tell you what. I'll give you a share right now if you forget the whole thing.
Now you're talking.
"Oh, if you see Shadr, remind him he still owes me that debt."
"Woah, woah. Calm down. Let's just think about this for a moment."
Sigh. You win. Tell Shadr he can forget the debt.
"Oh, you heard about that, huh? Uh, sorry boss. I was going to speak to Delvin about cutting the Guild in, but I forgot."
"You aren't angry about it, right?"
"Yeah, I figured it would be like that. Here you go."
"I got the message. Consider it forgotten, boss."
"Oh. Well, thanks for trying I suppose. I'll just have to come up with the coin somehow."
By the Eight! You actually talked her into it?
I don't know what to say. I didn't think anyone in Riften even cared what happened to me.
"Look, I was saving this, but I wanted you to have it. I thought I might need it if Sapphire came for me, but I don't need it anymore."
"Hey, I cut you into the deal. There's nothing else to discuss."
"Look, I already said Shadr doesn't owe me a thing, so get off my back."
Yeah? What's your problem?
Any luck with Sapphire?
Huh? What do you want?
"Remember, this is between us now."
That'll teach me to try and make extra coin around this city.
Be careful with Sapphire. She's mixes with all sorts of nasty people.
Let's see if this works...
Step lightly. Who knows if those things can hear us or not.
Be careful. They're faster than you'd think.
"I heard Valdr made it back safe. Too bad about the others, but at least it's one less thing to worry about."
"Hello again, friend. I'll never forget what you did for me."
"Well, I used to sneak out at night and try to tip over the big ox in the Gray-Manes' yard."
And me and Mila used to climb up on the roof of Dragonsreach and look for birds' eggs.
But I don't do that stuff anymore. Father keeps catching me and then I get in trouble.
This has been going on for years. And all I've been able to find is murder and blood. I need help.
"Please. You find out why that woman was attacked, who's behind Weylin and the Forsworn, and I'll pay you for any information you bring me."
You want to walk away? Fine. But there's going to be no justice for that poor woman. No one to care what happened to her.
She's not from Markarth. The air about her screamed [QUOTE]outsider.[QUOTE]
Visitors to the city usually stay at the Silver-Blood Inn.
"He was one of the smelter workers. I used to have a job down there myself, casting silver ingots."
"I never knew much about Weylin, except he lives in the Warrens, like all the other workers."
They're remnants of the old rulers of Markarth. Natives of the Reach. Followers of the old ways.
The Nords drove them out of the city. Ulfric Stormcloak and his men. That was about 20 years ago.
"But somehow they're still here, and they're killing people."
Yes. It all started when I was a boy. My father owned one of the mines. Rare for anyone who isn't a Nord.
"He was killed. Guards said it was just a madman, but everyone knew the murderer was a member of the Forsworn."
"I've been trying to find out why ever since. Gotten nowhere so far, and then I got married. Have a child of my own on the way."
"I swore I was going to just give up, for my child's sake, but it's like my father's ghost is haunting me. Asking me [QUOTE]Why?[QUOTE]"
Please. I don't want to talk about it. All that blood.
"If you want answers, ask at the inn. She told me she was staying there."
Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market?
Didn't know her. Guards dragged her body away. Last we'll hear of that.
Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market the other day?
"Don't know her. Guards dragged that Forsworn's body away, though. Last we'll hear of that."
"Ah, yes. Rented the nicest room we had for a whole month."
I think she's sitting by the fire. Poor girl.
"Ah, yes. Rented the nicest room we had for a whole month."
Best we all forget about her. Bad luck to talk about the dead in Markarth.
Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Been sitting by the fire all day.
Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Had a room here I think. Ask the innkeeper.
Aye. She's by the fire.
"I remember her. Her stance. The way she walked. A trained warrior, no doubt."
She had a room here. Might talk to the innkeeper about it.
"Of course. But I can't just hand that over. Privacy, after all."
"Well, you seem like the honest sort. Here you are."
Right. You adventuring types would never go into a room just to steal everything.
"Well, I guess Margret isn't around to complain. It's yours."
"Sorry. Margret might be dead, but the room's rented."
All right. I don't want any trouble. It's yours.
Are you serious? I hear more threatening words from my wife.
Are you serious? I say more threatening words to my husband.
Did you need anything else?
"Oh, okay. I didn't think you'd help me. Nobody ever does."
"Oh, good. She'll listen to you, I just know it."
I'll just wait here and make sure nothing foul escapes the catacombs.
So be it. I'm sure Arkay will find it in his heart to forgive you... eventually.
"Well, as I said, Arkay is the god of life and death. You'll find his temples and Halls of the Dead all across Tamriel."
Priests of Arkay such as myself perform rites for the dead and sometimes console the bereaved.
We also keep a constant vigil against those who practice the vile arts of necromancy.
I asked the question because I was hoping you might be able to help me recover something I've lost.
"Think you've got the mettle, eh?"
"Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess."
"If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tulius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim."
But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.
"Think you've got the mettle, eh?"
"Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess."
"If you're serious, you're in the right place. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. Here you'll find General Tullius, commanding our forces in Skyrim."
But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.
"Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true son of Skyrim, or you're not."
"Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true daughter of Skyrim, or you're not."
You mean Ulfric's so-called [QUOTE]Stormcloak rebellion[QUOTE]?
"The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, [QUOTE]Jarls[QUOTE] - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order."
"Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally."
"But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough."
Skyrim is the birthplace of humanity. The birthplace of honor. And those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor.
"Worse still, to pay for the privilege to keep his throne, the Emperor sells Skyrim and our very gods - Talos, no less! - to the damn elves."
And what did Torygg do? He and the Jarls that supported him? They took the Emperor's gold. Sold out their people for a slave master's [QUOTE]peace treaty.[QUOTE]
"Ulfric did right killing him. Soon we'll rid Skyrim of elves, their bloody Justiciars, and the Jarls in their pockets. The whole damn lot of them."
And we'll cleave through the Legion to get to them.
Not sure I understand the question. The Legion's always been in Skyrim.
"We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry."
"Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call."
"At first they called us that to belittle our cause. But we gladly accept being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, the only true High King of Skyrim."
"We are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim, and Ulfric... he's the truest of us all."
"We fight to make our land great once more, to raise up strong, noble thanes, and lay low false Jarls and the cowards who hide behind them."
"The sound of our fury is a storm about to break on the heads of our enemies. Our friendship, a cloak of true brotherhood for all who would wear it."
"If you are, then you make your way to Windhelm and talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly."
"If you are, then you talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly."
"The Legion's always looking for strong, capable warriors. If you think you've got what it takes, our headquarters is in Solitude."
Speak with Legate Rikke. She will determine if you are Legion material.
Go on in.
"Oh, you again."
Don't cause any trouble in the city.
You're clear to enter.
Move along.
"Windhelm is one of the oldest human cities in all of Tamriel. In fact, it was the capital of the First Empire, which was founded by Ysgramor"
The Palace of the Kings in which you now stand is one of the last buildings that remain from that era.
"Long ago, the Empire used the city to garrison troops who guarded the passes to Morrowind."
"And now, thanks to you, the city is back under the Empire's banner."
"Well, a few reasons come to mind."
"In my days as a riverboat captain, I was known to run a tight ship."
"That, and I made my fortune by knowing when to spend my septims, and when not to. I can't stand waste."
"I wish I could say that it was, but it's not that simple."
"Many Stormcloaks will fight until they die, because they still believe they're fighting for Skyrim's freedom."
"But without Ulfric, the movement will wither and die. It's only a matter of time."
"Well, looks like you're fitting in well down here."
"I'm supposed to allow you to trade in one of your pieces of Guild armor, so what will it be?"
"Of course... otherwise it wouldn't be much of a reward, now would it?"
Your new piece will enhance your skill beyond that of the original. Trust me.
"Are you sure? Once I exchange it for you, I'm not taking it back... unless you want to sell it at a discount of course."
Make up your mind already.
"Okay, there you go."
Tough luck for you then. Come back when you have at least one of the pieces.
"Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you."
"I've had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I hope it brings you the same luck."
You'll see! It was a dragon! It'll kill us all and then you'll believe me!
"Jarl Balgruuf? He rules Whiterun Hold. A good man, perhaps a bit over-cautious, but these are dangerous times."
"So far he's managed to stay out of the war. I'm afraid it can't last, though."
I don't think he likes either Ulfric or Elisif much. Who can blame him?
But I've no doubt he'll prove loyal to the Empire in the end. He's no traitor.
Of course. Skyrim has always been part of the Empire.
"That doesn't mean I support everything the Empire's been doing lately, but Nords have never been fair-weather friends."
"Ah, I forget you're new to Skyrim. Jarl Elisif, I should say, although only because she was married to Jarl Torryg when he was murdered."
"Ulfric murdered Torygg, you know. Walked right into his palace in Solitude and killed him. Shouted him to death, if you believe the stories."
"That's what started this whole war. The Empire couldn't ignore that. Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days."
"What would you have me do, then? Nothing?"
My lord. Please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we need more information before we act.
My lord. Please. You have to listen.
I only counsel caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in times like these.
"If the news from Helgen is true... well, there's no telling what it means."
"Who's this, then?"
I just...
What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruuf is not receiving visitors.
"Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally."
"As housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that threaten the Jarl or his people. So you have my attention. Now, explain yourself."
You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Approach.
"Whatever you have to say to the Jarl, you can say to me."
I'm starting to think...
"It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to say."
"It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what she has to say."
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left her?
And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why she left you.
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left him?
And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why he left you.
"Gods, what a mess."
"Hey, what the...?"
"Well, you could always speak to Delvin or Vex if you're looking for extra work."
"Or if you're looking for training, we've got plenty of it down here. Delvin, Vex, Niruin and Vipir can give you a leg up on that."
"If you're lookin' to get some coin for the fruits of your labor, you should talk to Tonilia. She sounds tough, but she'll cut you a fair deal."
I also suggest you spend some time in the trainin' room. Just talk to Vipir. He'll show you around.
"If you're ever in need of some quick coin for items you find on the job, Tonilia is the best fence around."
"And besides myself, Delvin, Niruin and Vipir can help you with any sort of training you might need to sharpen your skills."
I'll point you to the first and last person you're ever going to need to talk to. Tonilia. She's the Guild's fence.
Treat her right and she'll make you rich. Try and rip her off and you'll have the whole Guild to answer to.
"If talking your way out of trouble isn't enough, you could always pick up some training from Delvin, Vex or Vipir."
"Also, I recommend hitting the training room if you need lockpick practice. Helped me out of a jam more than once."
"So, you're the new recruit, eh?"
"Well, looks like you and I are going to have to get very well acquainted."
"I'm the fence down here. You come by anything you don't exactly own and I'll pay you some coin for it. Minus a little slice for the Guild, of course."
"I can also provide a few supplies useful to our trade now and again, for a small fee."
"Sure, how about I get Dirge to knock you over your head and dump you into the cistern?"
"Look, I've been in this business a long time and I've seen all types. You can play it tough, you can play it smart... whatever."
At the end of the day you'll find all we care about down here is how much gold you can make us.
Good. Then there isn't much more to say.
"Here's your armor, just make sure you put it to good use."
Huh?
"You know who I am, fool. So why you askin'?"
"You blind, boy? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that."
"You blind, girl? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that."
I don't think so.
"Oh... well, I'll leave that to you. I trust you know your business."
Probably for the best. It will give me time to see if that old trap still works - and break the news to the men.
"Odahviing will come to your challenge. Boziik. Krilot. He will not be able to resist your call, from the Hill of the Dovah itself... he will come."
"Hmm, yes. I have been pondering on exactly that question. Lingrah morah."
"I have tasted the voices of Alduin's allies on the wind. Pogaan nahlaas, vokrii wah jun."
There is one who I remember well. Odahviing. He is the one to tell us where Alduin has gone.
"Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always made up of three Rotmulaag - Words of Power."
"You see - Paar-thur-nax - a Thu'um - a Shout, yes?"
"He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature. Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin."
"But Odahviing, he is... headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the dov, he was known for this."
"He will not resist the challenge of your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come."
Now - hear his name. Odahviing. Taste it on the wind. Od-ah-viing. Know it in your su'um. Od-ah-viing!
Housecarl! No!
The Jarl's down!
Why are we doing this again?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
"Dragonborn, do whatever you're going to do!"
"We may not be trying to kill him, but he sure seems to be trying to kill us!"
We've got to bring it down!
Damn dragon!
Dovahkiin! Here I am!
Faaz! Nah!
So this is how you defeated Alduin. Ruth... zu'u ni Alduin.
Your Thu'um is no match for mine.
Do not try to hide from me.
Nivahriin joorre!
My Thu'um is strong!
"Ni faas, Dovahkiin!"
I will conquer where Alduin failed.
"I claim the glory of your defeat, Dovahkiin!"
"Your Thu'um is strong, Dovahkiin. But not strong enough!"
Thu'um wah Thu'um!
Hold your fire until he's close!
Steady now!
We need to bring it down!
Keep under cover until it's down!
That's it!
We've almost got it!
You. You're coming with me.
We're finally going to arrest the Butcher.
"Yes, sir."
What is the meaning of this?
"You're under the arrest, for the Murder of Susanna of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest."
"We're wise to your scheming, you coward."
Has the whole city lost their brains?
I've been scrying and auguring to find the murderer myself.
"Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard."
Get him out of my sight.
"Yes, sir!"
"I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me."
"This isn't over, Jorleif!"
In you go.
I've got some fresh cabbage. I'm thinking of making some apple cabbage stew.
Dorthe won't eat that. Are you trying to starve the child?
"She needs to learn to eat what I serve her. I swear, you spoil that child rotten. Besides, it's one of your favorites."
"Ay, it is.  I suppose it won't hurt the girl to eat it this once."
"And speaking of spoiling Dorthe, who made her a new doll last week?"
Just never you mind about that.
Can the sawmill handle those logs? They look a might big.
"Ay, it can. Wouldn't want them any bigger though."
And the blade?
Gettin' dull. We'll need a new one soon.
I'll talk to Alvor about getting us a new one.
"How's about a drink, Hod."
You'll be wantin' me to pay for them?
It's only right seein' as your the important lumber man.
"You come do an honest day's work at my mill, and I'll pay you an honest day's wages. Then we'll drink."
"I need some more ale, Orgnar."
"You've had more than enough. Besides, you still haven't paid for the last one."
I'll find some coin for you. I always do.
"Until then, I've no ale for you."
Release...me.
Uhhh.
That would be wonderful.
"I'll be sure and have everything ready. This is exciting, isn't it?"
"Ah, well now you can help me directly! Far more useful, I think."
Please do let me know if you change your mind.
"Not much, I'm afraid. It was named Kahvozein's Fang after the dragon worshipped by this particular sect of the cult."
"They were said to be quite fond of ritual sacrifices. So fond, in fact, that the high priest spent a great deal of time sharpening the dagger."
That way it was always ready for the next inevitable victim.
"Perhaps not the brightest spot in Skyrim's history, eh?"
Not just any dragon scales. Heartscales. Very special.
"You'll need Kahvozein's Fang, of course."
"Then, if you should happen upon the corpse of a dragon, you should be able to use it to slice off a heartscale or two."
Even just one should be enough for me to complete my research.
"Wonderful, just wonderful!"
And it's just as I suspected. The energies need to be channeled back through the nexus a second and third time...
And that's it. I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the tome. Use it well!
"Yes, very good."
"Here, then, is the first of the Illusion spells you sought."
Karliah... she's still alive?
"I feared she'd befallen the same fate, ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal."
Don't you see? I was like a daughter to Tova. A sister to Nilsine and Friga. But the family refuses to believe my innocence. No matter what I say.
"Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving for Friga, too? No... they treated me like garbage, threw me away."
"With Nilsine dead, maybe then Tova will realize what she's lost, hmm? Maybe then she'll see that I was just as much a daughter as the others."
"And if not, may she drown in her own tears."
"These fruits and vegetables are disappointing, Carlotta."
"I get them fresh from the farms daily, Nazeem."
"If you were getting them from my farm, they'd be twice as fresh."
Watch out!
"Come on now, old girl."
"Gee up, there!"
Look out!
Never been to Whiterun before? The Jarl's palace is something to see. Dragonsreach they call it. Big old dragon skull hanging on the wall.
"First time to Solitude? Beautiful old city. Capital of Skyrim, but I'm sure you already knew that."
Ever been to Markarth? Some say it was built by the dwarves. I don't believe a word of it though.
"If you've never been to Riften, be sure to visit the Black-Briar meadery. A few mugs of that and you'll forget all about the long trip."
"Ever been to Windhelm? Oldest city in Skyrim, by some accounts. They say the big old palace there was built by Ysgramor himself."
Solitude's famous for it's Bards College. Worth a visit if you've never been. Some of them can sing just as pretty as a lark.
"Solitude's a big port town, you know? Full of sailors and their tales of far away lands. Most of 'em's foreigners and liars, of course."
"You'll want to watch out for the Forsworn if you do any travelling around the Reach. Bloodthirsty bastards, them."
"If you don't mind a piece of advice, I'd stay out of trouble in Markarth. They'll toss you in the Cidhna Mine, and you'll never get out."
"When I'm in Whiterun, I always visit the Gildergreen. Never hurts to pay your respects to Lady Kynareth, particularly in my line of work."
You'll want to watch yourself in Riften. A lot of ways to get yourself in trouble in that town.
I might have to stop and get myself a pint of Black-Briar mead while I'm in Riften. Almost worth the trip all by itself.
"You might run into some of them lizard-folk in Riften. Quite a few of them work the docks there, not sure why. Like swimming in the lake, maybe."
"Windhelm's a bit cold for my tastes. And I ain't talking about the weather. You're not from Windhelm, are you?"
"You'll find Windhelm's full of dark elves. The kind from Morrowind, you know. Not that I have anything against them, long as they keep to themselves."
"There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!"
"You ever met one of them cats? - kah-jeet, I think they call themselves. I hear there's whole countries full of them down south."
"Gee up, there."
"Steady, old girl."
"Sun feels good, hmm?"
It's almost getting downright hot out now.
Couldn't ask for better weather.
Nice weather for a ride. Hope it lasts.
"This'll clear up soon, I'm sure of it."
Why is it always raining?
This rain will stop eventually. Always does.
Hope you're not getting too wet back there.
Better bundle up. This may keep up for a while.
"A little snow never stopped me, don't worry."
I bet you'll be glad to get to Whiterun and get out of this weather.
You picked quite a day for a trip to Solitude.
You picked quite a day for a trip to Markarth.
I swear it rains like this every time I go to Riften.
Better get used to it. Snows most all the time in Windhelm.
"Well, seems like you have a bit of gold left in your pockets, don't you, my friend?  Mmm, yes..."
Let me just take this coin purse off your hands for you. And those nice boots you've got there.
"Now you just stay here, with all your friends, and I'm going to go get my shovel."
"Two things I have for you. Two shapes. One edged, one round."
"The round one, for tuning. Dwemer music is soft and subtle, and needed to open their cleverest gates."
"The edged lexicon, for inscribing. To us, a hunk of metal. To the Dwemer, a full library of knowings. But... empty."
Find Mzark and its sky-dome. The machinations there will read the Scroll and lay the lore upon the cube.
Trust Septimus. He knows you can know.
"Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?"
Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your Stormcloak colors?
All right. Let's take a look...
"Ah, good. Looks like the reinforcements for the fort are on the way. And we have some information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent."
"It's not easy running messages, what with Imperials scouts crawling all over the place. Well done."
Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak before heading back?
"Thank you, soldier. Let's take a look at these reports..."
"I'm waiting on word about reinforcements for the fort... Good, they're on the way. And we have some information on enemy troop movements. Excellent."
Stormcloak scouts are making it difficult to move around. It's good you made it here in one piece.
Why don't you have yourself a drink at the Moorside before you head back?
Alduin? The World-Eater himself? But... how can we fight him? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
How can we fight Alduin? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
I didn't say anything about giving up.
"I don't know about such things, but I heard the Greybeards summon you. That's good enough for me."
"Spoken like a true Nord. I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn."
"No Nord could have said it better! I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn."
"Now, what's this nonsense about trapping a dragon in my palace?"
"I want to help you, Dragonborn. And I will. But I need your help first."
"Aye, Dragonborn. Maybe you can stop the dragons - and this war into the bargain."
"Then... Whiterun will stand with you, Dragonborn. We will take the risk, and gain the glory, whether it be in victory or defeat!"
"So what's the plan, then? How do you intend to lure a dragon into the trap?"
"As I promised, my men stand ready. The great chains are oiled. We wait on your word."
"We'll be ready, don't worry. You do have a plan for actually luring a dragon into this trap, don't you?"
"My men will be ready when you are, Dragonborn. You have a truce to arrange first, eh?"
What? A dragon? In Helgen?
That explains what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I was hoping I was wrong about what I thought it was...
"Suit yourself. I hate to turn away any friend of Hadvar, but in times like these... you understand if I can't just take your word for it."
"A dragon... here in Skyrim. What's this world coming to? First the war, now dragons... trouble loves company, they say..."
"You're right, I saw it. Didn't want to believe my own eyes, is all."
The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...
"We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt."
There's something you could do for me. For all of us here.
This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?
You realize this is exactly what they wanted.
What who wanted?
The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.
"It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?"
Heh.
We aren't the bad guys you know.
"Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys."
Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?
You just said it yourself.
It makes us right.
And if I surrender?
The Empire I remember never surrendered.
That Empire is dead. And so are you.
So be it.
Just kill him and let's be done with it already.
"Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?"
By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after - perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.
Good point.
"Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?"
"Song or not, I just want it done."
As you wish.
"Well, I'm not quite done myself."
"As you wish. This moment, we three, will be immortalized in song."
Fine by me.
"Dragonborn. Here, use my sword to do it. This moment will be immortalized in song. Make it a good kill."
"Here, use my sword to do it. I made sure to sharpen it for the occasion."
Enough... enough...
"No, I'm not. Looks like we've got something in common, then."
"Hmph. No, friend, that I'm not. But I get along with your kind well enough."
"Ha! And neither are you, eh? Good to see another Redguard. I like to think we bring a little heat to this frozen wasteland."
"No, I'm a Redguard. My family hails from the Imperial Province. Ah, but I left home when I was just a lad. Been wandering ever since."
Ha! I thought as much.
"Sulla look, the passage is open, wait... there's someone down there!"
No! Blackreach was to be my discovery!
"Sulla, let's just get out of here. Hasn't there been enough death?"
"Oh, of course you want me to leave. Just waiting for me to turn my back. So you can have all the glory for yourself!"
Halt! City's closed with the dragons about. Official business only.
"Riverwood's in danger, too? You'd better go on in. You'll find the Jarl in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill."
"The Jarl will definitely want to talk to you. You'll find him in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill."
"Fine, but we'll be keeping an eye on you."
"Welcome to Whiterun, friend. Go right on in."
Or else what? You think you can stand against the entire Whiterun city guard? The gate's closed.
Safe travels.
"Oh yes, many times. But mighty Talos was my keeper, my shield against the heresy of the south!"
"If not for Talos, and a few modest bribes paid to the right jailors, why, I would not be standing before you today, resplendent in my faith!"
"Of course! I know, today wasn't the best introduction to the Legion, but I hope you'll give us another chance."
"The Legion could really use someone like you, especially now."
"And if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one who can stop them."
"General Tullius has his headquarters in Castle Dour, in the city of Solitude, northwest of here."
You'll want to talk to Legate Rikke. She deals with the new recruits.
I'll be sure to put in a good word for you if I get back to Solitude first.
"I hope so. The Legion is Skyrim's only hope right now. Come on, we'd better get moving."
"Sure, I understand. It's not easy to go from being executed by the Legion one day to joining up the next."
But I think you'll see that the Legion is Skyrim's only hope for real peace right now. I know you'll make the right choice in the end.
You don't have to say sorry to me. I just hope the Eight bring us more peace in the future.
"Huh. Not sure. I don't worship Talos, myself."
"I think I heard someone mention it was underneath the Temple of Dibella, in the big crag in the center of the city."
No. I was just getting some fresh air. Had one too many pints of mead at the Silver-Blood Inn.
We're not done here.
"Hmm. This is intriguing, but highly disturbing."
It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months.
Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an [QUOTE]...unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.[QUOTE]
Does the journal say where this wealth came from?
Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.
"Anything else, Enthir? Anything about... the Nightingales?"
"Hmm. Yes, here it is."
The last few pages seem to describe [QUOTE]the failure of the Nightingales[QUOTE] although it doesn't go into great detail.
Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.
Shadows preserve us. So it's true...
I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?
"I'm sorry Enthir, I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately."
"Farewell, Enthir... words can't express..."
It's alright Karliah. You don't have to say a word.
"As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher."
"I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to have to ask that you continue to trust me."
I think my voice is ready. I hope we've done this well.
Secure the door.
Already done.
Ulfric. Stop.
Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot?
You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will assuredly fall to the Dominion.
You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that damn treaty was the day the Empire died.
"The Empire is weak, obsolete. Look at how far we've come and with so little."
"When we're done rooting out Imperial influence here at home, then we will take our war to the Aldmeri Dominion."
You're a damn fool.
Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.
He has given up. But I have not.
Rikke. Go.
You're free to leave.
I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.
You're also free to die for it.
This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other?
Families torn apart?
This is the Skyrim you want?!
"Damnit woman, stand aside."
That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.
Rikke. You don't have to do this.
You've left me no choice...
Talos preserve us.
Always was a stubborn woman. She's not going to stand down.
"War always comes down to this, doesn't it? A single truth-laden moment."
Dragonborn... Perhaps this is the fate of Skyrim after all. To be destroyed from the inside.
"You're a cold hearted bastard, aren't you?"
I fear that will be the way of it.
A true Nord never fears death. It's the how and why of it that one needs consider.
"Aye, I'll hate it, but I'll do it if I have to."
"It's up to her, isn't it?"
"If that must be, then it will. And why should I be any different? How many the lives already lost. What's one more?"
"Killing Commander Maro would do no good. Someone would merely replace him. No, we need him to remain in charge. But... distracted. Weakened."
"Implicate and kill his son Gaius, and the commander will be grief-stricken and humiliated, his family name ruined. The security plan will then fail."
"Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had already been discovered and foiled."
"He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim."
"Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis."
"Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest."
"Oh, and one final thing..."
"Walk in Gaius Maro's shadow, and deliver to him the judgment of Sithis."
"The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!"
Chops and steaks fit for a Jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs!
Shiny trinkets for your good lady! All crafted by the great Eorlund Gray-Mane himself!
"Bits and baubles for sale, all crafted by the best blacksmith in Skyrim."
Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale!
"Fresh-baked loaves, still warm from the oven!"
"Take pity, sir, and spare me a few septims."
"Take pity, lady, and spare me a few septims."
Spare a coin for a poor old beggar?
A few septims for my supper is all I ask.
"I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims."
If you have need of hunting supplies then you've come to the right place.
"We sell bows, arrows and ale. A unique combination, to be sure."
I'll be happy to assist you if you'd like to purchase something.
I can tell you're no stranger to the wilds. I'm sure we can meet your hunting needs.
We've got arms and armor of all kinds.
"You look like someone who knows how to wield a weapon. Well, you've come to the right place."
"If it's armor you need, we've got all kinds, both light and heavy."
Everything you see here was made with skill and care by my wife Adrianne.
"Please, do look around. I'm sure I have something you'll want."
"I can tell you're a discriminating customer. Perhaps you're a wealthy one, too, hm?"
"Everything's for sale, my friend! You need visit no other shops today!"
"I assure you, I'm prepared to make any deal."
"You'll find tonics, salves, poultices and potions on my shelves. Browse to your heart's content."
I offer remedies for ailments both common and rare. Do let me know if I can be of service.
"If there's anything I can help you with, you have but to ask."
"I sell cures for all ills, and I'll be happy to serve you."
"Forgive me, my lord. It was foolish of me to make such a suggestion."
You must be a Stormcloak through and through to request that one.
Only true Imperials request that one.
"Ahhh, a fine but bloody tale. I can do that one."
"Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it."
One moment.
So. You were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes?
What's this about Riverwood being in danger?
Well. I trust you have something vitally important to tell me. Important enough to interrupt me in the middle of council?
What in Oblivion is that?
Sentries! What do you see?
Don't just stand there! Kill that thing!
"Guards, get the townspeople to safety!"
Someone get the battlemages out here. Now!
I don't care... We're going all the way in. I want to know what Shalidor hid in here.
"You want to stay here, fine. But the rest of us aren't giving up now."
"No, no. You just stay here and rest."
We'll come back for you as soon as we've reached our goal. You have my word.
Once again you have come seeking something.
The circumstances differ. This time I have what you seek.
Are you prepared?
The trial awaits. Are you now prepared?
Colette has already told you. You must be tested before knowledge can be imparted to you.
Arrogance will serve you poorly. Your worth must be determined before knowledge can be bestowed upon you.
And so you shall be tested.
"You will rely on your skill as a mage. Not on your belongings, not on your scrolls and potions. Only what lies within."
"Survive, and you are worthy. This is the test put before you. Will you accept?"
"Step into the light, and your test begins."
"Knowledge is power. Knowing spells can be powerful, but applying that knowledge is key."
You will be called upon to rely solely on your Restoration spells.
You are not worthy!
At this very moment? No. However...
"Well, I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell."
"I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help."
I need dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
I need you to collect some dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
"As I've said, I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough."
"My knowledge of Skyrim's history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things."
"First, there are ancient references to dragon [QUOTE]heartscales[QUOTE]. What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need."
"Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve individual scales off a dragon."
"First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few scales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one."
What's happened? Did you find a way to learn the Dragonrend Shout?
Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to the Throat of the World?
Esbern should be able to help. He's spent his whole life poring over every old book he could find about dragons and that prophecy.
"He's been digging around the records the Blades left here, too. But we can talk about that later."
I don't have time for your foolishness. Either help me or be gone.
He must be here somewhere...
"Ah, a secret admirer, eh? Don't worry, I won't tell a soul."
Calcelmo? Is he interested in Faleen? That sly old codger. I should have guessed.
Good for him. For the both of them.
"Between you and me, she could use a bit of warmth."
As for what she might like...
"I didn't tell you this. Faleen likes to act tough, but she really has a soft spot for, of all things, poetry."
"You know, I took some classes at the Bards College as a youth. Poems come in handy when wooing."
"There's a poem I once used on an older lady of Rorikstead. I can change it to be about Faleen, if you've got some gold."
You should probably just take this directly to Faleen. Wouldn't want the old icebrain stumbling over the words.
You should probably just let Faleen read it herself. Don't want you stumbling over the words and ruining my flow.
"We have a cozy little profit. Here. This is your share, love."
"We've made a bit of gold. Here, love, this is your share."
"Fortune smiles on us. Here's your share, love."
"The gold is flowing nicely. Here's your half of the profits, my dear."
"You want your share, don't you? Here you are, love."
"Of course it has. Would you expect any less of me? Here, this is your half, my love."
"It has. Here, this is your half, love."
Kyr's orders. Nobody goes in or out until he gets back. Or the boss will skin you soon as he's done with Ra'jirr.
What? There's a whole shift down there!
There she is!
Get her!
The boss went down there? Today?
"Yeah, he's after Ra'jirr- never seen him so angry."
I've got a bad feeling about this... something's just felt wrong down there lately. Eerie.
Now you're sounding as crazy as the cat. Be going on about the Pale Lady next.
"Hey, kinsman. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, dark elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, Breton. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, Khajiit. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, Argonian. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, high elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, wood elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, Redguard. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, Orc. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
"Hey, you. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
We need to move. Now!
Up the stairs! Quickly!
Move! Up the tower!
Come on! Before the dragon brings down the whole tower!
What are you waiting for? Up the stairs! Now!
"You should be more careful with the men you pick, dear."
He said he loved me....
Real men prove their love. Words are as empty as the air they run through.
"Stop moping about, girl. Tears won't change what you've done."
I was such a fool. How could I let him use me like that?
"We all get used, dear. It's living with it that makes you a woman."
Jarl Elisif the Fair. Poor woman. Losing her husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all.
"Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to her steward, Falk Firebeard. He ordered a special bottle of Stros M'Kai Rum."
Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to the Blue Palace.
"Yeah, thanks."
"Oh right, the rum. Thank you. I developed a taste for it after a fair weather trip to Hammerfell."
"Here, this is for you."
Traitor!
Liar!
He doesn't deserve to speak!
Booooo.
Booooo.
Booooo.
Cut em down!
Stand back. Interrupting an execution is a serious crime.
"I'm sorry about Roggvir. It's a shame, I liked him."
Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore.
"Jawanan, I don't see you here often."
I do not like fish.
Okay. Well. That's all I've got.
I am buying a fish for Noster. He likes fish.
A sale's a sale but I have to know... why are you buying something for Noster?
A war veteran should be respected.
Salmon sounds good today.
"Speaking of sounding good, I've heard a couple of your classmates on the street recently."
As long as they're playing instruments they're passable. You don't want to hear them sing.
I wish we could have absolved your brother-in-law of his sins before his execution.
"I don't think he would have wanted your absolution, Rorlund. He worshiped Talos."
I appreciate the thought though.
"Fresh fish sounds like just the thing today, Addvar."
I've been pushing the Salmon but I'll tell you the Slaughterfish is a bit better today.
"Thank you, Addvar, I am picky about what I eat these days."
A little late in the day for your rounds Sorex.
I seem to have more chores for the Winking Skeever each day. I still have a delivery to do too.
"You know, my father collected exotic alcohols."
Really?
"Rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall and the like."
"None of what he collected tasted as good as your Spiced Wine, Evette."
I'm still finding your Spiced Wine to be the best drink I've ever tasted.
"Thanks, Aia. That means a lot."
"Glad to hear it, Aia."
Shoot the far target.
We've talked about speed and composure. Now we'll go over precision.
Often times you won't be able to get as close to your prey as you'd like and you'll have to settle with a long shot.
"However, with such a long shot, it's more than likely that's the only shot you'll be able to take before your prey runs off."
"If you find yourself in such a situation, then you need to make your shot count."
"Don't rush your shot. Crouch down, get comfortable, and take aim."
"OK, your turn. Try and hit that target way in the back, far behind the other three. Remember to take your time and make your shot count."
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have ten seconds to hit each of the four targets. Draw string and get ready.
You did it! All four targets in ten seconds. Nice job.
"We've talked about composure, speed, and precision."
Now it's time to use all three at once.
"I'm warning you now, this challenge will be quite difficult."
Just remember everything I've taught you and you should be able to complete it.
"It may take you a couple of tries, but that's what practice is all about."
"When I tell you to, try and hit all four targets in ten seconds."
But... Eisa? She's smarter than that.
Ra'jirr was always dragging her into things.
But.. stealing the boss's sword? Did he have a death wish?
Who knows. The cat was crazy. She was a fool to trust him.
"Who in Dagon's name are you? Speak, or I'll cut you down where you stand."
"Damn it, not now!"
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother.
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Sister.
"Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you."
Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in Jorrvaskr.
The old man's got a good sense for people. He can look in your eyes and tell your worth.
"If you go to him, good luck."
Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity to take on a giant.
That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.
Ha. Another milk drinker crying about his effort.
Glory only awaits those who triumph.
"And as Companions, our glory must always be hard-fought."
"Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk to Kodlak Whitemane."
See what a warrior of true mettle is like.
Already did. Part of the reason I'm living out here now. Thanks for offering though.
"If you need a bow, there's one on the rack to the left of the door."
"I'd give you a bow, but it looks like you've already taken it from the rack."
What kind of a mentor would I be if I denied a potential student a glimpse at his master's ingenuity!
"Here, this key will provide access to my museum. Feel free to browse for as long as you wish."
"However, I must insist that my laboratory remains strictly off limits."
"While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline."
"Being an admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research a secret."
Do you realize that at a snap of my fingers I can bring the entire Markarth city guard to my defense?
You best rethink this course of action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.
Only inside the gates. Much of Falkreath hold is wilderness and there's plenty of trouble to be had.
"Done. Now move along, before you get me in trouble."
"Suit yourself, but you better decide what you want to do about this arrest. No one walks away for free."
"Not so tough now, are you?"
I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect.
One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.
"Hey, ugly!"
"Hey, slug-breath!"
"Hey, skeever butt!"
"Hey, cheese brain!"
"Hey, melon nose!"
"Hey, troll bait!"
They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable.
This one doesn't look too difficult.
That should do it. After you.
"Quite simple really, I don't know what the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill."
"Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint."
"Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm certain Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own."
"Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really."
"Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving."
I set up those targets a long time ago. I shoot at them from time to time. Don't want to get rusty with my bow.
That I am. You know how to use one?
There's a whole college up in Solitude where they teach the arts. Song. Lute-playing. Poetry.
"I studied there myself. Had to leave over a misunderstanding with a headmistress. Well, more a misunderstanding with her husband."
"Got stones in your ears? I asked what side you're on, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born!"
"Then you're either a Stormcloak sympathizer or a fool. Either way, you're no friend of mine."
"Then I say well met, friend. I could tell you were a sharp one the moment I laid eyes on you."
"New in town, huh? Whiterun's got two clans, both old and both respected."
"Difference is, the Gray-Manes turned their backs on the Empire and we Battle-Borns stayed loyal."
"So I'll ask again, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?"
Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
"Sooner or later, we all have to choose a side."
I suppose it would be better than sitting around thinking about all this.
Keep Mother's staff. Think of it as payment. I want to leave everything from this cursed place behind. Goodbye. And thank you.
"I could also do some good for a change. Sure, I'd go with you."
I moved here from Helgen after my family was killed.
"At the time I couldn't stand to be around anyone. They all felt sorry for me and I didn't want them to. It was my problem, not theirs."
Name's Angi and if you try anything stupid I won't hesitate to put in arrow in your head.
"Sorry, a girl can't be too careful out here."
"Like I said, name's Angi and I've been living out here for a couple of years now."
Did you hear all that noise outside?
It's just the market rabble. We should get back to work.
"You there. If you're here to trade, step up to the counter."
"I'm a Dark Elf and I live in Windhelm, so yes, I live in the Gray Quarter."
"You must be new around here, or you'd know they don't let my kind live anywhere outside that slum."
"It was difficult at first. The Nords of this city are, at best, suspicious of outsiders."
"But in time, I made the right friends and proved myself useful enough that they don't give me trouble anymore."
"The dark elves are too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are, and so they continue to dwell in that slum."
"They're parasites. They're living in our city, under our protection, but what do they do for us? Nothing!"
"I know the High King invited them here, but he didn't ask me or anyone else first. Maybe he should have."
Wouldn't surprise me. They've done nothing to help in the fight for Skyrim's freedom.
"Those Thalmor are elves, too. I bet they're working together."
Maybe I should round up some men and take us a few prisoners to interrogate.
Not a chance. Not for this. You're going to the Cidhna Mine for the rest of your days.
"Well... maybe just this once. But there's still a price on your head. Better make yourself scarce, or we'll have to do this little dance again."
"Nothing new there. Most of the Nords living in Windhelm don't care much for us, but Rolff is the worst by far."
"He likes to get drunk and walk around the Gray Quarter yelling insults at us in the small hours of the morning. A real charmer, that one."
"Dovahkiin, you call yourself? Arrogant mortal."
Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor.
I will feast on your soul in Sovngarde!
"You are no match for me, joor!"
Paarthurnax is weak. I am strong.
My time has come again.
Maar saraan ko Sovngarde.
"You are no match for me, Dovahkiin."
I have feasted on many greater than you.
You will pay for your defiance!
"My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!"
Man gives bards a bad name.
We Nords have a long history as warrior poets. I am proud to count myself among them.
But Mikael... He sings only for gold and the affections of wenches. He dishonors our traditions.
I need some things for the ship.
"If you give me a list, I'll have them delivered to the dock by tomorrow morning."
My tunic is fading. Too much sun and salt spray.
I doubt it can be repaired. You'll have to buy a new one.
Back so soon Xander?
Can you make some new poultices for my...you know?
You should be more careful about the women you spend time with in port. Come back later and it will be ready.
Grrah!
We've got a murderer on the loose...
"What...? Whoever did this, you're dead. You hear me? Dead!"
"Kill one of us, and three more will take their place. The Forsworn are unstoppable."
"Your body lies dead, but your soul has joined our ranks..."
Freshly killed. Whoever did this is still close... and will suffer for their insolence.
Damn. We've got trouble.
Sovngarde take your soul. I'll avenge your body.
"Well now, this is unexpected..."
I'll claw the eyes out of whoever did this!
Dead! Someone's going to pay for this.
No...
Hsss! Dead. Who did this?
"Damn it, this will not stand!"
"What...? No... No, this can't be happening..."
A...a body! How absolutely terrible.
"Murdered? By Azura, who would do such a thing?"
What? Someone will suffer for this injustice.
"I'm going to find whoever did this, and when I do..."
By Ysmir! There's a killer about.
Hmph. Looks like we got a cutthroat skulkin' around...
Ain't nothing pretty about a corpse. No matter how fresh.
Gormlaith! We're running out of time! The battle...
"If I die today, it will not be in terror."
"You feel fear for the first time, worm. I see it in your eyes."
"No, damn you!"
You are banished!
Meyye! Tahrodiis aanne! Him hinde pah liiv! Zu'u hin daan!
Faal Kel...?! Nikriinne...
"Begone, World-Eater! By words with older bones than your own we break your perch on this age and send you out!"
"You are banished! Alduin, we shout you out from all our endings unto the last!"
Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll.
Look at you. Such a devoted student of Restoration.
It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the College. Truly comforting.
It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur.
"Oh, didn't you know?"
"Oh, goodness no. There are those far more skilled than I."
The Augur was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend.
"He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration. He's... Well, he's very particular about who shares the knowledge."
"So you'll need his approval first. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you."
You are worthy. The knowledge is yours.
"You come here where you're not wanted, you eat our food, you pollute our city with your stink and you refuse to help the Stormcloaks."
"Hey, maybe the reason these gray-skins don't help in the war is because they're Imperial spies!"
Imperial spies? You can't be serious!
"Maybe we'll pay you a visit tonight, little spy. We got ways of finding out what you really are."
But we haven't taken a side because it's not our fight.
Everything you see is grown at my family's own Hollyfrost Farm. Fresh and filling.
"I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, Wuunferth, pays us to plant a little Nightshade. Who knows what he uses it for?"
"Hey, could you deliver this bottle of Nightshade Extract to Wuunferth?"
Thanks.
Very well.
"Ah yes, the extract, good. Poisonous, of course, but it has its uses."
I suppose you want something for your trouble? Here.
You've done it! You've beaten him!
And yet...
He's no longer abusing the power of the Eye. I would've expected all this to stop.
Wait a moment... do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble thief?
Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature is no different than my own.
Who are you?
Captain. What should we do? He's not on the list.
Captain. What should we do? She's not on the list.
"Follow the Captain, prisoner."
Forget the list. He goes to the block.
Forget the list. She goes to the block.
Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero. But a hero doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne.
It's nothing. Carry on.
"As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the Eight Divines upon you, for you are the salt and earth of Nirn, our beloved...."
"Next, the Nord in the rags!"
"Next, the lizard!"
"Next, the Breton!"
"Next, the dark elf!"
"Next, the high elf!"
"Next, the renegade from Cyrodiil!"
"Next, the cat!"
"Next, the Orc!"
"Next, the Redguard!"
"Next, the wood elf!"
"To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy."
"We're quartered in the Hall of the Vigilant. Keeper Carcette heads Skyrim's branch of our order there, providing healing and justice as needed."
So be it.
(Crying)
Maybe you're right. I guess I just didn't want anyone to think I couldn't handle one Nord lass.
"On my honor, I won't bother Carlotta ever again."
What did you just say? All I heard was the sound of jealousy.
"Bold words, but true. Fine, you win. I'll pay the Argonians more coin."
They don't work now. Why should I waste more money?
"All right, all right. You sound like a damn Legion officer, but I get it. I'll give him a break. This better not hurt our quota."
I'm in charge of the smelter. Not you. So why don't you lay off?
"Fine. You sound like a priest of Mara, but I get your point. Tell him to forget about the gold."
A debt. Is a debt.
I guess you're right. A Nord shouldn't be so proud to turn down a kind soul's generosity. Tell Iddra I'll be fine.
No. I have my pride.
You're right. What would my forefathers think if they knew I wasn't paying my debts? Tell Haran I'll bring her the gold I owe.
And I told you I'd pay it when I'm good and ready.
The finest jewelry in all of Markarth.
Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
The bloodiest beef in the Reach.
You want a cut of venison or mutton? Of course you do.
"All right, prisoner. Eyes front. You're in Cidhna Mine, now. And we expect you to earn your keep."
"There's no resting your hide in a cell in this prison. Here, you work. You'll mine ore until you start throwing up silver bars."
You got it?
I said get down there. Now.
"You won't. The Jarl has ordered a life sentence for you. Get comfortable in the dark, 'cause you'll never see the sun again."
You'll pay off your debt to the Reach. Just work and you'll earn your freedom.
Good.
"Don't get smart with me. I'm in charge. You keep it up, I'll have your toes cut off."
All right. Open her up.
"Now, you. Get down there."
"This is a jail, owned by the Silver-Blood family. We use the prisoners to mine for ore."
"It's the most secure prison in Skyrim. Throw scum in, close the gates. No one gets out."
"So unless you're here to dig, you don't belong here."
We're not. The Silver-Bloods pay our wage. Every man here is a trained mercenary.
"Everyone, on me! The Jarl wishes to speak!"
"Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor!"
They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises!
"In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts."
The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt!
"But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire."
He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can.
...You! Why?
"And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught!"
"Well met, kinsman. What brings you to Whiterun?"
"Well met, traveler. What brings you to Whiterun?"
"Ah, so it's gold you're after, then?"
You need only ask about. Plenty o' folk in Whiterun with too much fat and gold to be bothered doing anything for themselves.
Truly?
"Ha! By Shor, this city could use more like you."
"Best head up to Dragonsreach, then, and see the Jarl. He's lord of Whiterun, and can set you on the path."
A pity. And words I hear too often.
"But there's no shame in it. One of them dragons comes callin' in Whiterun, the place'll go up like tinder."
"Aye, that I do. Have all my life. We Battle-Borns have been here since the beginning. Along with the Gray-Manes."
Our families been close as kin for generations.
"But Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising has divided us. Now seems we can scarce look at each other without comin' to blows. Petty and foolish, that."
"They're sayin' dragons have returned to Skyrim. Now that there, that's a real problem."
"Ain't sure if they're takin' on new members, but you should talk to the Companions. They're over in their hall, Jorrvaskr."
If by [QUOTE]work[QUOTE] you mean [QUOTE]testing your steel in bloody battle.[QUOTE]
"Ha! The most important question of all, that one."
"You'll want the Bannered Mare. See old Hulda, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead."
"But mind he bard, Mikael. Poncy little milk drinker, that one."
"Ha! The most important question of all, that one."
"You'll want the Bannered Mare. See old Hulda, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead."
"Ha! The most important question of all, that one."
"You'll want the Bannered Mare. See Olfina, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead."
Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands!
"Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you!"
For Whiterun! For the Empire!
Thank you for your role in all of this.
It'd be my honor should you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll make the necessary arrangements.
And any other abominations that prey on mortals. Vampires. Werewolves. Witches.
But the Daedra are the worst. Their callous disregard for our lives is abhorrent in the eyes of the God of Mercy.
Wise decision. The vaults in the Hall of the Vigilant will guard this against future temptation.
Stendarr's Light purify you of your ills.
Stendarr be with you.
The Vigil will be watching you.
None escape the Vigil. All come into the light.
Yes. Our order was founded after the Oblivion Crisis. We dedicate our lives to facing the threat of Daedra wherever they appear.
"You're bloated with disease. The Vigilant of Stendarr can help you, as long as you promise to never assist the Daedra."
I am Keeper of the Vigil here in Skyrim. We bring Stendarr's Mercy to the innocent and His Justice to the Daedra.
"You speak to a Vigilant of Stendarr. Cavort with any Daedra, and we will hunt you down."
"Wherever the Daedra hide, the Vigil of Stendarr will cast them into the light."
"Stendarr's Mercy be upon you, for the Vigil has none to spare."
"Walk always in the light, or we will drag you to it."
The suffering the Daedra cause will not go unpunished.
The Mercy of Stendarr does not extend to Daedra worshippers.
He is the God of Mercy. The patron of order and justice for all of Tamriel.
"We bring his compassion where none can be found, by cleansing all those who would offend his children."
They are profane creatures with no hope of redemption. They lure innocents to their deaths and corrupt the souls of all they touch.
And their heretical artifacts grant powers to mortals that wreak havoc across Tamriel. They must be destroyed or guarded to prevent temptation.
We'll pay whatever it takes. But we must have more swords for the Imperial soldiers.
I just can't fill an order that size on my own.
Why don't you swallow that stubborn pride of yours and ask Eorlund Gray-Mane for help?
Ha! I'd sooner bend my knee to Ulfric Stormcloak.
"Besides, Gray-Mane would never make steel for the Legion."
"Have it your way. I'll take the job, but don't expect a miracle."
"Do not forsake your heart, child, for it may one day come to surprise you."
Mara will always accept into her arms should you seek return to her fold.
"Always, child. Mara's mercy is ever-flowing."
"Are you prepared, then, to help bring the light across this land?"
I don't want to choose! They're both so amazing.
That may be the case.
"But she is as volatile as a sabre cat. One wrong word, and I've seen her turn on a man so quickly..."
Calcelmo? What about him?
What? You're out of your mind. That old coot's more interested in dead dwarves than anybody around here.
Don't talk such rot.
Think of him? He's an odd little man. Always poking around the ruins and wasting time in his museum.
Seems friendly enough. Obviously intelligent. Why do you ask?
"Please, stop wasting my time. You're embarrassing yourself."
Of course you were. Now stop wasting my time.
Well aren't you a strange one.
Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
"My father was rarely home, so it was my mother who actually taught me how to use a bow."
She always said composure was the key to a successful archer.
"If you can remain calm, even in the midst of chaos, your arrow will most likely find its target."
"OK, let's see what you can do."
Remember to stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows. I have some if you don't have any.
Aim for the middle target.
Here you go.
It's easy - stay inside the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
Now hit the target to the left.
My older brother took me out hunting a lot when I was little.
"At the time, it was difficult to keep food on the table, let alone have enough left over to sell at the market."
"So whenever we came across more than one deer in a single location, it was imperative we kill as many as we could."
"If you can learn to keep your composure and trust that each shot is true, then you should be able to quickly handle multiple targets."
"When I tell you to, try and hit each of the three closest targets in eight seconds."
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have eight seconds to hit each of the three targets. Draw string and get ready.
You did it! All three targets in eight seconds. Nice job.
"Here, take these. Looks like you're running low."
Great shot. Now hit the target to the right.
Shoot the left target.
Shoot the right target.
Shoot the middle target.
I think I've taught you everything I know. You might even be as good as me now.
Kind of scary if I think about it.
It was my pleasure. It's not often I get visitors out here. Let alone friendly ones.
Very funny.
Thanks for sticking around and keeping me company.
It was nice to finally meet someone out here who doesn't want to rob you or take off your head.
"I know it isn't much, but here, take this bow. It was given to me by my family. It's special to me, but brings back too many painful memories."
"Reputation, mostly. A lot of Khajiit turn to smuggling and thievery to get by."
A few bad apples spoil the bunch. You know how it is.
"Matter of fact, I do. They've been fair enough with me, far as I can tell."
And a Nord knows a liar when she sees one.
Head up the steps from the market an' look to your right. Can't miss it.
Don't even get me started on that lot.
"They put on airs like they're somethin' special. Sure, they've got money, but they ain't got a shred of honor between 'em."
Gray-Mane. Now that's a name fills you with pride. We've got roots in Whiterun. We've got history.
"The Jarl has put out a bounty on the dragon that's been terrorizing the countryside. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
A bit of jewelry for your journey home?
"Oh, thank Arkay. Please, take this gold for your troubles."
"Well, would you look at that! Argonian Ale! My thanks, friend. Here, take this here healing potion. I, er, [QUOTE]found[QUOTE] it in the temple."
Just... leave here! Leave us alone!
Begone from here! Get out of this orphanage! Help!Somebody help me!
"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Whiterun. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Markarth. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Riften. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Windhelm. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
"I knew it... Mercer sent you to kill me! Guards, there's an intruder!"
You cannot prevail against me. I will outlast you... mortal!
Thanks.
Very well then.
"About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard."
"They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts."
"By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again."
"This isn't over. I catch you sending one letter to General Tullius, I'll have you both executed."
No. Not really.
(sigh)
Arise! Arise and defend us!
Hmph. Plenty.
"I'd say we're prosperous enough. Most folk don't go hungry, if they're willing to work hard."
"The city's ruled by the Jarl up in Dragonsreach. That's the fortress, there, up on the tall hill."
"But you're probably more interested in Jorrvaskr, mead hall of the Companions. Their deeds of war and valor are... legendary."
"Yeah, these Khajiit make a living traveling the roads and selling their wares."
It's got to be tough. Skyrim's a hard enough land when you've got a roof over your head.
"Worst thing is, nobody wants them in the cities. Nobody trusts them."
"About the same as everyone else. They're the cat-folk of Elsweyr. Great warriors, good traders."
"Way I hear it, Elsweyr ain't nothing like Skyrim. It's got tropical forests and dusty badlands. It sounds awful!"
The heat of battle is the fire that forges the strongest blades. It's an old Nord proverb.
"That, and a true Nord never misses a chance to test her worth."
You been talking to those Companions?
"[QUOTE]Too hot-headed,[QUOTE] they cried. Weak, pathetic cowards, the lot of them!"
It wasn't my fault! I told them over and over that it was an accident!
"They wanted me to prove my worth, so they threw me up against a young whelp of a lad, hardly old enough to grow his first chin-hairs."
I guess they thought a woman wasn't strong enough to hurt him. I didn't mean for him to die! Why would I want that? I just... lost control.
"I am an artisan, painting in strokes of blood red upon the canvas of life. But yes, I will take coin to fight at your side."
"After all, where is the value in creating art if there is nobody left alive to see it?"
"Lost, stranger?"
"Looking to practice, stranger?"
Try and hit the middle target.
Ready to practice some more?
Let me know if you want to try again.
Try and hit the left target.
Try and hit the right target.
Great job hitting those targets. You definitely surprised me with your speed and composure.
"It's not often I get visitors out here. You lost, stranger?"
Try and hit the far target.
Let's see if I can teach you a few things about using a bow.
"Remember, composure and speed. You don't need to see your arrow hit before moving onto your next target. Trust your shot is true."
"Take care, stranger. Be careful out there."
Shoot the far target.
It was nice to spend time with someone who enjoys archery as much as I do.
"Well, let me know if you ever want to practice."
You chose the wrong girl to mess with.
Nice shot! Right on target.
Now hit it again.
Let me know if you want to practice some more. Next time we'll make it a little more challenging.
You need to stay inside the boundaries.
Only use the practice arrows.
Stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
Shoot the right target.
Shoot the left target.
Shoot the middle target.
Two Imperial drunks who thought they were above the law.
Don't be like them. Don't feel sorry for me.
Nice job hitting those targets.
Excellent. Follow me to the targets and we'll begin.
"One, two, three..."
Go!
Time's up! Better luck next time.
"Here, take these. Looks like you're running low."
Listen to me and you might learn something.
Sure.
Enough! Stop!
Cease fighting. It's over.
Sir...
It's over. No more violence.
"We surrender. The capital is yours. If you pledge no harm will come of my people, I turn over the seat of power to you."
"Go. Tell your commanders you have won. I, my family, and my men will be gone before they arrive."
There is no point in further talk. Go now!
We've got to bring it down!
Don't let it get too close!
We've got to ground that bastard!
Come on! This is our best chance!
Attack while it's landed!
"Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch."
For the Blades!
I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!
"It's to be a real fight, then. Good!"
My lord Alduin requires your death. I am glad to oblige him.
I see that mortals have become arrogant while I slept.
My Voice has been silent for too long!
Hiding will not save you!
"Dohaviin, your Voice is no match for mine!"
Your Voice is strong... for a mortal.
"Come and face me, then!"
"I do not fear you, Dovahkiin!"
Take that thing down!
I hope so. But you'll forgive me if I don't assume that something's true just because the Greybeards say so.
"I just handed you the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Does that make me Dragonborn, too?"
Good. Good. Now we won't have to spend time searching for it.
We should get moving. There's no time to waste.
I need to get into my traveling gear. Give me a minute and I'll be ready.
I can't wait around for you to make up your mind. I'll meet you at Kynesgrove. Don't waste time getting there.
Why didn't you say so earlier? At least now we don't have to waste time searching the area.
We should get moving. There's no time to waste.
"Aye, he does indeed... and with his fingers in the East Empire Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt."
"If I'm not being clear enough, that means we don't want him killed."
"For now, just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot."
"No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything."
It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.
My wife Seren and I run it together. She still smiths even though we found out she is with child.
Our son or daughter isn't going to get much Redguard culture here in Skyrim. I know my wife worries how she will pass along her traditions.
"Hey, if you find a book called [QUOTE]Night Falls on Sentinel,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? It's a story from my wife's people. Be good to have."
Work? I demand tribute before you can be considered for any real tasks.
"How about drink? None of that local piss. Real Black-Briar Mead, fresh from Riften."
"Before my ma and da passed, I told them that one day, I'd become the best trader in Skyrim."
"I met one of the caravan leaders, Ma'dran. He said he'd help get me started if I could bring him a mammoth's tusk. Easier said than done."
I picked up the trade when I was a girl. One of the temple healers staying here on a pilgrimage showed me the basics.
"She had a book with her, [QUOTE]Song of the Alchemists,[QUOTE] that I used to read over and over. I miss having a copy."
That I am. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing.
Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking.
Ever seen a book called [QUOTE]The Mirror[QUOTE]? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work.
"Our little girl died recently. I've been shouldering my days with strong mead, but nothing gives my Tova peace."
"I've been looking for an Amulet of Arkay to remind my wife that our child is with the gods now, but I can't find one."
Good on you.
You better. I hate people who waste my time.
"You'd do that? If you find one, I could teach you a thing or two about trading. Help you get a fair bargain in the future."
Really? I'd be happy to show you a bit about herbs if you find the book.
Good on you.
Thank you.
"My loss, right?"
Then I don't have time for you.
I'll do my best.
I suppose it is.
Be glad you're not training under me with that mouth of yours.
Aye.
"Good. I'll see if I can get some copies made for the men. Here, something for your trouble. The Legion thanks you."
It's amazing how much you can learn from a book.
Here. Let me show you some of the things the temple healers taught me about potions.
"Don't know what the Redguards see in books, but this will make my Seren happy."
Thank you. Let me show you some tricks around the forge.
Now that's what I like to see. Someone who gets things done.
Here. A little something for you.
"Thank you. This should turn that old cat's gaze. Maybe I'll be able to become a caravaneer myself, one day."
"As promised, let me show you a thing or two about bargaining. Don't want some shifty merchant giving you a raw trade."
I hope Arkay grants my wife some comfort. Thank you. Here. I always pay my debts.
"Ah, a test subject! Go, my pets! Attack!"
"That bard Mikael is begging for a dagger up against his throat, the way he goes on about me."
"I've heard him boasting at the Bannered Mare, saying he'll [QUOTE]conquer me as a true Nord conquers any harsh beast.[QUOTE] Hmph."
Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. I wish someone would beat the coin out of his fat fists. He clings to every Septim.
He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a [QUOTE]proper Nord worker.[QUOTE] My people are not slaves!
He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us.
"They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical."
"Too many drinking games, too many bets, and I'm too old to ever raise the coin on my own."
He's been in Kynesgrove forever. Great storyteller. Keeps everyone's spirits up.
"Owes me a lot of coin for drinks. I keep telling him not to worry about it, but he's got the stubborn Nord blood."
"Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again."
"He owes this tavern enough coin to burn it down, build it back up, then burn it down again just for laughs."
"He's had some troubles in his life, but I can't have him drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin he owes."
He's a stubborn oaf. I don't know what good it'll do.
"If you want to try, go right ahead. I don't think anything will get through that thick skull of his, though."
"You can try, but we've gotten nowhere talking to him ourselves."
You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it.
"If you could convince him that I don't care about his tab, it'd certainly make me feel better."
Go right ahead. He just might be sober enough to listen to you.
I'm sure. I'm sure.
I can take care of myself. A Whiterun woman learns how to handle a few idiot men early in life.
We will make do somehow. We always have.
Sorries don't help anyone.
"He'll be fine, I just hate worrying about his worrying."
I'm sure we'll get our gold at some point. Not like he has anywhere to go.
Anything for my favorite lass.
"Oh? Were you after her yourself? I won't stand in your way, my friend. You have my word."
"Carlotta put you up to this, didn't she? I'm sorry, but that fiery widow is mine. She just doesn't know it yet."
"Well, my friend, if you think those boots needs more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them."
"Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers."
What? Are you telling me how to treat my workers? Do you have any idea how much metal the Silver-Blood family wants us to smelt?
"Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do."
"I guess if you're telling me to stop worrying about it, maybe I should just let it go. Thank you, friend."
"What do you think I am, a beggar? My family has always paid back every single coin we owed, going back to Tiber Septim's time."
Who are you to say what I should do? I'll pay her back when I'm ready.
"Bribing me? Well, a bard does need to eat. On my ancestor's honor, I won't trouble sweet Carlotta again."
I don't think so.
"Paying the wages yourself? Well, I won't say no to gold. By my family's honor, this money will go to the Argonian workers."
What future?
I guess I can spare him a few beatings. Deal.
The only thing I understand is you bothering you.
Works for me. Tell Octieve the debt's settled.
Don't think so.
"A true Nord would settle it himself, but at least this way Iddra gets her coin. Thank you. Tell her I'll be fine."
"This isn't about me paying Iddra back, this is about me being able to pay her back with my own coin."
I won't say no to that.
I'm not about to take on debts from some milk drinker I don't know.
"Whoa. Hey there. I didn't mean to make you upset. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me again."
"Easy. Maybe I was being too harsh on them. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, they will be paid fairly. You have my word."
"Wait. You win. I'll ease off on the beatings, just leave me alone."
Think you can mess with an Orc of the Reach? Let's go.
"All right, all right. Have it your way. Tell Octieve to forget about the debt."
"What? No. All right. I won't worry about the coin anymore, just stop giving me that look."
"Calm down there, friend. I'll pay! Tell Haran that she'll have her gold."
"Wasn't your business, anyway."
Already have.
That's what I thought.
Idiot.
It's better that way.
That's what I thought.
Really? You convinced that lute player to stop chasing me?
"I'd thank the gods, but I'll settle for thanking you. Here's some coin for your help."
You talked Torbjorn down? I'm impressed.
"Here, I was saving this for a rainy day. Maybe now I can afford a few more for my people. Take it."
"I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us. Here. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin."
"You've done a fine thing for me. You know, I used to be quite a warrior in my day. Let me show you a thing or two."
It'll be good to not have to hear him whining about his debts.
Roggi pawned a few of his things back when he still had things to pawn. Take them.
"Thank you. He's not a bad man, just bad with his coins and his drink. My husband Dagur could tell you stories, there."
I have a couple of Ranmir's things that he traded to us back when he was still paying regularly. I say you've earned them.
How about a test? Your muscle against mine. The victor gains 100 gold coins from the loser.
"I'm drunk, and it's been a while since I had a good fight."
"A hundred septims says I can take ya, bare-handed."
"And why not? I could beat anyone in this city, bare-handed."
A hundred gold says I knock your hide to the ground.
Don't like it? Too bad. This is our city. Ours!
Don't think I can take you? One hundred septims says I can punch you back where you came from.
"Want me to prove it? I bet a hundred gold I can take you, bare-handed."
This will be good training. Let's go!
You're short on coin.
That's the spirit! Let's go.
"Hey, I may have had a few, but I can still count. You don't have a hundred septims on you."
"Just fists. No weapons, no magic... no crying. Let's go!"
Why don't you come back when you actually have a hundred gold?
"All right. Fists only. And none of that magic stuff, either. Let's go!"
I said a hundred gold! Damn broke elves and damn broke elf-lovers.
Just your own two hands. Weapons and magic are out. Now let's see what you got!
Come back when you have the coin.
Soft. Just like all outlanders.
Pfft. Snowback.
Milk drinker.
Pit bait.
Milk drinker.
"You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip."
You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?
"You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue."
"You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip."
"Oh, well, it's just... I never imagined the Gourmet was a Khajiit. You know, because of all the fur, and the potential for getting hair in the..."
"A lofty goal, to be sure. And what brings your search to our doorstep?"
"It's true, the scrolls are a subject of interest to us, and work has been done to learn of them. But outsiders are not allowed within the College."
I'll take a bottle of spiced wine.
"I haven't known you to drink before, Ataf."
"A bottle of spiced wine for ya, Ataf?"
Viarmo is trying to get Elisif to allow the Burning of King Olaf. I don't want to look like I don't know how to drink in front of the other bards.
No thank you. I'm still feeling sick from the festival.
Ah a few bottles of Spiced Wine should hit the spot.
Of course. And I'm sure it's mostly for ceremonial purposes.
Plenty of ways to worship the Divines as you know.
Not fair. You're well aware I can't seem to get warm here.
"A bit of warming wine, Illdi. You know you can't resist."
Do you know I look forward to Burning of King Olaf each year just because of the fire?
Are your sales going well?
I hope the Divines have been keeping you well.
Not too bad. A few of the guests from the upcoming wedding have placed orders.
They seem to when you're around Silana.
It should be quite the affair. Nice to have something happy in the midst of the war.
Vittoria is practically glowing.
I went out ice fishing a few days ago.
"Brave man, with the Blackbloods out there. Did you catch anything?"
"Naw, mostly just froze."
"Well, keep at it. The fish have to get to know you before they're willing to bite."
Spiced Wine for the Winking Skeever?
Actually just a bottle for me today. I'm thinking of giving it to Vivienne.
"Sure, Sorex. Just like you did the last one."
The last one was warm up.


Get out of my face.
Watch out some gray-skin doesn't pick your pocket.
"Talos protect you, friend."
"Farewell, then."
I enjoyed our talk.
"Until our next meeting, honored friend."
May Talos shield you from all harm.
May Talos bless your days.
Blessings of Arkay be upon you.
Too few remember to honor the god of the dead. Do not be one of those.
The Divines smile on a charitable soul.
Don't forget them who's less fortunate than yourself.
Thank you for your custom.
"I'll see you again soon, I hope."
"Enjoy your stay, and don't break nothin'!"
Mind you don't put out that candle on the hearth upstairs!
"Be careful! That murderer could be anywhere, and anyone."
"The streets are safer now, thanks to you."
"See you around, handsome."
"See you around, my beauty."
A word of advice -- don't buy discounted armor.
"If you've need of weapons or armor, come back and see Oengul."
May the earth beneath your feet be always soft.
"I hope we will speak again soon, marsh-friend."
"Trust me, marsh-friend, you do not want to live in this city."
I would not complain if you returned with some Skooma.
Fair winds and calm seas. That's an old sailor's parting.
It was a pleasure to talk to someone so interesting.
Travel safely. It's dangerous out there.
"If you'll excuse me, I must return to my duties."
Do come again!
Very well.
May you lose yourself in the pages of a good book!
"As you travel Skyrim, make sure you stop and take in the view from time to time!"
"If you need another drink, I'll be right here."
"Have a seat, there should be plenty of space."
Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with my daughter's death.
Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with the death of my wife and daughters...
Don't take anything for granted in life. Nothing lasts forever.
Be sure to stop by Sadri's Used Wares in the Gray Quarter.
"Take care, friend."
Sometimes the difference between life an' death is a swift steed.
"Sorry about the smell. It's a stable, after all."
"Whether it's armor you need or a new blade, come see me."
"If you meet anyone in your travels who needs good steel, send them my way."
"Strength and steel are well and good, but magic is the true power in this world."
"A strong sword-arm wins battle, but a keen mind wins wars."
"Safe journeys, sword-brother."
"Farewell, then."
A most pleasant chat. Until the next!
I bid you safe travels.
Be seeing you.
"Alright, then."
Good day to you.
"If you're not doing something you enjoy, then you're wasting your life."
I hope to see you again soon.
"If you have need of tonics or potions, come see me at my shop."
Watch yourself out there.
Battle reveals who a man really is. Remember that.
Keep on your guard. This city can be a little rough for those such us.
It was a pleasure.
"I should have been an adventurer like you, instead of a farmer."
"Never trade a sword for a hoe, my friend."
Right. See you around.
"Aye, 'til next time."
"Then, as I've said, 1000 gold will be required to set things right."
I made it rather clear that a donation of 500 gold will clear it up rather neatly.
"As I've said, a donation of 250 should help take care of that."
It's most unfortunate that we need to have this discussion once again.
These matters are becoming more difficult to deal with. I'm going to need 1000 gold from you in order to make reparations.
I also hope that this is the last time we'll need to discuss this.
"Another incident? I must say, I'm disappointed."
I thought I made it clear that this sort of behavior is totally unacceptable.
It cannot become widely known that these sorts of things happen here. Work will need to be done to keep this quiet.
I think a donation of 500 gold on your part is necessary in order to put this behind us.
"Ah, yes. There was an incident, wasn't there?"
"Well, as this is the first time this has happened, I'll make it very clear that the College does not condone that sort of behavior."
"As an act of good faith on your part, I'd advise that you consider donating an amount of gold to the College."
"Strictly to cover damages, you understand. I believe 250 gold should be sufficient."
Yes. I hope this will be enough to maintain order.
"Once again, your suspension is lifted. Please try and control yourself."
Very good. I'll see that this is put towards getting things back to normal.
Consider the suspension lifted.
"Oh, excellent. I'll see that it gets where it needs to go."
"And I'll make sure the suspension is lifted. I'm glad we were able to clear this matter up, and I do hope we don't need to have this talk again."
You don't seem to have the gold on you. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding?
"Then I'm afraid your suspension will stand for now. I'm sorry, but that's the way it has to be."
"Come on, get up... I need you on your feet."
"I have no idea what happened. Ancano did it, I think."
"I don't see the Arch-Mage. He must've been blown clear. I need you to find him immediately, all right? Make sure he's safe."
"Get moving, now. I'll be fine."
"Come on, Arniel. Let's go."
Do we have to? They'd never lift a finger to help us.
That looks like it's the last of them.
We'll stay here. Get back to the College and let them know what's going on.
It's none of your concern. All you need to know is that we're paying for information.
"If that doesn't interest you, feel free to walk away."
"I can take a hint, lad. You want to make some coin, come find me."
"I can take a hint, lass. You want to make some coin, come find me."
Good luck with that Icewraith.
"Don't keep waiting, soldier."
"You have your orders, soldier."
I thought I gave you something to do?
Get those documents to Whiterun.
To Whiterun with you.
I want to thank you for your help. I know my master can be a bit short at times.
"Here, you should have this."
"Oh, I'm sorry about that."
"You don't think this is a war already? Sir, I..."
"Thank you, Legate. In the future, I'll let you know when your opinion is needed."
Sir.
How's the newcomer look?
He might just make it.
She might just make it.
Looks slow to me.
I could take him.
I could take her.
Not bad.
"Come on, now."
Come at me. You couldn't hurt me if you wanted to.
Don't just stand there.
What are you waiting for?
"Sahloknir, krii daar joorre."
"Ful, losei Dovahkiin? Zu'u koraav nid nol dov do hi."
"You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah."
Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Come back if you need steel.
We forge every day if you need anything.
Let me know if you come down with the Rattles.
Back to another fine day in Dawnstar.
"Stay out of trouble, now."
Don't bother me again unless it's important.
That's right. Home of the Redguards. The land of sand and seas.
"I hope one day I'll convince Rustleif to take us back there. Until then, I'm content running the forge together here in Dawnstar."
So it's true. That traitorous bitch! Morthal owes you a debt.
"Here. You were promised a reward for solving the crime, but I need one more favor from you."
"Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a master vampire I thought was destroyed a century ago."
I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.
By Ysgramor's axe! It's true. Morthal owes you a debt.
"Here is your reward for solving the murder, but I have another request."
"Unfortunately Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a powerful master vampire that I had assumed was destroyed."
I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.
Then stop wasting my time.
Did you see that candle above the fire upstairs?
"It was lit one hundred and sixty-three years ago, back when this building was the home of a grand warrior named Vundheim."
"When word came that he'd fallen, his son Deroct lit the candle in his honor. Nobody knows why it still burns."
One group has hidden out in the Reach.
One group has hidden out in Haafingar.
One group has hidden out in Hjaalmarch.
One group has hidden out in Falkreath.
One group has hidden out in Whiterun.
One group has hidden out in the Pale.
One group has hidden out in the Rift.
One group has hidden out in Eastmarch.
One group has hidden out in Winterhold.
"Get it back, for the honor of us all."
"Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Brother."
"Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Sister."
I don't see these troubles as business. This is a labor of honor.
"To bring Ulfric his rightful glory, I would hammer a thousand shields."
"Shor's bones, I might just have to!"
Every bit as sharp as what you'll find in Whiterun.
"I respect Eorlund, but he has the good fortune to work the Skyforge. Something about the fires... their steel just holds tighter."
"You know what I mean. Forges have personalities, right?"
If that makes any sense.
"For Ulfric? Oh, nothing official. Known him for years."
"He seems to value my thoughts, and I'm grateful for that."
"I don't really have a mind for war, and I think he likes having an untrained opinion from time to time."
"Grew up here. Colder as Atmora, but that just grows the beards thicker!"
Lot of history in these walls. We're trying to make some more. It's a lucky time to be alive.
"No, but then I don't have much need for Ulfric."
We both leave well enough alone.
Whatever I don't already know.
"Power is the crux of this world. There's always more of it to be had, if you look in the right places."
Are you kidding? I came all the way from Cyrodiil just to work with him.
"He's... he's not the best teacher. But just watching him, I've learned so much."
"It doesn't matter what I believe. Nurelion does, and it might be the only thing keeping him alive right now."
I'll carry on his tradition as best I can. I could spend a lifetime just going over his notes.
Every Nord should admire Ulfric. He fights for all of us.
"In fact, he's the reason I chose to learn the smithing trade. I want to make weapons and armor for the great Stormcloak army."
"Smithing isn't the most exciting thing for me, but we all have to lend a hand as best we can."
"If a Stormcloak uses one of my swords to strike down an Imperial soldier, then I've done my part to free our land."
"We work where we can get work. The Nords don't like unloading their ships, so we do it instead."
Sometimes cargo goes missing.
"I came here as a hatchling. The only thing colder than Skyrim is the Nords themselves, but we stick together."
"Wherever I can find them. If you're the type who worries over where something came from, you may want to move on."
There's an old saying that only a Nord can work the soil in Skyrim. I don't think anyone else would have the patience for it.
"It takes half a day just to dig a planting row in the cold, stony earth here. But what else can we do, eat rocks and ice?"
Just got here from the Summerset Isles. Lots of opportunity in Skyrim.
"That's right. In the Second Era, Tiber Septim himself led the army that conquered Old Hroldan from the barbarians of the Reach."
"Septim would later found the Empire that united Tamriel, but his first known battle and victory was right here."
And this inn has the very bed the great general slept in on his first night as Old Hroldan's liberator. As good as it was hundreds of years ago.
Pfft. I'm the oldest woman in Dawnstar. Was here when the Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger.
"He's a fool, if you haven't met him already. Thinks Ulfric Stormcloak is invincible and spits dragon fire."
The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand going up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the Legion.
"Seems Brina Merilis and the Legion came and now she's Jarl. That's a relief. I don't like the fighting, but Brina is the woman for the job."
"Aye. I've worked on a few moorings here and there for it. Most of the ship captains are superstitious about who works on their vessels, though."
"And Dawnstar is known for its bad luck. We're the last port of call before Windhelm, and the ore we trade makes rich targets for pirates."
Not much. I came here a few years ago from Hammerfell when I married.
"The land is beautiful, but I can't stand this cold. I don't know how Rustleif manages it."
My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil. I must have inherited their wanderlust...
"I joined the Legion to see the world. I know, that's one of those things people say, but it's completely true in my case."
Wasn't long before I saw more of the world than I bargained for.
Home? Home to me is a hot cup of ale at the end of the day and five minutes without someone needing something from me...
"Cyrodiil is a beautiful place, full of diverse peoples and histories. But so too, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and every other place I've been."
"Don't get me wrong, every country has its dark corners. But that's why we're here. To bring order and civilization, and to protect the people."
The life of a soldier is full of hardship. That's nothing.
But they send the Legion to places that've gotten too bad to be settled without violence. What's hard is seeing good people warped by evil.
And I've seen the face of evil. It was in the air above Sentinel on the Night of Green Fire.
For the glory of the Empire.
Ulfric and his thugs are stirring up trouble for their own agenda. The Empire is the only thing keeping the Dominion from walking all over Skyrim.
It matters little if some of the people here are ignorant to that truth. They are still citizens of the Empire. It's our solemn duty to protect them.
"Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to track down some refugee relatives who had fled persecution in Alinor."
Suddenly an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter. Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own.
"I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who where stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived."
"Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job."
We're supposedly at peace now. But I put in to be stationed here to keep an eye on the Thalmor. I've a feeling they're behind this unrest in Skyrim.
"Well, I don't know. Not yet... it flew over the town and landed on the old dragon mound!"
It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound.
"I don't know what it's doing up there, but I'm not waiting around to find out!"
My pa used to say there ain't no use worryin' about the things you can't change.
"If it's my fate to be ended by a dragon, so be it. Meantime, I'll live my life the way I want to."
"Been about eight years now. I used to be a mercenary, but one trip to Ravenscar Hollow cured me of that."
There's hagravens in that cave with talons like daggers. They'll open your bowels quick as a wink if you let 'em get close.
Creature like that'll make a man think long and hard about what he wants out of life.
Hmm... Your creature doesn't appear to be fairing any better than before. Methinks your aim is off.
You seem to be having a small problem... or perhaps it's a big problem? Maybe if you shrunk the whole thing down a little first?
Still can't wake him up? Perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree?
"Hello, Silana. Would you like an apple?"
Free of charge for you.
"That's generous, Jala, but I am happy to pay my way."
I'll need a whole crate of fruit. That Varnius Junius went through quite a few of our supplies.
The guy in from Dragon Bridge? He didn't seem the type.
You never can tell.
There's nothing quite like a good vegetable.
Vegetables are the food of the Divines.
"I've heard stanger things, are eaten over at the Temple of the Divines."
I keep coming out here thinking I'll see what others see in this... frivolity.
Your a hard woman to please Una.
"I'm pleased when the palace is clean, I'm pleased when the beds are made on time, I'm pleased when I Erdi isn't around."
Most of those don't happen very often.
I like you Una. You've got presence.
You like everyone Jorn. You'll make a good court bard some day.
I don't think that was a compliment.
Sometimes I like to think my cooking is like playing the flute or singing a song.
"I've tasted your food, Odar. It's better than most songs I've heard."
How do you put up with that fop Fihada?
I once saw Fihada put an arrow in between the eyes of a Blackblood Marauder at five hundred paces.
You don't put up with a man like that. He puts up with you.
Thanks. Papa talks about it some. Mum doesn't say much since Uncle Roggvir died. She doesn't even go to Temple anymore.
I wish she would. At least that way she'd have people to talk to.
You would do that? That's great. You should go do it right now.
"Yeah, that's what papa says too."
"She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later."
Well. I wish it were that simple.
"Maybe it is. Look, I want to go back but I won't feel right in there without a tie to Talos."
My brother Roggvir wore a symbol of Talos. He kept it hidden on his person. If I had that...
I can't go near his body. Would you get it back for me?
"Why did you... nevermind, it's a sign. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your help."
Thanks.
Thanks so much. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your time and effort.
"As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place."
"My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed."
The marsh is treacherous. You would do well to not wander at night.
Slow? No. It just ain't there at all.
Few enough reasons to pass through Morthal before the war started.
"Now... Well, let's just say the front door doesn't get much use."
Lurbuk?
"Fancies himself a bard. He pays, so I let him stay."
"If I had any customers, I'd be worried about him annoying them. But, well... Look around."
"No, no. Well, sometimes, but that's not the problem."
"I just often don't have much to do, so I tend to... I try things out. They don't usually work, but I try."
"Next thing I know, I've used up most of my stock."
Lock the city gate.
Positions.
Your fruit are looking a little less ripe today.
Your selection looks very delicious. I'll take an apple.
It's those damned Blackblood Marauders. They're scaring off shipping.
One apple. Since the Blackbloods were dispatched I've had good luck getting shipments.
I could listen to him play all day.
I could listen to her play all day.
He's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
She's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
Speaking of harsh.
You Bards don't cut each other any slack do you?
Not in our nature.
Do you miss your days training at the College?
Absolutely not. I prefer to be near enough to come visit but free to come and go as I please.
"Well, you can understand Elisif not wanting it."
I'm so glad we got to have it. I thought for sure Elisif would never consent.
It's too bad the Burning of King Olaf was called off this year. I think some of the younger bards would really have gotten a kick out of it.
I think our flutist here has gotten better since the Burning of King Olaf.
It is a shame though.
I think I may wait until the Burning of King Olaf to have and Spiced Wine.
You and everyone else. Word is it may not happen this year though.
"Oh, no. But being surrounded by good music, good drink and good friends is all I've ever asked for."
"Generally, if you want rumors, you should talk to Corpulus. That said... I did see a visitor pass through on his way to the Blue Palace."
"Um, excuse me. Could I buy two leeks."
"Fine, Ataf. You should eat some more tomatoes, though."
My mother always used to say that too.
Perhaps you could spare a tomato for a priest of the Divines?
"Perhaps if I were a little more blessed I could afford to give away my fruit. As is you'll have to pay, Rorlund."
How about I trade you a song for some fruit?
"You don't need my fruit, I've heard when you sing people throw tomatoes at you anyway."
You're really going to the Blue Palace? That presents an opportunity.
If you were willing to wear one of Radiant Raiment's outfits and speak to the Jarl I would not only pay you but let you keep the outfit.
Good. Here's the outfit. Try to get Elisif's opinion on it and if she likes it mention it's from Radiant Raiment.
Look silly! As if you could look any sillier than you do now.
It's quite fetching actually. The craftsmanship is excellent.
Oh really? Well you can tell them that I will be putting in a request for a few dresses quite soon.
"If you are here to purchase, I have many spells available. Do come in."
Welcome. There are many things here that cannot be found elsewhere.
"Good to have a customer! You need food or drink, you say the word."
"Always good to see folk come back for more. You need a drink, you just let me know."
"It's down the stairs, dear. Just come right in."
"Oh, do come in! I hope I have what you need."
"The Mortar and Pestle makes potions, if you can't tell from the name. Just step up to the counter."
"I'm kind of busy, but if you need any potions or ingredients, let me know."
I'll be over here if you need any potions or ingredients.
"Hello there, can I pour you a Black-Briar Mead?"
"Ah good, back for some more Black-Briar mead, eh?"
"Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. Come on in, take a look around."
Welcome back to the Prawn. Let me know if you need anything.
Let me know if you see anything you like.
"Take a good look around. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. If not, let me know, I might have it stored away."
Got something for just about everybody in here. Give a holler if you have any questions.
Good to see you. Come on in.
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
Hello friend. Make yourself at home.
Can I help you?
You lost?
"I trust you're not planning any trouble. What can I do for you, friend?"
That's wonderful. You've done us a great service. As promised the outfit is yours and here's something for your trouble.
"Hail, friend! It's good to see another merry soul enjoying this fine day."
"Ah, but you look tired. Come, share a bottle of Honningbrew Mead with me!"
"You've never had a taste of sweet Honningbrew? Why, it's only the finest mead outside of Sovngarde!"
Its sweetness is like a fair maiden's kiss on a starry night. And it's got enough kick to put a frost troll on his hind quarters! Ha!
But enough talk. Come! Won't you share a drink with me and my companions?
"Ha, nothing like fine spirits to help raise your... well, your spirits!"
"Cheers, my friend! May your adventures find you fame and fortune!"
Black Briar? How dare you shove that swill in my face. I'd rather drink mammoth drool!
Black Briar Mead? What are you trying to do? Poison me?
Ysmir's beard! You're one after my own heart. I would love another bottle.
"This good deed should not go unrewarded. Here, take this!"
"Ah, is there any way you'd rather spend the day than drinking Honningbrew Mead?"
Drink Honningbrew Mead with a wench on each arm? Ha ha!
"I'd rather have two bottles of mead then two wenches, friend."
Why's that?
The meads won't argue your ear off about which one should go first!
"Ha! Too true, my friend. Too true..."
I don't talk to people who drink that Black Briar drench.
"The memories. I cannot stand them. You must take them away, return them to Avanchnzel."
You must take the Lexicon from me. Please... take it now.
"No, you don't want to go up there! A dragon... it's attacking!"
I'm not going out there. Not with that dragon on the loose.
I wouldn't go out there for all the money in the world.
Do you think it's gone yet?
Don't you know there's a dragon attacking?
We've got to find someplace to hide!
Wait. Something's wrong.
Come on. Hurry. We might be too late.
"Dibella, guide us."
Lead us to your Sybil.
"My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty."
"Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them."
"As you command, my lord. But, the issue could be solved another way."
"If we spend less on new arms and armor for the guards, for example..."
"We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten?"
"Whiterun is the crown jewel of Skyrim, and you would leave us defenseless?"
"I'll be glad to help you. There are many ways to improve your home, provided you have the coin."
"And of course, don't forget to consult your Home Decorating Guide for descriptions of the decorations you can buy."
"Now, what would you like to purchase?"
You've already purchased every available improvement. I'm afraid I have nothing else to offer you.
Splendid! There's a house available right now.
"The house I mentioned earlier is still available, if you want to buy it."
Wonderful! Here is the key to your new home.
"Very well, just let me know when you're ready to purchase the house."
"Very well, just let me know when you have the necessary funds."
Is there anything else you'd like to purchase?
As you wish. Speak to me again if you decide to purchase some decorations for your home.
"I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough gold to pay for that."
"Very well, I'll make the arrangements. The next time you visit your house, your new furnishings will be in place."
Waiting for what?
No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.
"Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it?"
Took an incredible amount of work to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it.
"Place the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process for focusing it."
"When he shows up here and vouches for you, then I'll see what I can do for you."
Closest town from here is Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he'd help you out.
It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.
"Listen, you should go to Solitude and join up with the Imperial Legion. We could really use someone like you."
"And if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one who can stop them."
We need to talk.
I think you're looking for this.
That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.
"Kynesgrove is this way. We can travel together or split up and meet there, your choice."
Someday I'm going to kill a dragon all by myself.
"I'm eleven years old, and I could take you."
Aav uv dir. Join me or perish with your mortal friends.
Ruth wah nivahriin joor!
Use Dragonrend! It is the only chance to defeat him!
He is too strong on the wing! Bring him to gol with Dragonrend!
"Use Dragonrend, Dovahkiin!"
"Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!"
Use Dragonrend! It is the only chance to defeat him!
He is too strong on the wing! Bring him to gol with Dragonrend!
"Use Dragonrend, Dovahkiin!"
"Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!"
"Now, Dovahkiin! Now he is vulnerable!"
"This is your chance, Dovahkiin! Strike with all your force!"
Hurt him while he is grounded!
You have it. The Kel - the Elder Scroll. Tiid kreh... qalos. Time shudders at its touch.
There is no question. You are doom-driven. Kogaan Akatosh. The very bones of the earth are at your disposal.
Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound.
Do not delay. Alduin will be coming. He cannot miss the signs.
Do not delay. Alduin must feel the tremors in Time by the Scroll's presence here. He will know what it means.
"Here, this is fresh. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow."
Here. Wouldn't want you going into a fight on an empty stomach. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.
A warrior marches on the gut. Here. This should give you strength. I'll cook another tomorrow.
Here. This is from a recipe my people have passed on to me. I can cook another tomorrow.
"Here you are. I added a little mead into the recipe. I think it tastes better. Let me know what you think tomorrow, I'll make another one."
"I should be asking you the same question, but all right. I'll cook. Here, try this, and don't you dare ask for another one before tomorrow."
I can. Here. This is fresh. I'll have another one made tomorrow.
"C'mon, let's get something to eat."
"*Sigh*... and that's the last one. All right, enough of this."
Are you?
"Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it."
"Skjor was looking for you, earlier."
Degaine the beggar got himself kicked out the Temple of Dibella. Caused quite the ruckus.
"I'm not interested, Jaree. It doesn't matter how many times you ask."
"You might want to rethink that. You're missing out on some wonderful opportunities, working in that bar."
Some layabout named Sabjorn.
Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now.
Oh? Where?
Where are you thinking?
Where?
You want to move? Where?
I was just getting settled in. Where are we going?
Oh really? And where were you thinking?
And where would that be?
I'll get everything ready and meet you there.
I'll meet you there.
"I'll see you there, then."
Very well. I'll meet you there.
All right. I'll see you there.
"If that's what you want. I'll see you there, soon."
I'll see you there.
Our new home. I'll see you there!
Then I'll see you at home!
A home for the two of us. I'll meet you there.
It will be our little nest. I'll be waiting for you there.
"The two of us, living together. I'll see you at home!"
"I'll see you at home, then. Don't keep me waiting!"
"I'll be waiting for you at home, then."
"Goodbye, my love."
"Bye, love."
"Conquer your enemies, my love."
"I'll be here if you need me, love."
"You're going? I'll miss you, dear."
"Leaving? Take the world by storm, dearest."
"I'll be here, my dear."
We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has accepted our guidance.
"The same words were used to greet the young Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor Tiber Septim."
Ah. I sometimes forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as we are. This is a rough translation:
"[QUOTE]Long has the Stormcrown languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon.[QUOTE]"
"[QUOTE]By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old.[QUOTE]"
"[QUOTE]You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it.[QUOTE]"
"He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice, or Tongue."
"After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat."
He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice.
"He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory of men."
"Jurgen Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition, and the Way of the Voice was born."
The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods.
"If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh."
"We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals."
"That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood is itself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift."
Your destiny requires you to use your Voice - why else would Akatosh have bestowed this power upon you?
"If you remember to use your Voice in service to the purpose of Akatosh, you will remain true to the Way."
Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.
There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean that you are ready to understand it.
Do not let your easy mastery of the Voice tempt you into the arrogance of power that has been the downfall of many Dragonborn before you.
"Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed."
"I'm sorry, were you about to say something?"
We will see about this...
Hey! It's the bard-to-be.
We have guests as often as we can but there aren't a lot of travellers these days. The war keeps people off the roads.
We supply Falkreath to the south. Until recently we supplied Helgen.
Falkreath trades with the surrounding holds and without our wood they would have trouble keeping their prices low.
"Other people just make things complex. Out here, Hern and I can get everything we need from the occasional traveler."

I can't thank you enough for what you did.
The East Empire Company is in your debt.
Glad Orthus was able to find someone competent to help out.
You handled yourself pretty well back at Japhet's Folly. We'll remember that.
I'm going to make you sorry for this!
"Come on, give it your best shot!"
How could you possibly know about...
Please. My family means too much to me. Don't hurt them.
Wealth is my business. Help me out and I can add to yours. Would you like a taste?
"While I feel Ulfric's cause is just, my concern is for the people of The Rift."
How can they continue to lead their already meager lives with dark clouds looming overhead?
"My heart goes out to them. If only our coffers were deeper, I could protect them as they were my own family."
"With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat."
"Between you and I, I think his motivations are a bit more self-serving. He uses this holy war as leverage in order to pursue the throne."
"If he were to be crowned High King, I'm not so certain it would be the golden age his followers expect."
"With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat."
Many have died taking up arms for this cause. I fear that the land will be stained with blood for years to come.
Surely you're aware of the Great War between the Imperials and the Elves who called themselves the Aldmeri Dominion?
"When the smoke cleared, the White-Gold Concordat was signed... it was supposedly a treaty aimed at establishing peace within the Empire."
One of the terms of the treaty was the outlawing of worship to Talos.
"To the Stormcloaks, this was viewed as the moment when the Empire became unworthy of the allegiance of any true Nord."
Indeed. There have been multiple attempts on the Jarl's life. We're not certain if it's the Dark Brotherhood or simply Imperial sympathizers.
We've also had run-ins with spies attempting to probe our security for weaknesses. I work with the city guard to make certain they fail.
"At the end of the day, I'm the last line of defense for the Jarl. I will not allow her to fall."
"As long as she continues to keep me at her side, she can count on my blade to protect her."
"To be honest, I doubt someone would be stupid enough to make an attempt on Maven... sorry, Jarl Maven's life."
"But just in case, I'll be ready for them."
Not well I'm afraid. That Brynjolf... he keeps draining the people's pockets with his ridiculous miracle cures.
A few months ago it was troll fat salve and now he's got something new.
Not that there's anything that can be done about it. He's in good with the Thieves Guild.
"He's the protector of Man, the Dragon of the North, the patron of all Nords."
"And despite the Imperials and their treaty, he will always be one of the Nine Divines."
A devout Nord would rather fall in battle and have his blood spill upon the earth than allow the Empire to strike his name from the divinity.
Maven Black-Briar wants me to keep the mead flowing and that's what I aim to do despite all these lazy good-for-nothings that work for us.
Ever since I took over as the foreman the production of our mead has never been more profitable.
"And if the meadery is profitable, I get rich. Get the picture?"
Lady Maven could buy or sell anyone in Skyrim. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one pulling the strings around this city.
"She's always welcome in Mistveil Keep and between you and me, I'm pretty sure she even has some pretty influential friends within the Empire."
I'd also warn you not to cross her. She employs quite a few... troubleshooters  to take care of messy problems.
"Yes, I suppose someone has to be around here. Have you seen the condition of this sorry excuse for a city?"
"Beggars roam the streets, crime runs rampant and the threat of war is driving away business."
The paltry amount of coin that I place in the charity box at the temple is the least I can do to help.
Of course! I'd be more than happy to add a donation to our charity box.
"Right now, the best you could provide is coin. We need all the help we can get."
Thank you! I can promise you that this will be put to good use.
As you wish. Whatever you can afford will certainly be put to good use.
"People say I'm making gold off of other people's misery, but what else would I do? Smithing is all I know."
"Next time one of my shields deflects a killing blow, they'll change their tune."
Been stuck with the name for years.
"I've been ridin' horses since I was a lad... nothin' I liked more. But as I got bigger, so did my mounts."
"Then one day, I was drunker than I've ever been and mounted a poor colt. Broke his back in two. Haven't ridden since."
The moisture in the air is better for the ingredients. It isn't every day that you get your hands on fresh nirnroot or painted troll fat.
It also makes it easier to gather water when the canal is right out the front door.
"Besides, I also prefer the quiet. I didn't open this business for browsing. Come in, buy what you need and get out."
I've been adventuring across Tamriel since I was a fresh-faced young woman barely able to swing a blade.
"My travels have taken me from High Rock to Valenwood, Elsweyr to Morrowind and all points in between."
"I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up."
"Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content as things keep going our way."
A new chapter in the Thieves Guild is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.
"I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up."
I only hope we can restore the Guild to its former glory after all the damage that's been done.
"So, word has it you and Brynjolf know where Mercer's hiding. Good."
"Make sure you make him pay for what he did to Gallus... heck, for what he did to all of us."
"We're all behind you, friend. Do your best."
The word is that Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood.
"I can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before my time, but I still can't believe it."
You need to teach him a lesson... show him the penalty for betrayal around here.
"Look, I like you, so I'll tell it to you straight. Brynjolf and the rest are in the Guild, and they're ready to cut you down."
"I know you have a damn good reason for siding with Karliah, so I hope you can give it to them."
Everyone's been worried since you and Mercer haven't shown up in a while. Brynjolf even went out to find you.
Delvin and Vex have been running things for now.
I hope this all gets straightened out soon or I'm headed on the first caravan out of Riften.
Glad to hear Gulum-Ei got what he deserved. That lizard owes me big for a bad shipment of Shadowbanish Wine he tried to pass off on me.
Mercer's been storming around waiting for you to come back. I think he's finally figured out who's been messing with the Guild.
Never seen the guy so angry. Better help him out any way you can.
Maven was down here right before you got back and she was all smiles. Haven't seen her like that in a long time.
"Whatever you did at Honningbrew, you're now on her good side. Best of all, if she's happy, Mercer's happy."
Keep it up and you'll go places.
"Well, you did something Vex couldn't do at Goldenglow, so you're looking pretty damn good."
Word is that you found something while you were out there though... something that could be a problem for the Guild.
Just watch your back and do what Mercer says... he'll sort it out.
"I don't know about the others, but I sure am glad to see a fresh face down here."
The Flagon used to be packed every night with the boys from the Guild but now look at it.
Last few years have been pretty bad. I've almost closed this place up.
"I don't know you so we've got nothing to talk about. How about you finish the job Brynjolf gave you, then we can talk."
"Sure. How about you mind your own business about it, and I won't have to get Dirge to toss you into the cistern?"
It would be my pleasure.
Are you ready to go?
All aboard!
Let me know. We shouldn't stay here all day. My men want their mead.
There you are.

"Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth."
"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
Dah...
"You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you."
"Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready."
"Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau."
"I'll do anything if it means saving my brother. You'll join us, won't you?"
Thorald can't be left to those... monsters.
"Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here."
You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.
"Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple..."
Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards... I might be able to help you.
"Well, we can always use contributions."
You were ranting when you got here  but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.
Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up.
I don't think so. Clean up your own mess.
I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense.
"You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]"
You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out.
You said a whole lot of nonsense about selling Gleda to hire a priestess for some big event.
"There was a bit of talk about some staff you had in safe keeping. Never said where, but you sure didn't have it with you!"
"Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again."
Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.
"Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a note. The only bit that I could read said [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]"
That's all I know.
"Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda."
Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance. You spoke of her so glowingly.
I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.
I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is away as a joke.
You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that.
But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back.
You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!
I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you where the ceremony will be.
If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.
"All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober."
You said you the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.
You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.
"Well, I know the Companions make their home here. Their mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is the oldest building in the city."
"Oh, and there's a nasty feud between two families called the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns. You'll want to be careful there."
"The rest you can find out by asking the townsfolk. I'd start with the barkeep at the Bannered Mare, or the castle steward."
"It's an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of the Kings is ancient."
It's not the friendliest place for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in a slum called the Gray Quarter.
The Argonians can't even live inside the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks.
"Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse."
Solitude's been the capital of Skyrim as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first.
"Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company."
"If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at the Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate."
"You can get a room at the Bee and Barb, but mind your coin purse -- it's no secret the Thieves' Guild makes its home here."
"Oh, and if you meet Maven Black-Briar, stay on her good side. This is her city, and nobody else's."
Exploiting? What's that supposed to mean? Erik works the farm because he's a good lad!
"I'm not forcing him to stay here. I know that he wants a life of adventure, but I've told him before that I can't afford to buy him armor."
"None of 'em's older than nine, and the youngest is six."
"Now, the horse I got for sale is seven years old, but in fine health. She's got a lot of spirit, that one."
"We've taken to calling her Queen Alfsigr, or just Allie for short. I expect you can name her anything you like once she's yours."
"Another time, or not at all. It's really none of your business, after all."
"Father says I should pick a name that describes what I really am,  but nobody's going to hire Erik Greenthumb or Erik Hoe-pusher."
"No, I need a name that will put some fear in the hearts of my enemies. When I have some enemies, that is."
No! You will not deny me this!
No! The Eye is mine!
You cannot take this away from me!
"Return with the gauntlets, or not at all."
You have returned with the gauntlets! Enter. Speak to our chief right away.
"Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner."
"If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher, things will never be the same for the Guild."
"As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade."
"Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him."
"Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose something did we?"
"You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now?"
"You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor."
"Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your status to the same, Karliah."
"And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me again."
"My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your Grace."
Revenge? How interesting...
"Very well, the conditions are acceptable. You may proceed."
"If you wish to talk, I'll be here for a bit."
Proceed down the hall to the gate when you're ready.
"This way, please."
"Please hurry, we need to catch Mercer before he leaves Skyrim."
"Until next we meet, lad."
"Until next we meet, lass."
Best get rid of the ones we see. Just in case.
Wait!
A few hours sleep and we should be ready to continue through.
I can't do this. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.
This should compensate you for your find.
What a delightful find! This should cover it.
"It's worth quite a bit actually. Quite a catch! Here you go, this should make you smile."
"Must have come from Mercer's place. He'd admired the Gray Fox for some time. Sure, I'll buy it from you... here you are."
By the Eight... you actually got your hands on it! This alone is worth more than some thieves earn in a lifetime.
"Look, I've moved all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk and I'm barely scraping by."
I'm not out to win friends and I could care less if you're happy about your purchase or not. I just need the coin.
The sooner I get out of Skyrim the better.
"Are you serious? The war is tearing the land apart, the dragons have returned seeking who knows what... Skyrim is going nowhere fast."
"If I were you, I'd pack up and get out of here before you end up in one of those burial cairns."
There are those that believe the Jarl does nothing for this city... that it's corrupt and run by the Black-Briar family.
I can assure you that this is entirely false. We are fully in control of everything.
"Maven Black-Briar is the owner of the largest and most profitable business in all Skyrim, the Black-Briar Meadery."
"We're pleased to have her in Riften. She brings stability, opportunities for employment and strategic value to our city."
"Maven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the family, represents everything that's wrong with this city."
"She's bribed countless officials, has friends back in the Imperial City and freely associates with the Thieves Guild."
"I've tried everything I can to protect Riften's citizens from her family, but to no avail."
The Black-Briars have been instrumental in keeping Riften on the map.
"Before the meadery was opened almost fifty years ago, this town was nothing... a simple waypoint for those journeying on to Morrowind."
"Now, thanks to my mother's generosity, this city is making its mark."
"When speaking of the Black-Briars, only one thought should spring to mind. We are not to be trifled with."
"Help us, you end up rich. Cross us and you'll end up a memory. Is that enough information for you?"
Hmph. My family. All that wealth and they squander it on foolish ventures and political schemes.
I was meant for so much more than all of this... I wish to pledge my life and ply my talents in darker circles.
"If only my mother would let me, I would make her proud."
Wuld...
Nah...
Kest...
You must hear the Word within yourself before you can project it into a Thu'um.
Master Wulfgar will demonstrate Whirlwind Sprint. Then it will be your turn.
Master Borri.
Now it is your turn.
You've got no idea. Half the men in Whiterun have proposed to me. Some were even single.
They'll never understand. No amount of flowers or honeyed words are going to change my mind.
"Right now, all that matters is my daughter Mila. No man's going to get between me and my little girl."
"I can tell you're new around here, askin' a question like that."
"My husband Eorlund tends the Skyforge up at Jorrvaskr, the Companions mead hall. There's no finer smith in the nine holds."
You should ask him about his work. It's the only subject that'll get him talking.
"Well, that and maybe those stuck-up, dung-sniffing Battle-Borns."
Curse you for bringing up that bitter memory.
Not long ago it was my husband Eorlund. There was no finer smith in the nine holds.
Now he's dead and gone and the Skyforge of Jorrvaskr lies cold.
"Try Hulda, the innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market."
"You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help."
"Try Olfina, the new innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market."
"You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help."
"Why, because I'm a proud citizen of the Empire? Because the Stormcloaks only want Nords in Skyrim?"
The Stormcloaks can rot in Oblivion for all I care. I've lived in this city for twenty years. Twenty!
"That'll be the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. He's an honorable enough man. Never done wrong by me or my kin."
"Things are tough for him now, I'd wager. What with the fighting, and the dragons. But Balgruuf's a tough old Nord. He can handle it."
"Hrongar became the Jarl when his brother Balgruuf, who had the job before him, was murdered."
"Balgruuf was an even-tempered man, but his brother's a hot-blooded war-monger who wants to settle everything with a blade."
"If you've got some business with Hrongar, mind you stay on his good side. The palace dungeon's filled with folk who roused his temper."
"Vignar the Revered is the Jarl in Whiterun. I guess he was a great hero once, because the Companions all call him [QUOTE]Vignar the Revered.[QUOTE]"
"Is Vignar too old to be Jarl? It's a fair question. If he's grown infirm and is losing his wits, where does that leave the people of Whiterun?"
"Interesting, to say the least. What with all that's been going on."
"On the one hand, supplies are harder to come by, since fewer traders are traveling the roads these days."
"But on the other, the scarcity of supplies has led to some, well, [QUOTE]elevated[QUOTE] prices."
All that matters is that I have what you need. And it's worth every septim.
"Isn't it obvious? Why, the wonderful weather and hospitable people, of course!"
Not to mention my great fondness for dragons and petty political power struggles.
"Ah, but without a doubt, the most compelling feature of this frozen wasteland is the volley of inane questions leveled at me on a regular basis."
"Her name's Olda. If you've met her, then you probably already know what I'm talking about."
I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be.
"Hard to say. It's ancient, that much we know for sure. It was here long before the town itself."
I just hope the bridge survives the war. It's the only place you can cross the Karth river for a long way in either direction.
"Could be if one side wants to keep the other from coming across, they might try to knock it down."
"I grew up an orphan on the streets of Markarth. I'd have died there, too, but for the kindness of an old warrior named Logrolf the Bent."
"Logrolf rescued me and gave me enough money to get out of the city. I followed the Karth river north, and came here."
"When I met Michel, I knew this was where I belonged. I suppose that's it, really."
"Both the Imperials and Stormcloaks have sent riders this way, scouting the bridge and the lands nearby."
"They stayed at the inn, but didn't pay. They said soldiers don't need to pay because they're risking their lives to protect us."
"And that's not all. They took a heap of our lumber, and one tried to have his way with my daughter. They think they can do whatever they want."
"Of course. Every night I pray that we don't get a visit from a dragon, or that two armies don't show up to fight over the bridge."
"You ask if I'm worried? I'm terrified, if you want to truth of it. But I have to stay strong for my wife and children."
What are you waiting for? Get in there and find that mask.
Any progress on finding the mask?
Don't bother me if you haven't found anything about the mask.
"And what? You couldn't read it yourself? Fine, give it here a moment."
"Well then, what are you waiting for? Get in there and earn your pay."
Not to mention our pay.
"Besides, you're not scared of a few sleeping metal men. Are you, Drennen?"
"Properly controlled, it has knowledge enough to turn paupers into kings."
Sure.
Of course.
"The Legion's always been here. Without us to keep order, the provinces would fall into barbarism and lawlessness. Especially Skyrim."
"Take for example, Ulfric Stormcloak and his little [QUOTE]rebellion.[QUOTE] But rest assured, his days are numbered."
"I'm originally from Cyrodiil, sent here at the request of the Emperor himself. I'm often ordered to places with problems that need fixing."
"Now, while I'm certain this is all terribly interesting to you, I have important matters to attend."
Ulfric Stromcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.
I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now.
"Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt."
First we'll kick the Thalmor and their bloody Imperial puppets out of the country. Then we'll rebuild Skyrim into the land she once was.
"When we are done with that, we will take our army to the Dominion, and show those pointy-eared bastards not every man is fit to be their slave."
We're fighting because we're done bleeding for an Empire that won't bleed for us.
Untold numbers of Nords died defending the Empire against the Dominion. And for what?
Skyrim being sold to the Thalmor so the Emperor could keep his throne!
"We're fighting because our own Jarls, once strong, wise men, have become fearful and blind to their people's suffering."
"We're fighting because Skyrim needs heroes, and there's no one else but us."
"I killed Torygg to prove our wretched condition. How is the High King supposed to be the defender of Skyrim, if he can't even defend himself?"
"I challenged him in the traditional way, and he accepted. There were many witnesses. No [QUOTE]murder[QUOTE] was committed."
"True, he didn't stand a chance against me."
"But that was precisely the point! He was a puppet-king of the Empire , not a High King of Skyrim."
"His father before him perhaps, but not Torygg."
"He was too privileged and too foolish, more interested in entertaining his queen than ruling his country."
There hasn't been a true High King in Skyrim for generations.
"For too long he's been hand-picked by the Emperor, and given emphatic nods by milk-drinking Jarls addicted to Imperial coin."
It's time we had a real king. One of our own making.
"Indeed, Elisif has become Jarl of Solitude, historically and conveniently home of the High King, backed by Imperial interests."
But the Moot has not yet met to name her High Queen. And they won't. Not as long as I have any say in it.
"My father, the great Bear of Eastmarch, died during my imprisonment after the Markarth Incident."
"I, his only son, forced to deliver his eulogy via a letter I had smuggled out of prison. Such is the love of Titus Mede for his subjects."
"When finally set free, I returned to Windhelm, and was greeted by a city in mourning, at one with my own grief and anger."
"Clamoring in angry voices, calling out for justice, for war, they sat me on the throne."
The Throne of Ysgramor! The throne of my father...  I only hope I can prove worthy of the honor.
"Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but more importantly, it will prove your commitment."
Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your resolve.
I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me wrong. And I respect that.
"Now, if were done being sentimental, it's time for you to take the Oath."
Good.
"I see. Then there's nothing further to discuss. If you change your mind, speak with the Legate."
Good.
"I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar. What does bring you to me?"
"True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty man, but he's also a Nord that honors our traditions."
Keep your wits about you and you won't be harmed.
"And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing, I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun."
Yep. I have just one question for you.
"Light, medium, or heavy?"
"Light armor for scouting detail, heavy armor for full on combat, or something in between?"
"Alright... here you go. Should keep you light on your feet, and hold up decent enough if you wind up trading blows with the enemy."
"Alright. This here's enough to keep your insides from spilling out, except from the fiercest of blows, and shouldn't weigh you down too much."
"They don't make finer steel anywhere else. If this doesn't keep you from dying, nothing will."
"Now, that's it. One free outfit per soldier. You lose that, or get it banged up, you'll need to pay like everyone else."
"He's sending you after King Olaf's Verse then? That's good, we shouldn't leave it lying around now that I've figured out where it is."
"The Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Each bard adds to the Edda in his or her time."
And a very ancient one.
The verse criticized the reigning King Olaf. He was so incensed the bard was put to death and all the copies burned.
"At least, that's what we thought until I translated some ancient texts a year or so ago. We now believe King Olaf buried the truth with the bard."
"If I'm right Svaknir and King Olaf's Verse lie in Dead Men's Respite, along with the burial chamber of King Olaf himself."
I think Giraud here would give you the best explanation of both it and the history of King Olaf's Verse. You should speak to him about it.
Ro...
"This one would try a shop. You might prefer the direct route, hm?"
"Deathbell grow in the frozen tundra. You might nip into a mine for the ruby and silver. Vampire Dust is tricky. Vampires, you know."
"The vapors are waning, but not yet gone. Take a breath. Peryite will speak if He sees fit."
"Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded."
"Go, seek your fate. I will be watching, and perhaps we will meet again - afterwards."
"And yet you have done my bidding. Why, I wonder?"
"Embrace order and hard truth, mortal. Good bye."
Did you leave any alive? The Afflicted are mere vessels for my Blessing. It will spread to others through their touch and my own.
"Another Overseer will replace Orchendor, when the time comes. For now all is cleansed and ordered."
Go! Now!
Get moving!
Go!
Jump! Come on!
Get going!
Through the inn! Now!
You still here? Go!

Now let us see how quickly you can master your new Thu'um.
Yes. I think I am. You can Shout now. That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.
There's one way to find out. Try to Shout...
"According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do."
"Well, you can Shout now. You couldn't before, right? That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn."
There's one way to find out. Try to Shout... that would prove it.
"According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do."
"Now, now! That won't be necessary."
Hmph.
I'll be right behind you!
Spells have no effect!
I am beyond your pathetic attempts at magic. You cannot touch me.
The staff! Use it on the Eye!
Enough!
Still you persist? Very well.


Let's go on ahead. See if the way is clear.
I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
"All right, let's see if we can find a way out."
I better stay back and see to the old man. Good luck you two.
You will pay for stealing from me you eyeless freak!
I will take you down too. I am not splitting this horde with anyone.
We should keep moving. Still the draugr to worry about.
"Now let's move. I think that was the last of the Silver Hand, but still plenty of draugr for the both of us."
This looks like the guardian chamber. The key to that door has to be around here somewhere.
"[QUOTE]Every door has a key,[QUOTE] says Vilkas. Sometimes he is wrong, but look around anyway."
Good that you're so eager.
Good that you're so eager.
"Adrianne. At her forge, just outside."
"Place is named after her. [QUOTE]Warmaiden's.[QUOTE] It's a childhood nickname, given by her father. What I hear, she was playing with swords even back then."
"Anyway, our wares are strong and the prices fair. What else matters?"
"Since Adrianne's death, I've had to buy them from the Khajiit caravans."
"Tried making some myself, but I'm no good with the forge and anvil."
"Anyway, our wares are strong and the prices fair. What else matters?"
"Of a sort. I don't have formal training in the Restoration school, but... something just as good."
"Within these walls, I have all that I need to brew a potion for nearly any ailment."
"If I had a Septim for every case of Rockjoint or Witbane I've cured since I opened this shop, I'd be a rich woman indeed."
"Yes, I hear that question often."
My brother Anoriath and I came up with it one night after consuming... rather too much mead.
"After our drinks, we went out for a moonlight hunt. We got separated, and in his drunken state my brother mistook me for a deer."
"He shot an arrow that pierced my... well, my rump. After such a memorable adventure, we knew we had the name for our shop."
"Oh, yes. Hunting is my great passion."
"That's why my brother and I opened a shop to sell hunting supplies. It's the Drunken Huntsman, down by the main gate."
"He tends the store, and I've got this stall."
"In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power."
"That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that dragon's power?"
"Well, if you insist..."
Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.
"They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps."
"They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place."
I'd hardly call them a Guild. More like unorganized rabble.
"In fact, I wouldn't say they were a threat at all. No, our resources should be spent on preparations for invasion."
We're all eager to see them brought to justice. Maven Black-Briar has assured me that they're being dealt with appropriately.
"As one of our city's most influential citizens, she's has taken it upon herself to oversee their incarceration."
"Sadly, they're proving elusive but I have confidence that Maven won't give up until this city has been rid of them all."
Liars and bastards. Every one of them. I'd have their heads on a pike if it wasn't for the war effort.
All I need is a dozen men and we could march into the Ratway and burn them out like rodents.
Stormcloaks won't have it though. Too busy keeping the Imperial forces at bay.
They're vermin... garbage. They're exactly what makes this city such a horrible place to live.
How appropriate they should live in the Ratway with the rest of the trash.
They'd stop at nothing to take your last bit of food if that's all you had.
The Ratway's too good of a place for that scum.
"They used to be pretty feared around here. I mean, you'd whisper the name and it'd send chills down your spine."
"Now, they're nothing more than ruffians and thugs trying to pry a few extra coin from honest people."
All it would take is a small force of guard to go into the Ratway and flush them out.
It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting!
"If you fancy keeping your purse filled with gold and your head on your shoulders, I'd stay out of those awful tunnels."
Disgusting. Ruined sewers filled with goodness knows what.
"There's an entrance down by the canal, but I'd highly advise you stay out of there... its the Thieves Guild's territory."
Everyone knows the Thieves Guild uses the old sewer system beneath Riften as their hideout.
"I'd go down there myself, but that would leave Jarl Laila unprotected."
There are ruined sewer tunnels beneath the city. The only way I know how to get in there is through a door off of the canal.
"If I were you, I'd keep my feet dry and stay up here."
It's our name for the old sewers that run under the city.
It used to be a huge system hundreds of years ago but it fell into decay just like the rest of Riften.
"The Guild stocks the place full of thugs that aren't good enough to join, so watch yourself if you venture down there."
"I may be dark elf by birth, but I was raised Argonian."
"Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh."
I hope one day to find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that.
It doesn't matter. It's also none of your concern.
Just talk to him; see if you can convince him to give my amulet back.
"I told you, it's from my family."
"I don't... I know they always disapproved of what I wanted in life, to learn magic instead becoming a farmer, or a hunter."
"But no matter how poorly they may have treated me, they're still my family. I didn't consider that until after I'd made the trade."
Oh my. How precious.
"Onmund is too afraid to deal with me himself, and so he's sent you."
"I'll make this very simple for you. All my trades are final. Onmund knew this ahead of time, and went through with it anyway."
So there's nothing more to be said.
I've already made it very clear that all of my trades are final.
"Oh, I suppose. But you keep this to yourself; I don't want it being known that I go back on my trades. Understand?"
"Yes, you see, the thing is... I'm not concerned with [QUOTE]everyone's best interest.[QUOTE] I find I'm only concerned with my own."
"No, no. You're not understanding this."
"Onmund made a deal. He made that choice, and now he has to live with it."
"Look how persistent you are. It's charming, really."
Onmund gave up the first time I said no. But not you...
All right. I'll tell you a little story.
Let's pretend for a moment that a certain individual was looking to acquire a particular staff.
Let's also pretend that he traded some valuable items for said staff.
And it was only later that it was realized that this individual might... misuse such a staff.
The resulting disaster would reflect quite poorly on everyone involved. Are you following me?
"Yes, I thought we'd gotten past that bit already."
Onmund's amulet in exchange for my staff.
"You're not very good at this, are you."
"Look, I traded a staff to someone and found out later that was a bad idea. So, I'd like the staff back. Understand now?"
"Well, yes. I was completely unaware of the reputation of the other party in this trade."
I don't want that coming back to haunt me.
It's an entirely different situation. I don't expect you to comprehend the nuances of these matters.
"Regardless, I'm making you a very simple offer. You get me the staff, and I give you Onmund's precious amulet. Do we have a deal?"
"Finally, we have an agreement."
"I look forward to having it back soon. The sooner, the better, in fact."
"Oh, good. I was really afraid I'd lose it forever."
Pleasure doing business with you.
Ha! I didn't think he'd really give it back.
"Thank you, friend. It's good to know I can count on you."
"Actually, yes Arch-Mage. I believe there is."
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Solitude.
We've become aware of a problem in Winterhold.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Riften.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Whiterun.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Morthal.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Markarth.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Windhelm.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Dawnstar.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Falkreath.
"It would seem there's some sort of disturbance. From what few details we were given, it sounds quite familiar."
"I suspect that the power released by the Eye of Magnus was not fully contained, and has coalesced in this part of Skyrim."
I do hope you still have the Staff of Magnus someplace. I suspect you're going to need it.
There's another report of a disturbance in this Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
There's another report of a disturbance in that Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
Very good. I'm sure the Jarl will be quite pleased.
Pleased enough to justify the significant amount of gold offered to the College to rectify the problem.
"Excellent news. Were it to have gotten out of hand, it could have become a major problem for the College."
"Ah, excellent. Well, here's the gold the Jarl offered in exchange for taking care of the problem."
"Ah, excellent. Well, it's good to know that won't be a problem any longer."
Do you see that?
Some kind of resonance... you and the wall. It must be connected to the amulet!
I wonder... what effect might your spells have?
The Words wait.
Use Clear Skies to open the way to Paarthurnax.
Follow me. I will show you how to open the path to Paarthurnax.
Paarthurnax is the only one who can answer your questions about Dragonrend.
"I don't have any business with you, so get out of my face."
I can't talk right now.
Yes. Hofgrir took me in when I arrived in Riften about a year ago. He's been teaching me everything he knows.
"Horses are my whole life. Back in Hammerfell, I helped my family raise horses at our farm."
"I hope to open my own stables one day, but I think it's going to take a lot longer than I expected."
I owe a great deal of money to someone and I think they cheated me. I don't know what to do.
I was able to work out a deal with the stables in Whiterun to sell me some of their tack and harnesses.
"I borrowed some gold from Sapphire to pay for the shipment, but it got robbed before it even arrived."
"Now Sapphire wants her money back, and if I don't pay her, I think she's going to kill me."
"You will?! Oh, thank you!"
Not half as sorry as I am.
"They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire. Very powerful, very secretive."
"No one's seen them in well over a hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle of Artaeum."
I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.
And my Aunt wouldn't have to worry about her daughter.
But we must have the support of the other Jarls for that claim to have any meaning.
"Should they accept her rule, we will have peace."
Good man.
Good lass.
"If you're looking for truth instead, see Noster. He's a good example of what life has to offer."
"And if you're just looking to feel good, go get some Spiced Wine from Evette. But whatever you do, just leave me alone."
But you won't get any better than this from me.
"Well... okay. My father owns the Winking Skeever. But it's the family business, so it'll be mine when he kicks off."
My father owned it until he... passed on.
If you want something a bard can dig into look to the dragons.
"A thousand years from now Skyrim will have changed rulers dozens of times but the return of the dragons, that story is once in an era."
You will be my blood offering to Morvath!
Help me! A vampire!
"Please, someone help me!"
Another victim fell for our ruse!
Morvath will taste your blood!
"I thought I was a goner just now. Thanks for the help, and if you need any supplies I have a few to sell."
And who is this?
"It is no matter, this fool will be the next act of the show."
"I'm really getting tired of your excuses. When you borrowed the money, you said you'd pay it back on time and for double the usual fee."
I know I did. But how was I to know the shipment would get robbed?
"Next time, keep your plans quieter and nothing would have happened to it."
What? Are you telling me you robbed it? Why? Why are you doing this to me?
"Look, Shadr. Last warning. Pay up or else. All I care about is the gold. Everything else is your problem."
The pettiness of mortals. I had almost forgotten.
"I can grant you a powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of Dwemer make, capable of shielding you from both the spell and sword."
Return when the elf lies dead and it will be yours.
An impertinent question. The elf must die. Either carry out my will or do not. You are not the only mortal agent I could choose.
"Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the Afflicted, contains the festering wound."
"Orchendor and his Afflicted are meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with his Blessing."
"Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west, at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz."
"So you have, mortal. Go now. Kill Orchendor."
"Proventus, you must help me. We need to convince my brother to do more for the war effort."
"What would you have me do, Hrongar? Your brother is the Jarl. You know I can't question his judgement."
"I'm not asking you to defy the Jarl, just to open his eyes."
"Use subtlety and suggestion to turn his thoughts to the war. You're his steward, he'll listen to you."
"Leave me out of your intrigues, Hrongar. If you have something to say to the Jarl, say it with you own tongue."
"I'm so angry, I can hardly stand it!"
"Father promised me a new dress days ago, now where is it?"
"It takes a while to make a dress, Dagny. You have to be patient."
But I don't want to be patient! I want my dress right now! Father promised!
All you ever do is complain about what you want. You're a spoiled baby.
I'm going to tell father you said that. He'll tan your hide for sure!
"No, I openly welcome the presence of armed strangers who have no reason to care about any of us."
Of course it bothers me! I'm sure it's only a matter of time until they seize our mill in the name of their war effort.
"Next thing you know, there'll be more guards, and then we'll lose our homes as well. This is just the start of it, mark my words."
"My husband owns it, barely. He'll lose it soon enough. He's behind on his loan payments, but he drinks all his money away just the same."
"Now we're deep in debt, penniless and about to lose our sole source of income."
"Damn right it has. Demand's never been so high, at least not since I built the new mill."
"I think I would, if it weren't for my son. And my wife."
"Oh, Sayma would have my hide if I even suggested I might step foot on a battlefield."
You think Stormcloaks and Legionnaires are dangerous? Ha!
It's almost all I have time for these days.
"The men training here in Solitude and the troops out in the field, they all need weapons and armor."
These days? Aye. Most of what I make is for folk like you.
You should look into joining. They could use every hand they can get.
But I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
"There's still Imperial camps to be cleaned up, as you know. And that takes arms and armor."
"We mostly carry herbs and alchemical ingredients, that sort of thing. Before the war, our stock was mostly used for aromatic use in homes, yes."
"These days, we have more people like you coming in, looking for healing and the like."
"It's not an insult, just an observation."
"If I were walking around with a wound, I would want you to tell me to see a doctor."
Your outfit is something of an open wound... where attire is concerned.
"Not many people care, these days. The world is the worse for it."
No. That was an ugly affair. High King Torygg's death has turned the whole town on its head.
"And between you and me? He wasn't even that good a king. All of those rambling speeches about the Empire this, and the Empire that..."
Only when you're around. The rest of these fools I could do without.
"You'd think so, wouldn't you? I'm fine. Thank you for asking."
"It is when my customers waste time chatting, and not buying."
"I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere."
Every day the threat of exile from Riften draws closer for myself and my family.
Who knows how many spies the Empire has sent into our midst already. We're at war. This isn't the time for hospitality.
"Thank goodness mother is keeping a level head about everything. If my brother Saerlund had his way, we'd be flying Imperial colors by now."
Can you believe that fool had the audacity to speak of his love for the Empire in the plaza?
He expects us to drop our defenses and greet them with open arms... to dialogue with them rather than defend our homeland by spilling their blood.
"He's a traitor, plain and simple. Had I been sitting on the throne, he'd be hanging from the gallows for his sympathies towards the Empire."
Because I did something not a soul in this bloodstained house of war has the backbone to do... dared to speak my mind.
"I dared speak of the Empire and the lies that have been spread by Ulfric, the leader of the Stormcloaks."
Now my mother's stripped me of my heritage and incarcerated me here like a common criminal and my brother has all but disowned me.
"Be wary what you say around here, friend. You'll find not all take kindly to [QUOTE]insurrection.[QUOTE]"
Ulfric only cares about one thing... Ulfric. He's ordained himself the future High King of Skyrim and steps on anyone that gets in his way.
He's begun a rebellion against those that wish to eradicate the worship of Talos and uses it as his rallying cry.
"His cause may be true, but the man is a lie... all he holds in his heart his lust for the throne."
Exactly as I said it would.
"Now, are you ready to try again? I am confident it will work this time."
This will be worth it.
"Good, good. It'll be worth it, I assure you."
"Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?"
Well I really would like to make sure I've corrected what happened last time.
Please give me a chance to try again.
Agreed.
And thank you for your help. You're a good friend.
"Oh, no it hasn't. Let's be honest."
I have a long way to go before I'm ready for the kind of advanced magic I've been attempting.
"But at least I know where to start now. Thank you, you've been a great help to me."
I need your help with something. Something private.
"Yes, but it needs to be kept quiet."
"I may have entered into an... agreement with Enthir. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine."
"It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an amulet that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to Enthir."
But he won't deal with me. Talk to him; see what it'll take to get my amulet back.
"I hope you're enjoying the music, sir."
"I hope you're enjoying the music, ma'am."
These parties are a great way to earn a little extra money.
It's good practice. Most people barely notice what I'm playing.
I hope to get into the Bards College one day.
"I'm sorry, but I really can't."
Well. Anything to relieve the boredom. As long as it doesn't get back to me.
"I don't think so. Sorry. I would love to help you, but Elenwen can be very vindictive. I wouldn't want to get on her bad side."
"Sorry, but you'll have to find someone else to help you with your prank."
"Mmm, sorry. I really can't risk it. I'm sure you can find someone else with a little less dignity."
"Come, follow me."
"Watch that tongue, new blood."
Halt!
"You have no business here, so keep walking."
What are you looking at?
Leave me alone.
I've got to get out of here!
Have you reconsidered my idea?
"I haven't changed my mind, if that's what you're asking. I won't leave Whiterun defenseless, even for a day."
"If we send half our guards to aid the legions, just for a few days, it could tip the scales in the Empire's favor."
"The Companions can help protect the city, and the Emperor will be in our debt."
Have you lost all sense? We are short on guards as it is!
"If we lose half our men, the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves' Guild will have the run of the city. The Stormcloaks will be the least of our worries!"
"The answer is no, I tell you! Now stop pestering me with your war-mongering!"
"Very. I helped raise him. Oh, I could not have been more proud to see Torygg on the throne. He made a fine king. A fine king..."
I like to think I've aged well. I'm certainly wiser than I once was. And I know when one should speak... and when one should hold their tongue.
"I was, to my shame. The whole court was in attendance. I've seen much in my time, but that was a gruesome day."
Because Ulfric needed a symbol.
"Someone he could defeat that represented the Empire, the White-Gold Concordat, the banning of Talos worship."
"Torygg's father Istlod had held Skyrim together for nearly twenty-five years. When he died, Torygg became that symbol."
Ulfric showed up at the gates of Solitude requesting an audience.
We thought he was here to ask Torygg to declare independence. By the time we realized Ulfric was here to challenge Torygg... it was already too late.
"No. Even after Istlod died, the moot voted to make Torygg High King of Skyrim."
"But Ulfric was at that moot, continually talking about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason."
I don't think Ulfric knew how much Torygg respected him for that.
"If Ulfric had asked Torygg directly to stand up, to declare independence, Torygg might have done it."
Because the Dominion is a sleeping beast that Skyrim cannot slay alone. Because many Nords are part of the Imperial army even now.
Because the food and resources we get from the Empire are important to our people.
"Because even if we can't openly worship him, Talos the god was once Tiber Septim the man, and this is his Empire."
And Torygg wasn't ready to let it fall apart.
"By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept."
"Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King."
"Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day."
"When Ulfric's lips parted, when he unleashed the power of the Thu'um... That Shout, that ancient and terrible tongue... ripped Torygg asunder."
"Not much, to be honest. Their return was a shock to us all. Giraud Gemane has some tomes about them in the library, if you're interested."
"That I do. I had a messenger from Dragon Bridge stop here on his way to the Blue Palace, not too long ago."
"He was very nervous, mentioned something about needing help."
"At times. Jaree-Ra stopped by the other day. Told me to keep an eye out for him, see if any new people arrived in the city."
"Everyone who's anyone. Viarmo bought an apple the other day, said he was looking for a new student."
Not lately. Business has been slow.
"Oh, yes. A secret family recipe. The only good thing my father Octieve ever did. In fact, it's so good, no one else in Skyrim even tries to make any."
"It's a great big festival put on by the bards, every year. They burn an effigy of old King Olaf. It's quite a bit of fun."
"The bards give out spiced wine during the festival, so they put in a big order. And then, for weeks after, demand is so high, I can barely keep up."
"But with the death of High King Torygg, the Festival has been declared [QUOTE]in poor taste.[QUOTE] So it looks like it won't happen this year."
"Svari, yes. It's been hard on her. The girl misses her uncle."
I've tried to explain that Roggvir did something bad and that we all have to be accountable for our actions but... a child feels what she will.
And? Were they magnificent?
Oh. J'zargo takes this to mean it did not go... well.
"This was not the intention, to be sure. It is true that J'zargo was slightly concerned there may have been... problems."
But you were not placed in harm's way on purpose.
"Still, you are a good friend to J'zargo now, for taking this risk. J'zargo thanks you."
"I still need some help, if you can spare the time."
"If you have a moment, could you help me with something?"
This will only take me a moment...
"We're all trying to become better mages, right?"
"Well, I need someone I can practice a few spells on. Nothing dangerous, really. Would you be willing to assist me?"
I still need someone to practice a few spells on. Interested?
"Well, I... I simply thought you might wish to help out one of your fellow mages."
"If that's not enough, I suppose... I have this amulet you could take."
"No, not that kind of spell. Believe me when I say I wouldn't be asking if it weren't necessary."
"Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to go ask J'zargo."
"Now, you just stand there..."
"Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to rely on Onmund."
"Now, you just stand there..."
Thank you. I was afraid I'd have to figure out some way to do this on my own.
"Now, you just stand there..."
"Oh. Well, if you change your mind, let me know."
"Please hold still, and don't move."
"There! Now, I..."
Oh dear. That wasn't supposed to happen.
"Do you... do you feel all right? You look very, umm, green."
You have to hold still or this isn't going to work.
"Okay, now don't move at all."
Oh my. That isn't right!
Just wait. Just... I can fix this.
There! All better.
"Oh no, that's not it at all."
Let me try again...
This really isn't turning out the way I'd hoped.
"I'll get it right this time, I swear."
"Ah. No, that was not supposed to happen."
"But... J'zargo is pleased to see that you are here, and not in pieces!"
You are a good friend to have done this. J'zargo will not forget it.
No?
"It is true, J'zargo suspected there might be problems. But this is most disappointing."
"It is good that you were willing to help J'zargo. This will not be forgotten, friend."
"I am so very sorry. I went over this again and again, and I was sure it would have better results."
It's not!
It shouldn't be. You'll be back to normal in no time.
"And when you are, we can try this again and I'll be sure to get it right."
I'm not really sure. I think it's just a minor miscalculation on my part.
"I'm sure it will wear off soon. When it does, you'll be perfectly fine, and then we can try again."
"In the meantime, I'll see about figuring out what went wrong."
Let me see.
Fine. We do it your way. For now.
"Do what he says, Vex. This isn't helpin' right now."
Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot?
"He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer."
"A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of mine in Winterhold."
Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
The wizards called it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous amount of gold to have it made.
"If you can locate the quill and return it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider the debt satisfied."
The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing in exacting detail.
"I'm sure you can understand how useful that would prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were involved."
"Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known only to myself."
"So if you're getting any ideas about selling it to someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value."
I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the lake so he could avoid the roads.
"The idiot got lost in the mist and ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom."
"He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to find it in the past has been unsuccessful."
Really? I wrote that off a long time ago.
"Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain."
"Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again."
But I can't leave here! I'm supposed to watch his house. What do I do?
"Oh come on, I ain't that dumb."
"Wow, sure is nice of ya'. Here, hang on to the key and don't let anyone in!"
Hang on Mercer! I'm coming to help!
See ya' round.
This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.
"While you're in there, help yourself to anything in Frey's manor. I would."
"Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that madman."
"I'll watch for Mercer, just get the information we need."
"Come on, we need to show the journal to the Guild."
"If you find Mercer, give no quarter... kill him and be done with it."
Ha ha! That's funny. Ya' think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight.
"I don't know how ya' talked Maven into letting me go, and I don't care."
"You did something for me, I'm gonna do something for ya'. Here, take the key to Mercer's house. Won't need it any more."
Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks... I'd check under the water near one of the small islands in the lake.
Perhaps you should start at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.
An old woman can get away with almost anything.
Watch this.
J'zargo sees what you are up to. Very well.
J'zargo awaits word of how well his scrolls work.
"I hate it here. Those were my favorite shoes, ruined and for what? We never even made it to the wedding."
"Wha... Your shoes? We get robbed by bandits, my clothes torn to shreds by some giant cat, our bodyguard eaten by a dragon..."
And you're worried about your shoes?
"When we get back to Cyrodiil, I swear I will hire an army of battlemages to come up here and set fire to the whole damned province."
Just get away from me. We've got nothing left to steal.
I bet the wedding was amazing... and we missed the whole thing.
Leave me alone. I just want to find my way out of this accursed province.
Ugh. It's talking to me.
I hate this place. I hate the trees. I hate the rocks. And I hate the snow.
Clearly you have no idea who I am you or you wouldn't dare approach me.
"All right... All right... Fine. I thought we were friends, but you're a real jerk, you know that?"
Are you kidding me? I fought off all those bandits. I'm not afraid of you.
"Yes, that's right.  Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine."
"Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion."
"Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper."
"Aye, that I did. I commanded a force of several dozen men, most of them levies from villages in this part of the hold."
I damn near met my end in that war. An Aldmeri soldier ran me through with his blade and left me for dead.
"A healer named Jouane saved my life. He's been my closest friend ever since. I tell you, that man is a miracle worker."
"Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could."
"With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts."
"And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men."
"The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid."
"Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now."
"Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see."
"We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend."
Secret? What makes you think there's a secret?
"There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods."
"How can we? We're a community of farmers, not fighting men."
"If not for the war, we might have enough guards in the hold to protect the settlements. That the dragons should return now is most unfortunate."
Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this?
"I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here."
"Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere."
"In Whiterun, mostly. Ennis handles the business arrangements, but I know that he has a few purchasers who give us a fair price."
"Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people."
I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.
"What would you have me do? If we do not send men to fight in the war, you'll find yourself guarding one of Ulfric's men."
"And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos."
"Nonsense. If Balgruuf falls, someone will take his place, for better or worse. In the meantime, we have a war to win. And win we must."
"Balgruuf, did you slip out again last night for a drink at the Bannered Mare?"
"Heard about that, did you? Yes, I went out for a pint or two. What of it?"
These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.
"Damn it, woman, I'm the Jarl of Whiterun! I won't apologize for talking to my people. You can't protect me every moment of the day."
"That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying."
"My lord, our provisions are running dangerously low. Our stores of meat, wine and grain are all but depleted."
"Purchase more supplies, then. That's your job as Steward, isn't it? Why do you trouble me with these details?"
"My lord, since Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising, the cost of goods has doubled. I'll need more coin if I'm to provision us properly."
"Our coffers are nearly empty. I can scarcely afford to pay the guards, and we need every one of them in these troubled times."
"You'll have to make do with what we have, Proventus."
"Yes, my lord."
I didn't know it when we were... with each other... but Alain is actually the leader of a band of cutthroats. Bandits.
They're holed up in some old dwarven ruin - Raldbthar. It's near Windhelm. They use it as their base. It's where they stage their raids.
"I want you to go to that ruin, find Alain Dufont, and kill him. I don't care about his friends. Do whatever you want with them. But Alain has to die!"
"Muiri? Muiri? So, what, you're the cow's champion? Oh, now that is rich. Well then, champion, let's get this over with."
"A joke? Alain Dufont... a joke? I am a king on my throne, and you, my friend... you will die slowly, and painfully."
"Ha! My opponent is so paralyzed with terror, no words will come. Let's be done with it, then!"
"I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages."
"One of my monks, the elf Orchendor, was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bthardamz for me, but has since lost his way."
"I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name."
You cannot eat Gleda! Gleda is protected by Grok!
"Hey, who's there?"
"Unless you've come to pay a ransom, turn around and walk away."
"Ah, there you are."
I hope you've readied yourself.
I'm just saying that these ceramic lamps make me nervous. They just seem so... fragile.
Just shut up and play the game.
"My dear vagrant, we're the only family worth knowing in Markarth. We own everything in this city, even the jail."
"And guess who owns the Silver-Blood Inn? Not that we named it that, the people just insisted."
"I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that?"
High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world.
I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before.
No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.
"Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend."
"Yes, my lord."
"Yes. They chose me when I was just a lad. It was a great honor, of course. I was to become a Greybeard myself."
"I spent almost ten years at High Hrothgar, learning the Way of the Voice. Then the Great War came... I couldn't stand missing it."
"I often think about High Hrothgar. It's very... disconnected from the troubles down here. But that's why I couldn't stay, and why I couldn't go back."
"I suppose the Greybeards care about Skyrim's troubles, in their way, but I needed to do something about it."
I'm sure Arngeir would call it one of my failings.
"Yes. The oldest and most powerful, although he may not seem so."
"I doubt he's forgiven me for leaving. And for... well, for what he'd consider blasphemy. Using Shouts for anything but worship of Kynareth."
Yes. Although I rarely use my training. The Greybeards believe the Voice should be used only for worship of Kynareth.
"I have... fallen from their strict teaching, but I still don't feel it should be used lightly. Not all of Arngeir's lecturing was wasted, it seems."
"You're Dragonborn. The rules don't apply to you. You can Shout the way dragons do... without training, through inborn instinct."
They always hope to teach the Dragonborn to respect the Way of the Voice as they do. They never fully succeed.
"You'll have to make your own decision. It's a beautiful philosophy, but outside the seclusion of High Hrothgar, I was never able to hold to it."
I studied with them when I was young. They taught me how to Shout.
"I don't believe it. I made that bow myself. Been through some messes with it, let me tell you."
"You know what? I want you to keep it. My great hunts are behind me, but yours are yet to come."
"Grandson. He's a strong lad. His parents were at Helgen when, well you know."
Can't say I was a great father the first time around. Now that he's here it's like a second chance. He's a good lad.
"Froki won't let me hunt on my own yet, but he never shuts up about killing his first stag when he was eleven."
"It ain't so bad. I miss living with my parents back in Helgen, though. Froki can't cook and there's nobody to talk to up here."
"Yeah, but don't say anything about it to Froki. I don't think he understands."
"It's okay, I know what happened at home. With the dragon and all."
I'm looking for a place called Bard's Leap. They say the echo of a song sung from there can be heard all the way in Solitude.
"Some may find their inspiration tucked away in tomes, or by carousing in the cities, but I find it here in the vast expanses of Skyrim."
The best tales are those of adventure. Who could truly write such a tale without first experiencing such?
"Why to perform for my common man, of course! Why should only the courts and inns of wealthy towns be given the gift of music?"
"Observing and capturing the epic struggle for Skyrim! When brothers clash with bitter blades, surely there is a song to be found."


"Food, experience and a roof over my head in the finest city in Skyrim."
"If money's all you hold dear, then you you end up like Jaree-Ra. A plague on the city."
"Captain Aldis can't prove it, but that Argonian is up to no good."
"Really? I knew he was mixed up in something dangerous, but I hadn't heard he was dead."
Why of course. And will you also be needing the bow that shoots rainbows? Or perhaps a quiver that dispenses beer?
"Look, if you want arrows we have them, but don't insult my intelligence."
Look for yourself.
Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever magic he's using to shield himself.
I hope your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it.
Let's see where this goes.
Damn it. No going back that way.
I guess we're lucky that didn't come down on top of us.
We'd better push on. I'm sure the others will find another way out.
Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her?
"I'd rather not tangle with her right now. We might be able to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step."
Easy does it now.
Whew. That was close.
"Not the sneaking type, huh?"
The Word calls you. Go to it.
"Why do you intrude here, if not for tinvaak?"
I have spoken. The Rotmulaag waits.
She... She didn't make it.
"When it was clear we were going to have to fall back, she stayed behind and made sure the rest of us were all right."
What are we waiting for?
Not until we're all ready. We have to go together.
I'm as ready as I'm going to be.
How much worse is this going to get?
We need to get in there and stop this!
Make yourself useful and chop up some firewood. There's a few coins in it for you.
"If it's work you need, how about chopping up some wood for the fires?"
Here for work? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop.
Honest gold for honest work.
I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.
These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.
I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party.
That was delicious.
"This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake."
"I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace."
The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.
"With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late."
"It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long."
"Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?"
You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?
I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?
"I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?"
I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?
I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?
"Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm."
"They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches."
"Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter."
"Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful."
Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?
"Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day."
"Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon."
"Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs."
"Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that."
"Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly."
Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.
"I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane."
"It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me."
"After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?"
"Well, I did see something interesting not long ago."
There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares.
"You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on."
I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim.
"They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating."
"They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat."
"Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true."
I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment.
Do enjoy yourself.
I need another drink.
"Goodbye, then."
Farewell.
Don't let me keep you.
"Until later, then."
May wisdom light your path.
Good speaking with you.
Until next time.
Keep an eye on these Thalmor. You never know...
Come and visit me in Solitude sometime.
Very well then.
"It was a pleasure, thank you."
We are traveling to the Shrine of Kynareth in Whiterun. I hear the Gildergreen is more beautiful than ever since it's been restored.
They say that eating the fruit it bears will add years to your life.
Are you finished ogling the grotesque? I suppose I should be grateful you didn't simply attack me.
I am one of the Afflicted. I'd have been dead from this plague a year ago if not for Peryite's protection.
"Returning to High Rock. Our shepherd lost his way, and I fear Peryite's wrath may consume those who remain with him."
Kesh could tell you more. I just want out of Skyrim as quickly as possible.
And I have no more time for talking. Go speak with Kesh if you are so curious.
"Hey, you. You're finally awake."
"Time to finally see the sky, and make it rain red."
And you've proven that was the best move I could have made. Don't give me that look. You're free to go.
"Here, how about a little token for your efforts? My family's ring and all the things the guards confiscated from you when you were jailed."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to figure out how we're going to fill our recently emptied mine."
Why settle for just stabbing your foes when you can roast them alive in a gout of arcane fire?
"Watch your back, friend. Better yet, pay me to do it for you."
Best not to walk the roads of Skyrim alone.
"Walk always in shadows, so that you will see your foes before they see you."
"The blade can be as lethal as the spell, but deadlier still is the one who wields both!"
There's nothing more I can teach you.
You've already learned all I can teach you.
You already know all that I know.
"As steward, I serve as an intermediary between the Jarl and her subjects."
I also handle the less important and day-to-day policies that effect daily life in Riften.
Lately I've had my hands full suppressing these ridiculous accusations of corruption in the keep.
"I'm not certain what business it is of yours, but I'm moth... I mean Jarl Maven's steward."
"I run the prisons in Riften, keep the riff-raff from robbing the good folk of this city and have drunks tossed into the lake."
Defense? No one would dare attack Riften. I'm not sure you realize just how well connected Jarl Maven is with the Empire.
"With a single snap of her fingers, we could have a legion here in a fortnight."
Indeed. You don't get to the position my mother's achieved by blind luck... her business sense and diplomatic skills are legendary.
If you say so.
I don't care what you think. The Empire put Maven on the throne for a reason. That's all you need to know.
Ulfric's a bloody hero. I don't think there's a worthy Nord alive who'd dare argue the point.
He's taking the Empire to task and making them answer for their crimes.
I don't think I'll be content until Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim with the ashes of the Concordat at his feet.
"Hey, if the Empire and the Stormcloaks want to kill each other over some foolish cause, I say let 'em."
All I care about is two things: watchin' Maven's back and countin' the gold she pays me to do it.
"You there, please you have to help me! I was attacked by a vampire! Do you have a potion or something that can cure this before I turn?"
"Here I'll show you on your map so you can stay away. Please, if you can help me let me know or get out of my way so I can try to find a priest."
"Oh, thank the gods. Here, take this with my thanks."
Then get out of my way. I have to get to a town and find a priest.
I'm on my way to Solitude to join the Legion. A united Empire is better for everyone.
"I was born and raised in Skyrim, but the Nords treat us like dirt."
I want to be on the right side.
I'm on my way to Windhelm to join up with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric has the right of it.
The Empire is in shambles. They've banned the worship of Talos.
"I may have roots in Cyrodiil, but Skyrim's as much my home as any Nord's."
I've got a message for you from Louis Letrush. This is for double crossing him.
Excellent. You've done us a great service. Here is your reward.
Here. Take a look at this. Some of the Jarl's men came by and left this bounty letter.
"If you change your mind, seek me out here."
My patron appears once more. Have you need of my blade?
"It pleases me to see you again, my patron."
Didn't think I'd be seeing you again so soon.
You're looking hale and healthy. It's good to see you again.
You're back! Great! Are we going on another adventure?
It's great to see you again! It's been too quiet without you around.
"Well, look what the horker dragged in. Still wandering all over Skyrim and causing trouble?"
"I knew you couldn't stay away. Admit it, you were lost without me."
"Well, look who it is. Been keeping out of trouble much? I hope not!"
"If you need some skulls crushed, I'm still available for hire."
"It's good to see you. If you need my help again, it's the same fee as always."
"Well met, friend. It's good to see you're still in one piece, with all the trouble you get into."
"I'm what you'd call of soldier of fortune. Make me an offer, and I just might fight at your side."
"Can't be too careful these days, with the war and other dangers. For a fair price, I'll watch your back."
"If you've got the gold to pay my fee, then my sword-arm is yours."
"Some call me a mercenary, but I like to think of myself as a freelance adventurer for hire."
"My skill in battle is unmatched. Fortunately for you, that skill can be bought."
Why hire a common soldier to protect you when you can have a master of the arcane?
"The only thing better than a powerful mage fighting at your side is... well, nothing, really."
"If it's a mercenary you're looking for, you've found him. There's no stronger sword-arm for hire in all Skyrim."
"For a modest fee, I'll bring my formidable arcane powers to bear against your foes. What do you say?"
"If you're looking to hire the strongest mercenary in Skyrim, I'd wager your search is over."
"Sell-swords are common in Skyrim, but you'll find precious few as stout and as a strong as I am."
"Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you."
"I've fought in more battles than I've got years of life in me. Pay my fee and I'll put that experience to work for you, friend."
"I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe."
"Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger."
"By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee."
"I am a lethal instrument, yours to command for a modest sum. I suggest you hire me before one of your enemies does."
"I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?"
"Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?"
"Good to see you again! How would you like to hire a brave, if untested, mercenary?"
"Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll be well -prepared to face threats both magical and mundane."
"It just feels right somehow, having this new life as an adventurer. It's what I was meant to do."
"At first I thought I'd miss farming. I guess I've had my fill of it, because I don't miss it at all."
This new armor fits me like a glove.
"If I can make enough money here in Skyrim, I think I'll travel to Hammerfell and see what work I can get there."
"Oh, I am well. I will be well. Well to be within the will inside the walls."
"You must bring it to Avanchnzel, in the west. Return it to them. It must go back."
I won't be the one to go back there. I won't return to Avanchnzel. You can't make me do it.
Don't forget me next time you need herbs and potions.
Thanks again for finding out about my daughter.
Come by the Winking Skeever any time you want to hear a tune.
You should think about staying the night. Corpulus keeps a clean inn.
Stick around! Still plenty of songs to sing and mead to drink.
Come back if you want to play tag.
"Papa doesn't like when I talk to customers, anyway."
Remember the Winking Skeever next time you're footsore.
"Need anything, you just say the word."
I was done talking anyway.
Yeah. Next time.
May song speed you along.
May the words of poets keep you warm.
May all your adventures be worthy of telling.
Now you can say you've met the most talented bard in all of Skyrim.
"Don't forget my name. Someday, everyone will be saying it."
Glad that distraction's over...
We're done then? Good.
I suppose I should return to my papers...
Always good to talk to a fellow bard.
"Farewell, stranger."
"Stop by again, sometime. I'll sing for you."
"Anytime, friend."
Always time for a fellow bard.
"Oh, if you haven't heard Dean Pantea sing, you should."
We should talk again sometime.
Always glad to talk to a bard.
Thanks for taking the time. People never want to talk to me.
"Okay, I'll go now."
I'm glad I could help.
Anything I can do.
Always glad to talk to the bard who returned part of the Poetic Edda.
It's been an honor.
"I'll get back to court business, then."
Keep your sword arm strong.
Always have your shield at the ready.
"Take care of your armor, and it'll take care of you."
I must return to the court. They simply can't make do without me.
"Good, we've wasted enough time here."
We'll speak again later. If we must...
I'll be sure to check [QUOTE]Talk to random stranger[QUOTE] off my list of today's tasks...
You are free to leave.
You are excused.
I am done with you. You may go.
Be well. Pray for Solitude and my husband.
Keep the faith. General Tullius will win this war.
We have the utmost confidence in you and Ulfric's guiding hands.
May the blessings of the Eight be with you.
May the blessings of the Nine be with you.
Feel free to return to me with questions. The Blue Palace is an open forum.
Please feel welcome in the court of Solitude.
I won't forget what you've done for Solitude.
Anyone with a stout heart like yours is welcome here.
I'm proud to call a man like you friend.
I'm proud to call a woman like you friend.
"Do not dishonor or attempt to harm Elisif in any way. Adhere to that rule, and you'll be fine."
I must return my attention to Elisif. If were were to lose another Jarl while I was... distracted...
"Take care of yourself, and always remember: the world is ripe with people looking to spill your blood..."
Stay guarded. You never know what could be out there.
"All right. Back to slicing, dicing and baking."
Back to my errands.
Don't mess anything up while you're here...
Good talking to you. Not many care to chat with the help.
"Okay. I need to get back to the palace soon, anyway."
"You can catch me at the Blue Palace later, if you want to talk again."
"If Erdi caught me chatting, I'd never hear the end of it..."
"I guess I should be getting back to work. It was more fun talking, though."
May Arkay bless you with a long life.
May the light of truth keep the darkness at bay.
It's best you leave me be.
"Sure, you make your retreat and I'll make mine."
Keep your head about you.
Just watch yourself. You don't want to meet me on the job.
Tell these Horkers to set me free.
Leave me be. I'm no harm here.
Keep my men in your prayers. They'll need them if they don't shape up.
"Stay strong. The Eight willing, we'll win this war."
"Sure, whatever you say. Bye."
"You should speak to my daughter, Evette. She's the brains of the family."
Always good talking to you... friend.
Thanks for talking to me.
"For a stranger, you're not so bad."
"Blessed are those who worship, for they know true grace."
Keep the faith.
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Eight.
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Nine.
Your rewards in life will match the strength of your faith.
The Temple of Divines is always open for worshipers.
"Take care, and go with the blessings of the Eight."
"Take care, and go with the blessings of the Nine."
I really need to get back to planning my wedding..
"Now if you'll excuse me. The East Empire Company has several accounts, and it's up to me to balance them."
Perhaps I'll be seeing more of you.
Please come back if you're ever in need of fletching supplies.
Good to talk to a fellow traveler.
Stop back anytime.
"Thank you for helping my Aunt, earlier. I'll see you around."
"People to see and places to go, huh? Later, then."
"I understand, you're an important person. I'll catch up with you later."
I should make sure Svari is okay.
Addvar won't sell anything if I don't go and check up on him.
Come back to Bits and Pieces anytime.
Make sure to recommend us to your associates.
Return anytime you need arms or armor. My forge never rests.
Keep safe. And always wear your armor.
Finally...
Thank the gods for the end of yet another pointless conversation...
Thank you for your patronage.
I do hope you'll remain in Solitude. This city could do with some new blood.
Remember Radiant Raiment when you need a change of attire.
May you sword feast on Stormcloak flesh.
Good hunting. Go kill some bandits for me.
"If you're off to fight, talk to Beirand before you go. His armor is well forged and dependable."
These are troubled times. Be on your guard out there.
May the gods speed your journeys... and steady your sword arm.
Come back when you figure out how to spend money.
I'll always have fruit to buy. Until it goes rotten. Then... I won't.
Good luck out there. It seems like a tough time to be wandering Skyrim.
Stay warm and keep sober. It's the two things I know for sure will make life better.
If you're heading up to Solitude you should stop to check out the view on your way. It's a good one.
Carriages to all the cities in Skyrim. Don't forget us.
A man like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
A woman like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
Plenty of chores to do...
Pa always says good men need few words.
"I want to check on Grani, one of our horses. Goodbye, stranger."
You really don't know?
"He let Ulfric Stormcloak escape Solitude. Ulfric rides in, murders the High King and Roggvir lets him ride right back out."
You really don't know?
"He opened the gate for Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric rides in, defeats the High King and Roggvir was the one that let him ride right back out."
And now the Stormcloaks have claimed the entire city. I guess we have Roggvir to thank for that as well.
Not my finest hour. Roggvir was a fine and honorable man.
No. I think he was entirely wrong. Roggvir's execution was justified and necessary.
"Being honorable might make you a good man, but it doesn't make you right. Be a better world if it did."
Sometimes you just do what needs to be done. You don't have to hate a man to kill him.
"Though, admittedly... it helps."
"This city has a long history of madness and murder. The Wolf Queen... Pelagius... The death of High King Torygg... And now, public executions."
"My books tell the stories. Have no doubt - as pretty as its streets are, as jovial as the bards may be... darkness is drawn to Solitude."
"You mean Roggvir. Yes. I made an appeal to Captain Aldis. He allowed Roggvir to have a proper Nord burial, as is the custom in Solitude."
"Depends on what you mean by [QUOTE]busy.[QUOTE] I'm also the head jailor in the dungeon here. Quiet job, usually."
Ain't got one. But I'd fancy a chance at that Jaree-Ra's scrawny neck.
"Filthy Argonian never would have set foot in this city, if High King Torygg was still alive. I can tell you that."
Can any man hope to be ready for a dragon?
I can but hone their skills and harden their hearts. The rest is up to the gods.
You're the Dragonborn aren't you?
I'm sort of hoping you're going to fight the dragons for us. A normal man is no match for a dragon.
Dragon?
Really? Was it big? Did it breath fire?
"Oh, wow. I knew it. I knew they were real! I have to remember to tell papa."
"Then like Roggvir, you're a Nord at heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand."
I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...
I... I think I need to stop talking now...
Roggvir. He opened a gate and they executed him for it.
He opened a gate and the wrong man rode out of it. If that man hadn't been Ulfric Stormcloak. If Ulfric hadn't killed High King Torygg...
"But it was Ulfric. And he did kill the High King, in honorable combat. My brother refused to allow the the Imperials to take revenge for the deed."
So now he's dead.
"Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!"
"He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything."
My brother was the best man in Solitude.
"Then like Roggvir, you have a Nord's heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand."
I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...
I... I think I need to be done talking for the moment.
Where the Dragon attacked?
We've heard rumors of death and... and fire from the skies. But no real news.
Then we should soon be selling arrows by the bushel. A sword is no good against a dragon.
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man steers clear of Stentor.
And keeps himself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart woman steers clear of Stentor.
And keeps herself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
"Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities."
Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.
Let's just say the headsman's axe may not be the worst way for a Solitude Jail prisoner to die.
Look at that. I've told you to watch your tongue and mine is waggling. I've said enough.
If you're looking for a good attitude go see the Bards. They'll fake it for you if nothing else.
"Listen, Roggvir and I grew up together. It was us, a few others and Vivienne. Vivienne Onis."
"I have no idea why, but one day, I told Roggvir I liked her. It was a stupid thing to do... He mocked me incessantly after that."
"From that point forward, every time Vivienne and I were anywhere close to each other, he made sure to humiliate me."
"He'd beat me up, dump mead on my head, anything he could get away with. Once he even slipped a beehive into my bed."
"We were children, sure. But Roggvir never outgrew that immaturity, or his cruelty. So any talk about him being an [QUOTE]honorable[QUOTE] Nord? Pure folly."
Work in it? I own it.
You could say that. I own the place.
"The Jarl has put out a bounty on Forsworn. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
"The Jarl has put out a bounty to slay a giant. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
"Come on now, watch the footwork. Keep your balance."
Strike when the shoulder turns. He's giving you openings!
Watch the eyes!
"Just keep moving, you'll wear him out!"
Get him!
Chop chop!
Get in there and push!
All right!
Nice!
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Just keep swinging!
Pull him back!
"Great, back to the fight."
Always good to see 'em go.
So who's winning now?
Keep a sharp eye about you and maybe I'll teach you to fight some day.
Watch the blades.
"Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do."
"Vilkas, take her out to the yard and see what she can do."
Aye.
Vilkas will see if you're worth our trouble.
I hear you have spirit. This is good. You may yet join our numbers.
"Keep up the effort, boy. Eyes on the horizon, always."
"Keep up the effort, young one. Eyes on the horizon, always."
"Wait, before you go..."
I've been working on a shield for Aela.
My wife is in mourning and I need to get back to her soon. I'd be much obliged if you could take this to Aela for me.
Are those two at it again?
"Hey, a fight!"
I cannot tell you in detail. I never heard it used. Kogaan. It was the first Thu'um created solely by mortals.
It was said to force a dragon to experience the concept of Mortality. A truly vonmindoraan... incomprehensible idea to the immortal dov.
"Fascinating! So the ancients were more daring... or foolhardy... similar to the Dragon Break itself, although less far-reaching..."
"This Elder Scroll might be able to show you the past in some way, then... yes, yes, it could work."
Paarthurnax? That name is familiar... the legendary leader of the Greybeards?
I would not have expected a scholar of such an esoteric turn of mind among their ranks.
"Hmm. Well, if that's what the Greybeards told you, I confess I don't have a better plan."
"So little is known about the Elder Scrolls, almost anything is possible where they're concerned. Artifacts of truly inconceivable power."
Do you know the College of Winterhold? They have a deep interest in such arcana.
"Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok. Nothing is certain with such things..."
"But I believe the Scroll's bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a... a seeing, a vision of the moment of its creation."
"Then you will feel - know - Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression."
"You will see them... wuth fadonne... my friends - Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir."
The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um - the first Tongues. The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin.
"They were mighty, in their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...  sahrot hunne. The Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater."
"And what's wrong with him, huh?"
"Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King."
Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion.
"But if they've captured you.... Oh gods, where are they taking us?"
"I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits."
Hold it there! Keep your distance.
Is it dead?
Keep firing!
That's it! We'll bring that bastard down!
Is that all you've got?
For Whiterun and Skyrim!
"Come down here and fight, you coward!"
I can't get a bead on him!
Does anyone see him?
We don't stand a chance!
Stay under cover!
Now you're going to pay!
Take him down! It's our best chance!
You... must be Dragonborn!
"I can't talk about it. Rest assured, the Jarl hears everyone's concerns. You will be able to visit the dead again soon."
I don't need to know the details. Blessings of Arkay to you for your help.
Here. Take my amulet as a reward.
"Fine. I can't force you to help me, but the offer is open."
"This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety."
"She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion."
I understand. Speaking to a goddess is overwhelming for many. Return when you're prepared.
Coward. You're nothing. Nothing!
I'm with the Vigil of Stendarr. We believe this house might have been used for Daedra worship. Evil rites and so forth.
"Oh, a customer. Sorry you had to hear that."
You seem to be a little short on coin. Come back and see me when you've got the gold.
"Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?"
"With a master of magic at your side, you'll have nothing to fear."
That's a fair price. My blade is yours.
"My blade is sharp and I thirst for battle. Onward, then!"
"You have chosen wisely. Lead on, and I shall follow."
What dangers and wonders shall we discover in the frozen wastes? I can hardly wait to find out!
Lead the way!
"Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
Like to see him laugh his way out that.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Truly? So maybe my mother isn't crazy after all.
You had best tell the Jarl in Whiterun. He needs to know about this.
"I see no harm in it, if you have the skill."
The grindstone will improve your weapons. Use the table to improve your armor.
"If you've got the raw materials, you can use the forge to make something new."
Lucan's got a little bit of everything at the Riverwood Trader.
"If you need weapons or armor, see Alvor, the blacksmith."
And by [QUOTE]supplies[QUOTE] I suppose you mean weapons and armor.
Alvor can help you out. He's our blacksmith.
Orgnar.
Orgnar!
Are you listening?
"Wait, where did you get this? This piece was thought to be lost forever, please take this with my utmost thanks!"
Hard not to.
The ale is going bad. We need to get a new batch.
Did you hear me?
Yep. Ale's going bad.
I guess you don't have potatoes in your ears after all. Just make sure we get a fresh batch in soon.
This is for Haldyn!
Horkers' revenge!
Yarr!
"Avast, dog!"
"Die, ya cowardly lubber!"
It's true. For as long as I can remember our crops have always done well.
"I'm not sure whether it's the soil, the climate or the favor of the Divines, but we've never had a poor harvest."
Born and raised right here in Rorikstead.
"My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family."
"My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own."
"It's not the most exciting place in the world, but the people here work hard and don't cause trouble for anyone."
"Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms."
A rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my strength and my wealth is my weapon.
"As for honor, well, there are some luxuries even I can't afford."
Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread.
This is only a taste of the benefits that accrue to those that align themselves with Thalmor interests.
"Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing that luxury with those who can appreciate it."
But I also enjoy learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.
"I've spent most of my life as a trader. I've got a stake in several shipping ventures across Tamriel, mostly imports and exports."
"I made a lot of friends in a lot of ports, and the Thalmor approached me with a generous offer."
"I give them access to my business associates, and they keep my coffers full."
"I trust them completely, because I understand them."
"When the Thalmor want something, they tell you straight. In my experience, they have no interest in subtleties and innuendo."
"So if one of them says they're going to do something, I believe them. When you can just take what you want, there's no need to lie."
"A delicate question, to be sure. I'm the Emperor's cousin, and the Empire has little love for the Thalmor."
"On the other hand, the Thalmor have considerable funds and are looking to expand their shipping."
"I haven't signed any deals yet, but I'm sure my cousin will want a cut if I do. What better way to soothe his wounded pride?"
We have a relationship of mutual respect.
I care little about the politics and rivalries between the Thalmor and the Empire.
"But I do respect power, and the Thalmor have that. They leave me alone, and I leave them alone."
"Don't mention the Guild. In fact, it's better if you don't speak to me at all. This is not the place."
Have you learned nothing about me? I have dealings with everyone.
"Now, leave me. I don't want to arouse suspicion by talking to someone that clearly doesn't belong here."
I lead the Justiciars. We are charged with enforcing the ban on Talos worship.
"Nords can be quite stubborn. They're slow to change their ways, and we find more heretics every day."
But mark me well -- I will purge the heresy from this land as surely as the flame burns the flesh from the bone.
"There is peace now, and that peace will continue for as long as it suits our needs."
"But make no mistake, this is not a peace forged out of necessity between rival nations of equal strength."
"It is more like the calm between storms. And the next storm, I think, will be far deadlier than the last."
That's putting it mildly.
The Thalmor invite me here to remind everyone that they can tell the Empire what to do.
"I would refuse, but I don't want to jeopardize the peace between us."
Elenwen is a formidable woman. She lacks for neither cunning nor ambition.
"Now that I think of it, she would have made a fine Imperial general."
Ill luck. I'm a busy man and I don't have time for this sort of frivolity.
"But at the same time, I don't dare refuse an invitation from Elenwen."
Is it that obvious? I should take pains to seem more happy. I wouldn't want to upset our host.
"But the truth of it is, I have a mountain of paperwork back in Windhelm and it's not getting any smaller."
I just hope this party doesn't drag on all night.
"Oh, yes! Quite! So many important people from all across Skyrim."
I'm the Steward of Whiterun. I serve Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach.
"Truth be told, I'd be more comfortable if I were back there. I get nervous in the company of so many worthies."
"Oh, hello there. I didn't expect to see you here."
"Yes, I am indeed. Elenwen always serves the best wine at her parties. The food is excellent as well."
"Though I confess, being surrounded by so many wealthy and important people makes me feel more than a little nervous."
Go ahead and play your little joke.
"When I married Torygg, he promised we'd go to lavish parties just like this. I wish he were here now."
Isn't this something? Elenwen really knows how to host a party!
I could learn a lot from the people in this room.
Have you tried the wine?  It's better than anything in the Blue Palace.
"Very much so, yes."
Elewen's parties are always so elegant. She really has impeccable taste.
My only regret is that she doesn't host them more often.
I beg your pardon?
"You must have me mistaken for someone else. I am Elisif, widow of High King Torygg and Jarl of Solitude."
"Lucky for you, I possess a forgiving nature and I'm not easily insulted."
"Why, thank you. You are most courteous."
"I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. Normally these parties are reserved for  the Jarls and business leaders of Skyrim."
Elenwen must be very fond of you.
I've got this. Do what you need to do.
This gathering is nothing more than a boast. The Thalmor are reminding us that we're at their beck and call.
We've got troubles enough without the Thalmor and their witch-hunts.
"I'd rather be back at Whiterun, but while I'm here I might as well get some real news from the other parts of Skyrim."
"These Thalmor might not like to admit it, but as long as the Empire has Skyrim, the Empire has strength."
"Not well at all, and I'm happy to keep it that way."
That woman and her Thalmor Justiciars have caused nothing but problems for the people of Skyrim.
I am not. I have no more taste for Thalmor wine than I do for Thalmor company.
"What is more, I'm away from the hold at a time when there are dragons and Stormcloaks on the loose."
There's every chance I'll return to find a pile of smoking ash where Whiterun once stood.
"You asked for my help. Not for nothing, I hope?"
These Thalmor know how to treat a guest.
"A ruler is entitled to luxury, don't you think? The Thalmor understand that."
Why would anyone join the Stormcloaks? They have a fraction of the Empire's wealth and power.
"If I had my way, I'd spend all my time at parties like this, and none of it dealing with the common rabble."
I've known her long enough to appreciate her excellent taste in food and wine.
And also long enough to respect her importance to Skyrim. She plays a vital role in rooting out the forbidden worship of Talos.
"As far as I'm concerned, those Talos-worshippers get what they deserve. All they do is cause problems for me and the other Jarls."
"Yes, I know what you mean. Most Nords struggle to accept change."
"Those who fought the Thalmor in the Great War still see an enemy. But that war is over, and a new day has dawned."
"Besides, the Thalmor reward their friends richly. Anyone who doesn't take advantage of that is a stubborn fool."
"Be about your business, while I'm about mine."
"Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you walk among adders."
It is not eyes that reveal another's true nature. It is the heart.
"If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of judgement and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber."
"There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages."
"Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely so pleasing."
"There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages."
"For this reason, I avoid them when I can."
"I'm doing as you asked. This is for some good purpose, yes?"
"A Jarl has many duties. Attending parties isn't the most important one, but neither is it unpleasant."
Take advantage of the fine food and drink. Such things have been scarce since the war began.
"I came here hoping to learn that more Imperial reinforcements were on their way to Skyrim, but so far I've been disappointed."
"I admit, I've never felt entirely at ease in the Thalmor embassy."
"Well enough, I suppose."
"Elenwen puts a great deal of effort into these parties, and it shows."
I just wonder what her real motivations are. That woman is inscrutable.
"For now, perhaps. But I've heard disturbing rumors that they're marshalling their strength."
I suspect the treaty that ended the war was just a tactic to buy time so the Thalmor can rebuild their armies.
I hope I'm wrong. I'm not sure the Empire can afford another war.
Are you enjoying the party?
Is the food and drink to your liking?
Is my staff seeing to your needs?
"As much as can be expected, yes."
I have no complaints.
"I suppose so, yes."
"Everything is splendid, thank you."
"Very much so, and thank you for asking."
"Very much so, and thank you for asking."
Splendid. Call if you have need of me.
It pleases me to hear you say so.
"Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then."
We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?
Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?
Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.
"Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry."
We've had the same troubles.
I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
"With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old."
We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.
"These are troubling times, indeed."
"These are troubling times, indeed."
I just try to keep out of the way when they start roughhousing.
"Don't mind them. Just working out some issues, in the old way."
"Little blood to clear the air. Hope you have the stomach for it, outsider."
What is it?
"Not now, I'm trying to watch this!"
"Pay attention, you could learn something."
"Are you going to let me watch, or not?"
Look at the young ones scrap!
Twelve septims on the girl! Look at that speed.
Out of the way!
Could you move? You're in the way.
Hope they don't get carried away here.
"Good fight going, here."
There are more books to be recovered and secured in the Arcanaeum.
All right. I wrote down the last place I'd heard about. Don't get killed.
"Some other time, then."
"Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you."
"They're not the sort to take visitors, but I never go that high up the path anyway."
"Some folk who make the trip leave them food or other essentials, but not to make conversation."
"I'm walking the 7,000 Steps to honor the Greybeards and reflect on my own life. It's a tradition among the Nords of Skyrim."
"I like to spend time up here. Walk the Steps, meditate on the emblems. Doesn't hurt when I bag some game along the way."
Enjoying the hospitalities of the inn. Suggest you do the same.
Walking the Steps. Meditating on the emblems. I make this trip every few years.
"Just a pilgrim. I'd prefer to leave it at that, if you don't mind."
I was just outside Ivarstead when it happened. It's an exciting moment. Nothing like this has happened in centuries.
I did. Strange days when the monks will do that. I wonder what it means.
Hmm. How to explain in your tongue? The dov have words for such things that joorre do not.
"It is an... artifact from outside time. It does not exist, but it has always existed. Rah wahlaan. They are...hmm... fragments of creation."
"The Kelle... Elder Scrolls, as you name them, they have often been used for prophecy. Yes, your prophecy comes from an Elder Scroll."
But this is only a small part of their power. Zofaas suleyk.
"Not intentionally. Some hoped he would be gone forever, forever lost. Meyye."
I knew better. Tiid bo amativ. Time flows ever onward. One day he would surface.
Which is why I have lived here. For thousands of mortal years I have waited. I knew where he would emerge but not when.
Knowing a Word of Power is to take its meaning into yourself.
"Contemplate the meaning of a Rotmulaag. You will become closer to that Word, as it fills your inner self."
"Will I teach you, Dovahkiin? What Word calls you to deeper understanding? There are three to master: Fus, Feim, and Yol."
"Fine, I'll show you, you big bully."
Well done. I wasn't certain you'd even know what to look for.
Thank Her Benevolence it wasn't burned like the other tomes.
"How dare you defile this temple, orc!"
"Begone, invader!"
"Die, foul orc!"
You'll pay for your blasphemy!
"Awaken, and perish!"
Feel the Benevolence of Mara!
I'll send you to Oblivion!
This is your final hour!
We must end the nightmares!
"How could you, Erandur..."
Vaermina forgive me...
Lady Mara... preserve me...
I've failed you... forgive me...
Too much... can't...
Lady Mara... I await your embrace...
No... not when we're so close...
Can't fail now... must hang on...
For Lady Mara!
For Dawnstar!
"By Her Benevolence, you shall not stop us!"
Take heed! They've awakened!
Time for your final rest!
They mustn't stop us!
We fight till the last!
...w...what happened? Wait! We're still under attack!
...the Miasma... They're still here! Stop them!
...dreaming... Defilers! Kill the defilers!
..wha?... where?... D-destroy this place! Tear it apart!
...s-sleeping? No! Burn the temple! Kill the priests!
"...not dead? Kill them, kill them all!"
So endeth the lesson.
"Back from whence you came, heathen!"
To Oblivion with you.
"Forgive me, my brother."
"Mara forgives you, my child."
"Rest well and sleep deeply, my brother."
"Hey! There you are, you drunken bastard. I did it, so pay up."
"Whoa, not so fast there, friend. You owe me money."
"You and Sam dared me to go into that bandit camp. Well I did and brought back his stupid hat like you said, so give me the 10,000 gold you promised."
We agreed to 750 gold. I want my money.
"Hey, where do you think you're going? Come back here."
"We caroused together with Sam Guevenne, remember? We broke into the Temple of Dibella? How much did you end up drinking?"
Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy a nice bit of swamp in Black Marsh.
Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy something for this headache.
"So you're telling me you and Sam just sent me in there to die, then? I want my money, you bastard."
"If there's one thing I hate more than a mean-spirited drunk, it's one who can't settle their debts."
"See you, friend. And take it easy on the wine."
"Well... all right. Just because we are friends. Give me, say... 750 gold and we can call it even."
"Nice try, but those bandits almost killed me. Now pay up."
Thanks for the help. The Reach has been crawling with Forsworn lately.
It's a wonder people can get anywhere around here. Maybe I'll avoid this entire hold for awhile. That said... I do have a few things to sell.
"Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more comfortable discussing my findings with you."
"Just another minute, please."
"Come on, we can't stop now. We have to keep moving!"
Where's Elvali? She was right behind me.
Dead. Something grabbed her from behind. Gone before I could do anything.
This is insanity. We never should've come here.
"You're right. This is all my fault. Should we turn around, head back?"
I don't think going back is a good idea.
"Going back would be the end of all of us. We keep pushing forward, and we'll make it. We will!"
"Come on, you can make it. Let's go."
We shouldn't have left her there to die!
"What else could we do? Stay there and die with her? She refused to go on, we didn't have a choice!"
"This is it, you know. Through this door. Can you feel it?"
"We're not going to make it, are we?"
"We stay together, no matter what. Agreed?"
I'll be right with you.
Agreed. We all stay together.
"...I'm sorry, friends. I'm so sorry!"
I had no choice! It was the only way to make sure that monster never escaped!
"I promise you, I'll never let this happen again! I'll seal this whole place away..."
"Welcome, child of Malacath. Your kin bid you welcome to our stronghold."
"Halt, outlander. By the Code of Malacath, this stronghold belongs to the Orcs. Your kind are unwelcome."
"This is our stronghold. Here, we are free to live as Malacath intended, away from the prying eyes of the Nords."
"You must have been away from your kind for a long time to forget. Come, speak to the chief and the wise woman and remember."
"This is our stronghold. Here, we are free to live as Malacath intended, away from the prying eyes of the Nords."
"You're not an Orc, or Blood-Kin, so stay out. We only help our own."
"Ha. We admire your fighting spirit, Orc-Kin. You'll fit right in here. Come inside."
"We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here. Remember that."
"Hmm... we've heard whispers of an enchanted pair of gauntlets, hidden and protected by dangerous men, beasts, or worse."
"They are called the Forgemaster's Fingers. Bring them to our chief, and he will decide if you're worthy to be Blood-Kin to the Orcs."
You do not remember the Daedric Lord of the Orcs? The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse?
We live by his code and follow his teachings. Spend some time with the wise woman and you'll remember.
He is the Daedric Lord of the Orcs. The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
We live by his code and follow his teachings. An outlander like you wouldn't understand.
"There are a few great strongholds worthy to talk about. Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur, Narzulbur, and Largashbur."
Outlanders should mind their own business.
Don't come back.
Damn outsiders.
And stay out.
There's the one about Tiber Septim and the dragon Nafaalilargus. I never bothered to learn it.
The Blades killed them all centuries ago. Nobody asks to hear that lay anymore.
"I think I have a few old spell books laying about. If you want more, you'll have to go to the College of Winterhold."
And I've got better things to do than listen to more of your fantasies.
Are they gone?
Please help. I can pay you.
Looks like we've got ourselves another fool.

Gerdur's family first settled here as wood cutters a few generations ago.
She and Hod run the mill. I make a decent living sharpening axes and fixing the sawmill.
"It's my mill. Some folks think it's my town too, but it ain't. The Jarl in Whiterun owns the land and the town. I just pay the taxes."
Can you believe one person came in here and took out this whole camp?
"Stop yammering and keep your eyes peeled. They could be here at any moment. If I were them I'd come straight here, sword swingin'!"
How can Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible. Could he pick his way in?
Dibella's blessing to you.
Be careful not to fall on your way out.
I have silver to bend.
Farewell.
Come back if you need a new ring or necklace.
Stop by my stall in the market sometime.
"Bye now, mister."
"Bye now, miss."
Come back when you need more meat. Bring gold.
Need to get back to chopping.
Stay out of trouble in my city.
Stay clear of the Forsworn. Bloodthirsty savages.
I should get back to work. Money doesn't count itself.
Time to prepare some more records on the silver trade.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Get going, then."
The blood of Markarth is silver.
I have work to do.
"Yes, I was bored talking to you anyway."
Take care.
I have records I need to tend to.
What? Oh. Bye.
"Bye now, dearie."
"Take care, dearie."
Come back whenever you need something.
"If you need anything else, just ask."
I better get back to sorting the dry goods.
Now where did I put that shipment of forks...
I think I'm going to get another drink.
Bye.
Remember. Ale is cheaper than blood in Markarth.
"Guards are free to search your room. Uh, just keep that in mind."
I should remind Kleppr to clean this place up.
"Bye, now."
May the crags fail to trip your feet.
Safe travels to you.
Good fighting to you.
Live a life worth telling about.
I have a prison to run.
Don't cause any trouble.
I have work to do.
Goodbye.
Now you let me know if you need a cure... or anything else.
I have herbs to mix.
I should get back to memorizing recipes.
"Now, is lavender an herb or a poison? Hmm...."
Bring more gold next time.
Tell everyone you see to bring me some septims.
"If you'll excuse me, I have a city to run."
I have letters to read.
Keep your eyes open for Forsworn when you're on the roads.
Let me know if you need something forged.
Back to making weapons.
I should heat up the forge. Why does it have to be so hot?
"Oh, goodbye then."
"What? Oh, goodbye."
"Yes, yes. I have a lot of research to do."
"Back to my studies, then."
Goodbye. Be careful if you head into the ruins.
Arkay protect you.
Do you feel that?
You're right. We're not alone.
Aye.
It will be so.
Shhh.
We won't return empty handed.
There will be a feast in our honor when we return.
It will be a good day. I can feel it in my gut.
The scent of victory is on the wind.
"As the sun ends the night, end the darkness of this soul, return life to the creature you see before you!"
Why? Why do you pursue me?
It is done. I won't go back to Avanchnzel. I won't.
I could have left it behind. I could have put it back where it came from.
"Hey there! Check out what my friend and I found. I'll sell some of it to you, if you want!"
I found them near the old Dwemer bridge in the far west. I'll mark it down for you on your map for a small fee.
Thank you! You'll find the ruins right here.
Don't look at me. I didn't kill her. I was just... making sure the body got buried.
"You will pay for Malyn's death, Azura worshipper!"
Azura's Star is ours. Ours!
"In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society."
"Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly rivaled our own."
The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland.
The Falmer retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the dwarves who ended up betraying them.
This betrayal made them what they are now... horrible blind monstrosities with a burning hatred of any but their own kind.
"Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view."
Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of my acquaintances. They're animals... they show absolutely no pity or remorse.
Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish to see them avenged.
"If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on the subject. Should be on my table."
Don't go to the Blue Palace. The master is on vacation. Don't listen to Dervenin. Don't do it.
The master has gone but Dervenin will find him. Dervenin should not have gone.
Vacation is where the head is. That is what Dervenin told us about our master. He's cozy in his Solitude.
You have it! The blessed Wabbajack! You must use it on me. You must.
"You're the one who returned blessed Sheogorath. I would be honored to be Wabbajacked by you, your grace."
Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack.
"Ah. Well. After a little incident with a roguish lad and the daughter of a prominent Thane... Well, let's just say, best not."
"Afraid not. But if you're serious about sharpening that tongue, you might try the Bard's College in Solitude."
"Ever since I was a boy, I felt this strange sense of destiny surrounding the Mythic Dawn cult, and now I know what it is."
Don't you see? Fate has led you to me and to the pieces. Dagon has to answer our call. We're so close.
I'll meet you at the shrine.
You don't want to be part of history? Fine. I'll be at the shrine if you change your mind.
"Good. You're here. I'll place the pieces on the altar, and Dagon should speak to us."
I'll meet you at the shrine.
Let me put the pieces on the altar. We'll see if Mehrunes Dagon can still be reached.
Try putting your hands on the altar. Maybe Mehrunes Dagon will speak to you.
"Mehrunes Dagon, the Lord of Change, we have brought your Razor to you. We beg you, please bring the blade's full glory to Tamriel again!"
It's not working. Why don't you give it a try? Just put your hands on the altar.
You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!
"Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha."
Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way.
I can take the pieces back to my museum. Seal them in a display case.
"You get a generous amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die."
Fine. I'm not dying without a fight!
Thank you. Here's your gold. I'll make a run for it back to Dawnstar.
The museum is doing well. I haven't told anyone about the... incident with the Razor.
Good to see you in my museum again. I owe you my life.
"I never thought all I would want is peace and quiet, but I think our little adventure scared me straight."
Run for it!
Your own fate will be your own choice. Just as always.
Now be gone.
"M'aiq's father was also called M'aiq. As was M'aiq's father's father. At least, that's what his father said."
M'aiq wishes you well.
"M'aiq knows much, and tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not."
"M'aiq carries two weapons, to be safe. What if one breaks? That would be most unlucky."
"M'aiq is always in search of calipers, yet finds none. Where could they have gone?"
M'aiq hears many stories of war... yet few of them are true.
How does anyone know there was a city of Winterhold? M'aiq did not see it with his eyes. Did you?
Too much magic can be dangerous. M'aiq once had two spells and burned his sweetroll.
"What does this mean, to combine magic? Magic plus magic is still magic."
It does not matter to M'aiq how strong or smart one is. It only matters what one can do.
"Dragons were never gone. They were just invisible and very, very quiet."
Werebears? Where? Bears? Men that are bears?
Much snow in Skyrim. Enough snow. M'aiq does not want any more.
Snow falls. Why worry where it goes? M'aiq thinks the snowflakes are pretty.
"Skyrim was once the land of many butterflies. Now, not so much."
"M'aiq once walked to High Hrothgar. So many steps, he lost count."
"Once M'aiq got in trouble in Riften, and fled to Windhelm. It is good that nobody there cared."
M'aiq can travel fast across the land. Some lazy types take carriages. It is all the same to M'aiq.
M'aiq does not understand what is so impressive about shouting. M'aiq can shout whenever he wants.
M'aiq saw a mudcrab the other day. Horrible creatures.
M'aiq loves the people of Skyrim. Many interesting things they say to each other.
Nords are so serious about beards. So many beards. M'aiq thinks they wish they had glorious manes like Khajiit.
M'aiq does not remember his childhood. Perhaps he never had one.
M'aiq is very practical. He has no need for mysticism.
Nords' armor has lots of fur. This sometimes makes M'aiq nervous.
M'aiq was soul trapped once. Not very pleasant. You should think about that once in a while.
Some say Alduin is Akatosh. Some say M'aiq is a Liar. Don't you believe either of those things.
Something strange happens to Khajiit when they arrive in Skyrim.
M'aiq has heard the people of Skyrim are better looking than the ones in Cyrodiil. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.
Why do soldiers bother with target practice? One learns best by hitting real people.
M'aiq knows why Falmer are blind. It has nothing to do with the Dwemer disappearing. Really.
M'aiq has heard it is dangerous to be your friend.
The people of Skyrim are more open minded about certain things than people in other places.
Some like taking friends on adventures. M'aiq thinks being alone is better. Less arguing about splitting treasure.
Don't try blocking if you have two weapons. You will only get confused.  Much better to hit twice anyway.
"M'aiq knows many things, no?"
M'aiq is tired now. Go bother somebody else.
M'aiq is done talking.
Faida came by today. She says you left the tavern last night without paying for your drinks.
I must have forgotten. I'll take care of it tomorrow.
"See that you do. You're an embarrassment, Horgeir. I don't know why I married you."
I'm thinking of going for a walk up the mountain later. Would you like to come?
"Oh, that sounds nice. Yes, I think I'll join you."
I'll bring a blanket and some wine.
"One of these days, we'll have to find you a good woman like my Olda."
"Yes, I think I'd enjoy a woman like your wife."
"Well then, it's too bad my wife is already taken."
"Yes, it's a great shame. Gods willing, I'll find someone just like her one day."
"Mind you don't forget to sweep up, Julienne. The floor's looking a bit dusty."
I won't forget. I'll do it after I get the dishes cleaned.
You've been working hard lately. You'll make a fine innkeeper someday.
If the Nine are willing!
"Miss Faida, may I ask you a question?"
"Of course, Julienne. What's on your mind?"
What do you do when a customer can't afford to pay for a meal or a drink?
"Since my customers are mostly local, I just knock on their front doors the next day."
Ari gave me this dagger when we first started hunting together. Always said it brought her luck. You should be the one to carry it now.
Thank you again for all the help.
This is fun.
Sometimes I just like to watch them burn.
You look strong.
Leave me to my work. Unless you plan to stay and help?
"Krosis. Sorrowfully, no. It cannot be known to me."
Hmm. Yes. They are very protective of me. Bahlaan fahdonne.
But I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.
Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and Dovahkiin return together.
"But, I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me."
"Listen, wench, we're on to you. We know who you are, so you'd better come with us right now!"
"I don't know who you think I am, and I don't care. Leave me alone!"
I don't have time for this foolishness. Now come along quietly and we won't have to get rough.
"Brother, I think she's telling the truth..."
I'm not going anywhere.  Now back off before I do something drastic.
She doesn't have the scar.
What? Oh... you're right.
We've made a mistake. Now move along before that mouth of yours gets you into trouble.
"Next time you're looking to pester someone, make sure it's the right person!"
Foreigners. What a nuisance!
They thought I was some other Redguard woman! They just wouldn't leave me alone. I hope they get lost in the wilderness.
"Don't bother me, peasant. I've had a long journey and paid too much coin on these gifts to be late to Vittoria's wedding."
Indeed. If we ever get there.
"What? No! Guard, help!"
Ugh. Speak to my husband if you must.
"Get away from me, you Skyrim trash."
"Hello there fellow, traveler. One itinerant minstrel and wandering wastrel, at your service."
"Hello there, friend. How lucky for you to chance upon a bard on the road."
"Ah, smell that fresh air? Truly, this is a good place to play a song."
"The life of adventure and song is the life for us, eh friend?"
Maven sends her regards Letrush.
"No, how did you find me? Just give me more time, I can pay Maven back!"
"You! You must have told Maven about the horse. If you'd just stuck to the plan, I wouldn't be in this mess."
"This has nothing to do with you, so back off."
"Reasons? Since when does a man need a reason to protect his family, to defend his homeland?"
It's the damn outlanders and Empire that need the reasons.
Enough talk. There's much to do.
Not this Empire. The world's better without it. Certainly Skyrim is.
I fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion. I bled and spilt blood for the Empire. And for what?
The Empire to bend its knee before those evil elf bastards? Signing a treaty meant to kill the heart of the Empire itself. To deny Talos?
No. I will have no part of any such Empire. And I will gladly gut anyone who says otherwise.
"I oppose tyranny. I oppose those who tell me how to live, what to think, and what to believe."
I'm a man. Skyrim is man's homeland. That's a fact. A fact I'm proud of. There's no shame in that. Read your history.
"I am a loyal citizen of the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps."
"But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again."
I've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire.
"Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion."
"But Ulfric and his [QUOTE]Stormcloaks[QUOTE] are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory against the Dominion, it's in the Empire."
The rebels are only inflaming the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its ultimate aim.
"If that's all, there's pressing concerns that need dealing with."
I consider this conversation over.
"I'm a soldier, not a politician. And my personal beliefs are not yours to question."
"The Silver Hand. They finally had the nerve to attack Jorrvaskr. We got most of them, but I think a few stragglers made it out."
Don't leave any of them alive.
These two aren't a problem anymore.
Make 'em bleed.
The beasts return!
"Your blood is ours, Companion!"
You belong to Hircine now!
"All right, that's far enough. You know how this works- toll here is 100 gold."
"Don't play dumb with me. Pay up, and you walk right through. Refuse, and you'll never see the other side."
"Hmm... looks like it's all here. Okay, go on through. But stick to the road, and don't make any sudden moves."
"Not my problem. You want through here, you pay. Or else."
In these parts? Good luck. But don't come this way again.
"Not a chance. Get'em, boys!"
Name's Valdr. I hunt out of Falkreath.
"We tracked a bear to this den. Good coin for those pelts. We had the big sow cornered when they showed up. Three of them, out of nowhere."
Spriggans. Niels went down before we even knew to run. Ari died just inside. I never even thought the things were real.
"I may have lost a drop or two of blood. Truth is, I'm not going anywhere like this. Hurts to breathe."
"I'll give them a proper burial, then head back. Come find me if you're ever in Falkreath. You'll always be welcome at my door."
"Much better. Thanks, friend. I wouldn't have lasted much longer without that."
"But now what? I can't just walk away. Not with my friends' bodies in there, being torn apart by those beasts."
You should have acted. They're already here.
The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
Their defeat was merely a delay.
To the time after Oblivion opened.
When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
But no one wanted to believe. Believe they even existed.
"And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire."
"But, there's one they fear."
"In their tongue, he is Dovahkiin."
Dragonborn.
"A gift, Dovahkiin. Yol. Understand Fire as the dov do."
"A gift, Dovahkiin. Toor. Understand Inferno as the dov do."
"A gift, Dovahkiin. Shul. Understand Sun as the dov do."
"Hear my Thu'um! Feel it in your bones. Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!"
"Hey Ton, you shouldn't cheat on Vekel. He's a good guy."
What are you talking about?
"Come on, everyone knows about you and Brynjolf."
"Well, everyone's wrong. Now why don't you just shut up about it."
"I don't know where you find your sources, but that last shipment of skooma was some of the best quality I've seen in years."
I just got lucky is all. Bumped into someone who knew someone else. The rest just writes itself.
If you like I'd be happy to take it over the operation for you. Take the source off your hands.
And lose out just when the going is getting good? No thanks.
The only thing keeping me from having you killed is Brynjolf. He's stepped in and made amends.
At least you remembered to bring me the information I requested. Give me that.
This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.
Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works.
Maven sent word that you discovered something else while you were out there. Something important to the Guild?
"Time to die, hero!"
"Go ahead, try and fight back!"
Die already so I can take your stuff!
Whatcha gonna do? Huh? Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna split your belly like an old woman's purse!
Gonna rip you... open!
Forsworn forever!
For the Reach!
"Bleed for me, mortal!"
Just a taste!
Hssssss!
Behold my power!
The elements are mine to command!
Your shroud awaits!
I offer you eternity!
Join the dead!
"Die now, and live forever!"
Yeeaaaggh!
Ruh!
Heeya!
Raagghh!
Hunh!
Nyagh!
Hrraaggh!
Nyyarrggh!
Yeeeaaagghh!
Yeagh!
Rragh!
Hyunh!
Arrggh!
Nord... dog!
Filthy... barbarian!
You are no true Elf!
Fall to the Thalmor!
Bow to your betters!
"On your knees, worm!"
Pathetic human!
Suffering to all mankind!
Disgusting... beast!
Fear the Thalmor!
Rragh!
Aggh!
"Father, how come Olda's so mean to everyone? She's only ever happy when she's with Lodvar, and she's not even married to him!"
"That's no business of yours, son. Mind you keep your nose out of it."
Fine.
Did you read that letter from Markarth yet?
"Yes, just this morning. It was from Logrolf. He wrote to thank us for the food we sent."
And how is that old warrior doing these days?
"Not well. He's convinced that his house is haunted, so he's sleeping on the street."
Oh dear. I wish there was something we could do to help him.
"As do I. That man saved my life. I hope that someone helps him, as he once helped me."
Haven't you got some chores to do?
"Papa says I'm not old enough yet, so I help out by patrolling the town with Lucky here."
"Your father's too easy on you, boy. I'd have you cutting wood at dawn if you were my son."
"Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure. Something unique, let's say."
"It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested."
"Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing threat."
It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for it to be well guarded. I wonder why...
Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things is to just let them sort themselves out.
Although now it looks like you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.
I warned them it might be dangerous. It's not my fault they didn't listen.
"As long as the Synod don't blame us for this mess, I have more pressing matters to deal with."
"I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe those sorts of things."
I believe I've heard it said that it's the only thing that could adequately contain his power.
The sort of embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.
I knew you'd come eventually.
"It would seem I'm bound to this place. The bitter irony of it all -- my greatest failure, and even in death I can't escape it."
"I never meant for any of what happened here. Tried to seal it up, lock it away forever."
But now it all comes out again...
"There were six of us. Full of ambition, eager to conquer the world."
"It was Atmah's idea to come here, at first. She talked me into it, and I convinced the others."
"We were sure we'd find it all here, hidden away from time. Power, knowledge... All the things we didn't want to wait for."
We thought it would be so simple.
"Girduin died first. It happened so fast, none of us had a chance to react."
"One moment we joked about what we'd find below, the next he'd been ripped in half."
And then we were all fighting just to survive. None of us were prepared. It was amazing the rest of us survived.
"When it was over, Atmah, Hafnar and I stared, pale-faced, at one another, unwilling to admit we'd made a terrible mistake."
We could have turned back. It could have ended there. But we kept going.
"Elvali died here. I don't even remember what killed her. One of the countless faceless horrors. I think she was glad, in that final moment."
"Hafnar was covered in blood, but his stupid Nord pride wouldn't let him admit defeat."
"I... I don't know why I pressed the others on, convinced them to keep going."
"[QUOTE]If we can just make it through, it'll all be worth it[QUOTE], I told them. And the fools believed the words I myself didn't trust."
"There were only three of us left. Takes-In-Light just sat down and gave up, and we left her there to die."
"I've no idea what killed her, but I'm sure something did."
Atmah cried to herself. Hafnar wouldn't look at either of us. And I kept telling them it would be all right.
"I was in charge now. I pushed them on, insisting it would be worse to try and go back."
What happened after was my fault. All mine.
"We all knew this was the end. Without even opening the door, we knew what was behind it would kill us."
"None of our spells were potent enough, none of our wills were strong enough."
"[QUOTE]No matter what, we stay together[QUOTE], Hafnar said. I looked him in the eyes and lied to him."
"I had no choice, don't you see?"
"I had to leave them behind, had to sacrifice them so I could make it out alive."
"If we'd all died there, if we'd loosed the thing on the world, who knows what might have happened?"
"That's how I consoled myself for years, after I'd sealed this place shut and vowed never to let anyone open it."
"Now you've put it all to rest, but it can't undo my mistakes. They can never be undone..."
"Yes, well so do I. That's why I was hoping you could help."
"Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!"
Are we truly sure this is a good idea?
We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.
"You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!"
"Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with."
"Let's just get inside, see what's in there."
I can't believe we're doing this.
Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?
You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.
"Given the history of this place, it's more than likely there's still some amount of power here."
"Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets themselves -- who knows what we could find!"
And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?
Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.
We... we have to go back. We can't leave Girduin...
"We barely made it out alive, and you want to go back in?"
It's too late. There isn't enough of him left to go back in after.
"Gods, what have we done?"
We can't go back. Might as well go forward. We can still do this.
Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.
"What was that thing, anyway?"
Who in their right mind would be stupid enough to pay you to steal from Maven?
"Whoa, lad. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?"
"Whoa, lass. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?"
Guess I should have known. Maven and Sibbi have been at odds ever since she had him tossed into jail.
"Look, if I were you, I'd proceed carefully. Crossin' Maven is one of the first things you learn not to do when you're down here."
"As far as the Guild's concerned this is between Sibbi and Maven, so we're going to officially stay out of it."
"So Sibbi finally got the nerve to bare his teeth, eh?"
"Look, this sounds like a family matter and I don't want the Guild in the middle of it. You do what you want."
Just don't expect us to at your back when Maven has your head on the executioner's block.
I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true.
"I don't need this. My family wasted 8 generations keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far as I care, it can stay locked in my house."
You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
"I don't care, but my ancestors do. You can't have it."
Divines know the mill could use some new blades. All right. It's yours. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
Why don't you take your coin and keep walking?
"Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house, just don't hurt anyone."
You want a fight? You got it.
"Best leave the past buried, I say."
All at once! You're efficient. I like that. Here's your reward.
"You know, I've heard the Gourmet is in Skyrim right now..."
I can't believe I just met the Gourmet!
"I'm on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Azura, the Goddess of Twilight. If you'll excuse me."
In the mountains to the northeast. I'll mark it on your map.
"It is the Champion of Namira! I was just about to eat. Here, you should have the first bite."
"You were helpful before. I have need of your help again, if you're willing."
You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief.
"The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now."
"He is also a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone, and Vighar escaped."
"Destroy Vighar, my long dead vampire ancestor. Have you changed your mind?"
"No. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame."
Good. He will have fled to gather others of his kind.
I expected too much. I'll seek someone else to salvage the family honor.
My family thanks you. Take this as a token of our gratitude.
"She's here? By Sithis, I thought we'd lost her. Let's go!"
"Oh! Well in that case, lead on. I'm right behind you."
"Damn it, there's got to be a way out of here!"
Sleep.
"I don't know, Babette. Looks like he may have suffered a head wound. Best not let him out of our sight..."
"I don't know, Babette. Looks like she may have suffered a head wound. Best not let her out of our sight..."
Don't you walk away from me!
The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to claim Gallus's former position as Guild Master.
Sides quickly formed behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.
I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was gone.
"Fortunately, I persevered and the other groups were either killed or they left Skyrim."
The infighting had taken months to subside which gave her time to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks.
"I spent thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but it was as if she had simply vanished... like I said before, she was the best."
Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.
"My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had a clear shot."
I made a split second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death.
More than you'll ever realize. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.
"Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue. I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless."
The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot and yet I used it on you.
"I promise you, the thought crossed my mind. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot."
Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done. He needs to pay for Gallus's murder.
All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.
My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply for irony's sake.
"Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal from Gallus's remains. I suspect the information we need is written inside."
I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've never seen before.
Enthir... Gallus's friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course...
It's the only outsider Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his Nightingale identity.
"There were three of us. Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were a anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften."
"Perhaps I'll tell you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold with the journal and get the translation."
"Here, take these as well, they may prove useful for your journey."
"You dare to betray us, Illia?"
"Our sisterhood will be better off with you dead, brat."
Let's talk inside.
"Ah, yes. That scabbard. Notice the insignia? An Oblivion Gate. A key symbol of Mehrunes Dagon, the patron Daedra of the Mythic Dawn."
"Never mind that. Madena is a good woman, but I have my own reasons for opening this museum, and I'm not changing my mind."
I have a collection of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire. Their importance to history cannot be forgotten.
"Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for."
"And here you are. Good. Come in, browse the display, and let's talk. I have a job you look perfect for."
It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn. One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim himself.
"We hid from our past for years, became tradesman, people of coin and influence."
But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied.
"I'll see everyone in Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in our hands, for good or ill."
"Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it... less so."
"You see, Pelagius' mother was... well... let us say [QUOTE]unique.[QUOTE] Although, I suppose in the grand scheme of things, she was fairly average for a Septim."
That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right...
"Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very early age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered... by anyone."
"The objective here is simple, you simpleton!  Use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy, while they do the same!"
Oho! I thought you'd never figure it out.
The butler did it! Or is it the advisor? Whoever that man behind the throne was.
"With the threat gone Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've helped him... sort of. And we're that much closer to home."
"Well now, that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time."
"You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you, Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age."
"He would lie in bed, paralyzed with fear, imagining his own nightmares coming to life. Ooohhh... Scary."
All you need to do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his terrors easy to repel... but persistent.
"Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things. Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel..."
"But the deepest, keenest hatred was for himself."
The attacks he makes on himself can be seen here fully. They are always carried out on the weakest part of his fragile self.
"The self-loathing enhances Pelagius' anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must bring the two into balance."
Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself... and continue hating everyone else.
"Don't get too comfortable here, mortal. You may actually earn your way out."
"All right, hand over your valuables, or I'll gut you like a fish."
"Hail, Nightingale! Luck has shined down on me and made me a rich man. Here is your cut, as promised."
"Hail, brother! I saw you walking there and thought you might need this."
"Hail, sister! I saw you walking there and thought you could use this."
"Ha, what a coward. Didn't even put up a proper fight."
"Then I guess that's your last request, fool!"
"Well. I, uh, can see you're not one to be trifled with. Let this be a warning to you!"
"Nice try, but you don't scare me."
"No, I guess not. Well, get out of here before I change my mind."
"Yes, actually. You look like you're lousy with gold."
I'm not going to ask again.
Of course! I've seen you at the Flagon. My mistake.
Good luck out there!
"A Nightingale? Oh, I had no idea. My apologies."
"Come along, no more stops, we need to find our way to Solitude."
Why are we even going to a wedding at this far flung end of the Empire anyway?
"I told you, it's the wedding of Vittoria Vici, an extremely well connected merchant with the East Empire Company. The Emperor's cousin? Remember?"
"Hopefully these gifts will put us in her good graces, secure that import deal, and lead the way to an audience with the Emperor."
"So, mage from Winterhold, despite your intentions I've beaten your little game."
"Even if all you've said here is lies, I know you have something in Winterhold the Synod Council will be very interested in."
"So fine, trudge off to Labyrinthian in search of your Staff. I shall return to Cyrodiil and deliver my full report to the Council."
"This is not over, I assure you."
Am I? Am I?
I think I've discovered more here than I could've hoped to.
Your trickery won't confuse me!
"Well, yes. Probably."
"I mean, yes. Certainly it is, but that doesn't matter now, because I know you're hoarding something even more important at your College."
The Council will be informed of this. They will find out what you're up to.
"Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed."
Ha! Humor is often in short supply here.
But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that.
"You know, I think you're right."
"No, I'm afraid I don't know anything of the sort."
Dragonborn?
It's been so long since we've had any contact with the Greybeards. Do you really have the Voice?
I would be most impressed to see that.
So the stories are true... you are Dragonborn!
"Normally you'd need to show some aptitude with one of the schools of magic, but you..."
I think there is much that we can learn from each other.
I'm afraid your skills haven't improved enough to be considered.
Excellent.
"I think you'll be a superb addition to the College. Welcome, Apprentice."
"I'll lead you across the bridge. Once you're inside you'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine, our Master Wizard. Please, follow me."
We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to the study of the arcane.
"There are others who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and often in secret."
"No, not recently at least."
"We don't mistake that for acceptance, though. Odds are they're simply too afraid to confront us directly."
And most of us are quite satisfied with that.
Tell me as soon as you've given Camilla the letter.
That letter ought to convince Camilla to never speak to Faendal ever again.
"Faendal thinks he can woo Camilla Valerius away from me. She's already mine, I keep telling him."
What are you doing in here?
Stay where you are. The mother will deal with you.
Here she is.
"If that's how you choose to end your life, so be it."
Fjotra!
"Now, come with me, child. We'll prepare you for the goddess's presence."
"Maybe you could help find it, I just know it's in here."
Some old priest buried here long ago.  I've been searching for his tomb for a few years now.
"It's probably meaningless to you, but according to family legend it links our bloodline back to Ysgramor himself."
"Hmm, it's encrypted.  It'll take a while to figure this out."
And here's a little something for helping me out.
"I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen."
Silus comes from one of the oldest families in Dawnstar. They have a complicated history.
"Several of his ancestors belonged to the Mythic Dawn, the cult that almost destroyed Tamriel."
"His family's involvement was only found out well after the crisis had died down, but it still ruined their reputation. They were outcasts."
And now Silus is back and this museum to the Mythic Dawn is his way of trying to rebuild his family's pride. It's misguided.
Not a student of history I see. It's for the best. They're a group that should be forgotten.
"The only thing you need to know is that they almost destroyed the world, and they were stopped. A long time ago."
"I beg you, don't go into Silus's museum."
That museum is a mistake.
"And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open, friend!"
Let's talk inside.
Yes. My collection of artifacts from a group that toppled an Empire.
"Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for."
"Your loss, but if you change your mind, I'll be here."
Maven! So good to see you again. Hoist a flagon and celebrate with me!
"Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure."
When you're standing downwind of me.
"Sorry, what was that?"
Nothing Vulwulf.... cheers.
"Hey, hey. Sorry. I just get jealous when I hear rumors about you."
"Tonilia, can I offer some friendly advice?"
"You can offer, but I may not buy."
Why don't you just formally join up? Quit sittin' here wheelin' and dealin' when you could be out there makin' a heck of a lot more coin.
We could use someone with your skills.
"Thanks for the compliment, Delvin. I may just take you up on that one day."
"Cowards, every one of them. Running at the first sign of trouble..."
"Riches and fortune, within my grasp, and I have to give it all up because they're afraid of a few dead bodies..."
Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!
Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!
Only one more door left.  Hurry up.
I don't have time to talk. Keep moving!
"Clear out the chamber, and I'll give you the key."
Yes!  The path is clear!
Aren't you worried someone will wander in here? The entrance isn't exactly hidden you know.
"This again? I told you we have someone standing guard out there. And, don't forget the rock trap we rigged up."
"So, stop your worrying and get some rest. Your shift is coming up and I don't want you dozing off again like last time."
I knew I heard something. What's this bridge doing down?
I thought we had a guard posted outside.
We did! Keep your eyes peeled. I don't think we're alone. You check the entrance. I'm going to look over here.
Anything?
"No, haven't seen anyone."
"Keep looking. Someone's here, I can feel it."
Don't wait for me. Get to Korvanjund as soon as you're ready. I'll meet you there.
You have your orders. Rendezvous with the rest of the men outside Korvanjund.
"What did you need, soldier?"
Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.
Must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
Draugr. Dammit. I hate those things.
"Be careful, friend. This place doesn't seem too... forgiving."
"Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to set the rings so the door will open."
Stick close. This place gives me the creeps.
All for some old crown? It's a strange war all right.
The Stormcloaks will never stop us.
So far so good.
See if you can unlock that door.
Did you find a key? See if it unlocks that door.
Unlock that door and let's get out of here.
"Talen, do you believe what they're saying? Do you really think the dragons have returned?"
"I don't know what to believe. If it's true, then dark times may be upon us."
What should we do?
We hold each other close and hope that all of this ends well.
"Madesi, have you heard the Imperials might be headed this way? What would we do?"
"They aren't invading, milord... it's simply a response to Ulfric and his Stormcloaks. I assure you everything will be fine."
But I've heard from the Snow-Shods that they intend to burn this place to the ground!
"Tythis, please. The Snow-Shods are good people, but tend to exaggerate. Try and stay calm for your own sake."
Have our scouts come up with any information on these reports of dragons?
"Yes, milady. That unpleasantness at Helgen supposedly involved a dragon. It killed several soldiers before it departed."
I want you to speak to the city guard. Make sure there's a contingency plan in effect in case Riften falls under attack.
"Yes, milady. I've also taken the liberty in preparing a private carriage... just in case."
"Good. If Riften should fall, it's only right that its leader be spared."
"I am Lu'ah Al-Skaven. Who are you to disrupt my work? Begone, or I will add you to my army of the dead!"

Do you think we could persuade one of the dragons to join our side?
I'm fairly sure that the dragons don't care about our matters one way or the other.
But just think of the advantage.
I'm not saying it wouldn't be useful. But there are better uses of our resources right now.
I don't suppose we would ever really trust the thing anyway.
"Captain, have you heard these stories of dragons?"
"Elda, you know better than to believe every idiot traveler that wanders through."
But they're saying that one of them freed Ulfric... that he's in league with them.
Think about how ridiculous that sounds. Come now.
"Calixto, do you know if there's any truth to these rumors of dragons?"
Eh. I try not to trouble myself with stories of the outside world.
"Now if someone brings me a dragon scale, that's a different story."
But how would you know it's real?
"Ah, I can't reveal all my secrets to you. But rest assured, I would know."
And that's exactly what the old man wanted. I'm glad we could give it to him.
He's not a werewolf any more? Even dead? This is a good thing!
"Yes, you brought honor to him, even after his death. A worthy outcome for a worthy warrior."
"I'll be honest, I wouldn't have expected it."
But that may just be because I remember when you were just a whelp who was begging to join.
"The old man trusted you, so I'll trust you."
"Oh, you don't have to worry about any problems from me. I do what I'm told. Congratulations!"
"If you had told me a few months ago that some outsider I had never heard of would lead the Companions, I might have slit your throat."
But I've seen what you can do. And heard of the love that Kodlak had for you. The trust.
"Let's hope you can show that his heart was not deceived. Good luck, my friend."
Eventually. But this... this is the Tomb of Ysgramor. I think I'm just going to... commune for a bit.
This place is worthy of some time. You go on ahead. I'll see you back there.
I go where my brother goes. I think he wants to look around some more.
Not right now. I'm going to look at some of these carvings. I wonder if Ysgramor ever set foot here while he was alive.
"But you don't have to stay, if you don't want to. I'll see you back at Jorrvaskr. Stories to tell the others, eh?"
You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions leader.
I'd wager old Vignar could see half a dozen of my predecessors.
And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in Hircine's realm.
And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.
Damn rebels.
That the best Ulfric has?
That's how the Legion fights.
Victory... for now.
Ever onward.
I'll never get tired of killing these Imperial bastards.
That the best the Legion has? Heh.
See you in Sovngarde.
That's how a true Nord fights.
"Another day, another victory."
"You and your College have ruined years of my work, I've lost colleagues and friends to the Falmer, and you want me to calm down?"
Go wrong? Go wrong?
Everything is wrong! Everything! Whatever you have at that College has completely interfered with our work here.
"You show up here just as our work nears completion, and now I can't get any results from this because of something at your College."
Do you think me a fool? Do you think I'm too stupid to make the connection? You've ruined my work!
How did you do it?
But it must be something you're doing. There's no other explanation...
"Either you're lying to me, or..."
Just look!
"This should be lit up brighter than the night sky, and it's not! Clearly you've interfered somehow. Or..."
"You have something at your College, don't you? Something immensely powerful. Beyond anything I'd anticipated. What is it?"
The Eye of Magnus?
"Well, I suppose if that means what I think it does..."
"Well, that's interesting...."
"Well, now. This I hadn't considered."
"If that's taken into account, these results make more sense."
"So you do have something, then."
"Whether this was intentional or not, it suggests some interesting results."
"Yes, the staff. Interesting..."
"You're looking for something, yes? The... Staff of Magnus."
"Well, even if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be learned here."
I can't explain the details. That would be giving away many secrets the Synod have learned over the years.
"Also, I doubt you'd be able to comprehend the details."
What's important is that all of this work was designed to reveal to us sources of great magical power.
"Purely to help safeguard the Empire, of course."
"And yet, in the end, only two locations have been revealed to us. One is your College."
"The other... Well, that can only be Labyrinthian."
"Clear Skies will blow away the mist, but only for a time."
"The path to Paarthurnax is perilous, not to be embarked upon lightly."
Taking this man to be interrogated.
That is none of your concern.
"He has knowledge of a cult of Talos. He will tell us what we need to know, or he will die. The choice is his."
"By Imperial Law banning Talos, we have the right to do whatever we want."
"Now, get of my way."
"And now you'll walk away, if you know what's good for you."
"And so, you will die a heretic's death."
"If you're smart, you'll walk away."
"Now, go away."
Perhaps there's something you wish to confess?
"This doesn't concern you, [QUOTE]citizen.[QUOTE]"
You're interfering with official Thalmor business.
Move along.
Walk away. Now.
Or perhaps there's something you'd like to confess?
"Incorrect. You can worship whatever gods you like. But Talos is a man, and only a heretic would think otherwise..."
I don't like you... I think you're a heretic.
I am a Thalmor Justiciar on important business that you are interfering with.
"That we are superior to men is an established fact. For example, take this belief in Talos. The [QUOTE]ninth[QUOTE] divine. Heh."
Certainly you don't believe such things?
"We are special envoys of the Aldmeri Dominion, the rightful rulers of Tamriel. If you'd like I can show you why."
We're making sure your Emperor wasn't lying to his elven masters when he agreed the Empire would give up false gods and foolish beliefs.
It's immoral to worship a man. And it's also illegal. A faithful Imperial citizen would know that.

I'm collecting ingredients to bring to the Gourmet. He'll think my tastes so refined when I offer them to him.
You have heard of the Gourmet?
"Then you know that Gourmet keeps his identity a secret. I'm hoping to discover who he is, so I can tell him how he changed my life."
"For all I know, the Gourmet is a woman!"
"You've not heard of the Gourmet? Author of [QUOTE]Uncommon Taste[QUOTE]? He's a wizard with a spatula. Well, not an actual wizard, but his recipes are legendary."
"Oh, my! You? It is an honor! Your food has opened my eyes to the wonders this world can hold."
"I've cooked every dish in your book, and I must say your brilliance is inspiring. My technique surely doesn't even approach yours... but whose would?"
"Allow me to give you this, the fork I used the first time I tasted one of your dishes. Oh, and these ingredients I've been collecting for you."
I've risked life and limb so that you may create another masterpiece. Make sure to think of me when you use them!
"Good riddance.  Let's move on, the scroll must be in the next room."
"I suppose so. But believe me. Only us servants have a key like that, and its a very expensive looking lock. Really, I wouldn't worry about it."
Here. Take a look for yourself. But give it back soon. It's almost time for milady's medicine.
Help! Assassin!
Let me look.  This is a very exciting moment for me.
"That's Vokun, the guardian of the scroll.  It must be just past him."
Been a long time since someone took the leap. Longer still since any survived it.
"I once performed the entirety of the Poetic Edda from atop Bard's Leap before trying my luck... Well, you can see how that turned out."
That gem looks suspicious to me.
"These wall carvings are ancient, we must be getting close."
There it is!  On the table.
"Yes, yes. My staff, take it. Kill something pretty with it."
Stay where I can see you.
You need an escort at all times.
Come back here!
"Damn it, I lost him!  Protect the Jarl!"
"Damn it, I lost her! Protect the Jarl!"
Protect the Jarl!
"I've been instructed to tell all visitors that the Lady Elisif isn't feeling well. She wishes you a good day, and please call again another time."
Yes. Are you enjoying our little walk together? Or perhaps you'd like to come back when the Lady is taking visitors?
I'm afraid you'll have to come back later. I've been given strict instructions that no one be allowed to trouble Lady Elisif.
"Yes, the Steward is taking visitors. However, I must accompany you at all times while on the royal premises."
"I suppose you're free to frolic with the wenches in the servant's quarters, but anywhere else, you must have an escort. Jarl's orders."
If there's someone in the palace who can speak for you and wouldn't mind walking you around. Great. Lead me to him.
Stay close and in plain view. No funny business unless you want a few inches of steel in your belly.
Private quarters are strictly off limits. You have been warned.
She's telling everyone she's sick. But she's really locked herself in her room because she fears an assassin is out to get her.
"She's locked herself in her room not letting anyone in. Well, except for us servants. She's afraid of assassins coming to get her."
"Even still, I make a point of announcing myself when I enter her room now. I spooked her so bad last time she almost threw the chamber pot at me!"
I know. The poor girl's fright has left her bereft of reason. But there's no talking her out of it. I fear she'll be locked in there for days.
"Not so ridiculous, really. I know people don't think much of her. But she is the Jarl after all.  Plenty of folk would kill to be in her shoes."
"I bet she would feel safer. And hopefully you wouldn't have to baby sit her for long. Once she calms down, she might start thinking straight again."
Let's go talk with her. Stay close. Talk of assassins has the guards jumpy. They might attack you if you're not standing near me.
"Well, she needs to eat. I don't think she even knows where the kitchen is. And milady isn't exactly going to remove her own chamber pot, now is she?"
It hardly matters though. The door to the stairs is securely locked. There's no way anyone without the key can get in. So don't you worry about it.
Elisif...
Go. Away. Please!
I've brought a friend. Someone who can help. A bodyguard. To protect you.
I thought you didn't believe I was in danger!
"It doesn't really matter what I believe, now does it? I've brought you someone who can protect you. That's what you want, isn't it?"
(Sounds of unlocking and unbarring a door)
I'm not taking any visitors.
"Please, just go away!"
Leave - me - a - lone!
Go away!
"Well, what are you waiting for?!"
"Come in, come in! Shut the door behind you!"
I'm glad they finally believed me. About the assassin I mean. It's been so hard since my Torygg passed. No one takes me seriously.
"So how's this work exactly? Do you just kind of stand there on the look out? That's what Bolgeir does. Well, he sort of looms more than stands."
"Bolgeir's loyal, but even he doesn't do what I ask. Case in point, this whole assassin thing. Well at least I have you now."
"Look at me ramble... Well, I guess I'll go about my business sulking in here. You can stand over there in the corner watching for assassins."
This is... he should not have gone alone.
"Thank you for telling me. This is a day where our souls must cry, and our hearts will answer."
Go. Grieve in whatever way you know.
Skjor... I always thought of him as invincible.
"Truly, one of our great fires has gone out."
He was the one I looked up to. I need to find my brother.
He has joined the honored dead. This will be a difficult time for us all.
Unfortunate. He was an excellent sparring partner. I'll miss our training sessions.
I... I can only imagine Aela's anger. I'll make sure not to cross her for a while.
He did? That's... I'm surprised.
I wonder who will replace him in the Circle?
"Tragic, of course."
"But, well. Fires go out. Others ignite. Skjor inspired many with his life. Perhaps his death can continue to inspire."
"Oh my. He was always so kind to me. A bit rough around the edges, but a good man."
I... I'll get his things in order.
That's it! You've got one of them lined up!
"Pretty, pretty flesh. Let me out!"
Almost there! We're so close!
You've done it! That's all of them!
"So, what is it? What have you done?"
"Did you know what we were attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our efforts have been for nothing?"
"Well, explain yourself!"
"Heart of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Forsworn..."
"...rise from death, Blood of our Blood."
"...rise from death, Blood of our Blood."
...hear he's decided to let the Hags turn him into a Briarheart.
That's a true Reachman. Hope he heads to Markarth to take out some of those Nords.
"Oh, this is going to be fun. You've got to use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy while - get this - they use their Wabbajack to defeat you!"
"Inside the mind of Pelagius, silly."
Oh. Is it your... first time?
Mercer never told you about her?
"Karliah is the thief responsible for murdering the previous Guild Master, Gallus. Now she's after Mercer."
"Help... ? No, no! Look I didn't even know it was her until after she contacted me."
"Please, you have to believe me!"
I don't know. When I asked her where she was going she just muttered [QUOTE]Where the end began.[QUOTE]
"Here, take the Goldenglow Estate Deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more to him alive."
Vuljotnaak! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Nahagliiv! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Viinturuth! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
"Alduin, thuri!"
"Alok, Vuljotnaak. Tiid boaan."
"Alok, Nahagliiv. Tiid boaan."
"Alok, Viinturuth. Tiid boaan."
Lok...
Vah...
Koor...
"I will grant you my understanding of Clear Skies. This is your final gift from us, Dragonborn. Use it well."
No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it.
"What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again."
Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?
"Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it."
"If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn."
"No, no, of course not. Forgive me, Dragonborn. I have been intemperate with you."
"But heed my warning - the Blades may say they serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have."
No. Not now. Not until you return to the path of wisdom.
"Do not confuse inaction with indifference. Often the wisest course is to wait and watch events unfold, until the time to act is clear."
"The Blades have never followed that path, of course."
Those who are ignorant find the Way of the Voice easy to ridicule.
"This is why so few follow it, and why the world is as it is."
"Arngeir. Rok los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rok fen tinvaak Paarthurnax."
"Arngeir. Rek los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rek fen tinvaak Paarthurnax."
Dragonborn... wait.
"I cannot teach you the Shout, because I do not know it."
"It is called [QUOTE]Dragonrend[QUOTE], but its Words of Power are unknown to us."
We do not regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the Voice.
He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of the Voice.
But not Dragonrend. The knowledge of that Shout was lost in the time before history began.
Perhaps only its creators ever knew it. But I am not the one to speak of it to you.
I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire story.
Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything?
You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business.
I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.
"Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate."
"Good. Can't have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can we?"
"Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need to pay you something for the goods."
Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life.
"As far as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know."
"Now you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?"
Give Mercer my regards when you return to Riften.
"Look, did you want the information or not?"
Do take care handling that case of wine... it's irreplaceable.
"If you're the best the Guild's got, they're in worse shape than I imagined."
I need you to put all your efforts into this job. We can't afford any mistakes.
"Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we are."
"You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible."
But there is always more to learn. I believe you are ready for the next step.
"Knowledge of truly powerful Illusion spells is here at the College, but it is hidden from those who might misuse it."
"I shall teach you a spell to discern things hidden from others. With it, you will be able to acquire the texts you need."
"Bring all four to me, and I shall use them to inscribe the spells for you."
I continue to hear things about dragon sightings in Skyrim.
"Dragons? Well, that's fascinating. We should have someone look into that."
"Would you like me to send someone? Faralda or Phinis, perhaps?"
I'll think about it.
Is it true? Are there really dragons in Skyrim?
"There's talk of it, but I find it hard to believe."
I do hope it's true. So many opportunities...
Opportunities for what?
"What? Oh, nothing. It's just... It's an interesting development."
"You haven't heard any more about dragon sightings, have you?"
"No, which is fine with me."
A pity. You have any idea how much fangs would be worth? Or even better -- bottle their flame. The right buyer would pay an immense amount.
"Bottle... their flame? I can't... No, I don't think I've any interest in that sort of thing."
"Folks have gone missing the past few weeks. Word now's that our hunters are gone, too."
"Say, if you're traveling, could you keep an eye out for them? Valdr and his men. I think they were after bear up north."
I just need a little to get going.
Thank you. Please hurry!
"Please, I need help! I don't want to die on this damned log!"
"It's done, then. Justice, if you can call it that."
"Look, I want you to have this. I know it isn't much, but it's important to me."
"Changed your mind? Well, I can't give up so easily. I'm heading back."
"Now that this is a Black-Briar Meadery, you can be sure that we'll be selling only the best mead in Skyrim."
What's left of the Honningbrew has been dumped into the sewers. Good riddance.
Maven Black-Briar always remembers her friends. That's why I'm in charge of the place.
"If you have anything you're having a hard time selling, I can take it off your hands."
"It was you, wasn't it. I should of known better. Now look at me."
You've sent an innocent man to jail. I hope your proud of yourself.
"Maven be damned. One day, she'll get hers. I can promise you that."
Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough damage already?
"Yes, lad? Did you need something?"
"Yes, lass? Did you need something?"
"Good to see you, lad! How are things?"
"Good to see you, lass! How are things?"
"Things are looking up around here, lass."
"Things are looking up around here, lad."
Planning some exciting heists I hope?
Enjoying your newfound abilities I trust?
What brings you back to Nightingale Hall?
I trust the night finds you well?
Things seem to be going well at the Guild.
I'm hearing good things about you from Brynjolf.
Hopefully they made it to safety before the attack.  I'll begin the search after a quick restock.
"Anyway, here is your reward.  Thanks again."
"An alchemy lab, it could be in here.  It's worth a look."
This looks like some sort of lever puzzle.  We'll have to figure out the correct order to flip them.
Maybe the order has something to do with the Symbols up there.
"I will see you dead, monster."
Stop! We know you're holding a Daedric artifact. Hand it over.
"The Vigil of Stendarr cleanses all Daedric filth from Tamriel. Give us any artifacts you have, or we'll purge you like all the others."
Then prepare yourself to receive Stendarr's Mercy.
"Five, four, three, two, one... go!"
"Five, four, three, two, one... go!"
I feel like I can beat anything.
I'm just itching for a fight.
I ain't scared of nothin'.
No one can defeat me.
I've never felt this brave.
Suddenly I feel like I can take on the world.
Bah! Is there no one who can offer a challenge?
I've never been more ready!
My claws are sharp. My will to kill... unquenchable.
I cannot be beaten!
"I may be old, but I can show 'em a trick or two."
I'm ready. Let's go!
Hmph. Everyone seems so insignificant now.
I'm ready. More than ready.
Come on! Let's go.
I feel... unbeatable.
"By the gods, I feel like I could crush a giant's head like a walnut."
Ha ha! Look out. Here I come!
There is none who can stand in my way.
"Come on, I can take anyone. And that ain't just the mead talkin'."
I feel like I can beat anyone.
Even my claws feel sharper.
"By Ysmir, I feel... invincible!"
Been too long since I've embraced my rage...
Just point me to the fight.
I fight and I'll win. Simple as that.
I feel like I can take on all of Skyrim.
"If you need to sample some of the finest mead in Skyrim, you're in the right place."
"If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the owner, Sabjorn."
"If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the brewmaster, Mallus."
"We're a small meadery, but growing quickly. Sabjorn's only been running this place for a short time now and look at it."
It's a shame the Black-Briar Meadery took this place over. I never liked it as much as our Honningbrew.
"Mallus is teaching me everything he knows about brewing. Hopefully, I can take over his position some day."
Welcome. I'm the owner and proprietor of Honningbrew Meadery.
"Honningbrew uses only the finest natural honey, not that sludge you'll find at Goldenglow Estate."
"We may be small, but what we lack in size we make up for in quality."
"Black-Briar Mead is just fine, if you need something to wash the dirt off a riding horse's hooves."
"You need something to do, or you just enjoy slowing down the hard-working folk?"
"If you want to buy something, go find Sabjorn. Otherwise, piss off."
"To tell you the truth, Sabjorn isn't much of an owner. Slave driver, sure."
I've never met someone like him that revels so much in other's misery.
"Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a mistake."
"The parchment you recovered mentions a [QUOTE]Gajul-Lei.[QUOTE] According to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts."
His real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.
Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude.
I'm betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and that he can finger our buyer.
"Get out there, shake him down and see what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have any questions."
They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for years. I'm impressed it reached this point.
Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
"You jest, but they've been able to avoid identification for years. They're obviously well-funded, driven and patient."
Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
"Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient and have been able to avoid identification for years."
"However, don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly."
"When Gulum-Ei was getting us merchandise from the East Empire Company, we were making a hefty profit."
"It was so lucrative, I was considering moving the Guild to Solitude to save us time."
Gulum-Ei started to get greedy and cut us out of the deal. Almost can't say I blame the scaly bastard.
It started out innocent enough; he kept claiming the shipments were light because of Imperial interference.
"Then, maybe a few years ago, it all stopped. He didn't even bother to contact us anymore."
Don't just walk away from me! Where do you think you're going?
"To the Inn for a drink, of course! Where else could I even go in this gods-forsaken town?"
"And what, you think that'll solve all your problems?"
"Probably not, but it's worth a try!"
Well in that case. You'll have to hand over your life as well as your coin.
We'll see about that. Won't we boys?
"Oh, thank goodness! I've been wandering alone for so long, I thought I'd never see another soul again."
I was kidnapped by these bandits weeks ago. They locked me up in the towers near Mistwatch.
"I managed to pick the lock and slip out while the guard slept, but now I'm completely lost. Can you help me, please?"
"Oh, thank you, but I should be fine now that you've shown me the way. But those bandits have to be stopped!"
"They're at Mistwatch. Here, let me show you on your map...."
"If you can stop them, you'll be a true hero!"
"Nothing to do now but sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip home."
"Years of work, finally going to pay off..."
...but what's this? These results... They're not at all what they should be.
Something is creating an incredible amount of interference.
"Something in Winterhold, it looks like."
What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?!
"Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we knew that some adjustments would have to be made."
"Heating and cooling the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change how the light passes through it."
"You'll need to use spells to do that. Being from the College, I assume you know them already."
There should be a few basic tomes around here somewhere in case your training is even more sub-standard than I've heard.
You'll have to get the crystal to focus properly. Heat and cold will affect it; simple concentration spells should be enough.
"You'll also need to align the mirrors using the controls up above. Once everything is lined up, the light will reflect back through the crystal."
Then you'll see some real magic.
Place the crystal in the center of the armillary. Then we can worry about attuning it.
"Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots. Good job."
The only grownups who talk to me are the kind I don't want talking to me.
Have I done something to make you bother me?
"You... you know the Whispering Lady, don't you. I can tell."
You're going to end up helping me. I know it.
"Kind of nice being in on the secret, itsn't it."
"Father says I'm too young to train with a sword, so I practice with my fists!"
Hope this war lasts long enough that I get to fight in it. Battle! Glory!
You're not from around here. I'll bet you're here to help with the war!
One of the new servants? Remember that I like my meat rare.
Absurd that you can't get good sweet rolls in this skeeverhole of a city.
Where is papa? I want to ride Karinda now!
"Blasted war. I was due a new dress from Solitude, but it will never get here."
"I'm sorry, could you describe the smell?"
"Like some horrible monster was turned inside out, and then exploded. What did you do?"
It was a minor miscalculation. I've already corrected it for future experiments.
"This, this is why people have a problem with your college, Nelacar."
"Heh, a Nord skull makes the best axe blade. 'bout all they're good for."
Lead the way.
"Then lead on, friend."
"We are in this together, yes?"
"Lead, then. You have my steel."
Let's not waste any time.
Looks like you've already got someone with you.
"You have someone with you, already."
"You have someone already, friend."
You already have someone to do your fighting for you. Don't need me.
Looks like you got someone already.
I'm right behind you.
You already appear to have someone with you.
You can't scare me into submission. Let's go.
"At last, a worthy opponent!"
"I used to dream of it. In the dream, I was standing... someplace high up... a tower, or mountain."
It was always just before dawn. The whole world was in darkness.
"Then came the flash of light - just on the horizon, within the clouds that mark the border between worlds."
"It could have been lightning, but there was no thunder. In the dream, the sense of foreboding grew, but I could never wake up."
"Then it came again, this time more distinct. Closer. Definitely not lightning now. It was orange - brilliant orange, the color of hearth and dawn."
"And a sound, too. Distinct and indistinct. Not thunder... something else. Something I should recognize, but in the dream I cannot place it."
"I want to leave my high place, to seek shelter. From what, I don't yet know."
"In the manner of dreams, I cannot escape. I'm forced to wait and watch."
"Then, finally, realization and horror arrive together. The orange is flame, heat. The sound a roar, a challenge in their ancient tongue."
But now it's too late for escape. The dragon is upon me - fire and darkness descending like a thunderbolt.
"And not just any dragon, but the Dragon - Alduin, the World-Eater, the dragon who devours both the living and the dead."
And then I would wake up. And hope that it was just a dream... but know that it was not.
Speak to Vex. We have nothing else to talk about.
The Guild will not tolerate the kind of behavior you've been displaying. Too much is at stake.
I'm taking you out of the game for now. No jobs will be offered and you won't be able to fence your goods.
Speak to Vex to make the proper reparations if you want back in. Now get out of my sight.
"Until you're done with Vex, we don't have anything to discuss."
"You've done it now, whelp. You broke the rules and now you're knee deep in it."
"That means your out. No jobs, no payouts... no nothing."
"You want to get back into our graces, you need to talk to Vex. She'll set you straight."
Sorry. We got nothin' to talk about. Vex will straighten you out.
Are you crazy? What were you thinkin'? You can't just go around doin' things the way you please!
Now we have to kick you out until things cool down. Can't give you any jobs or payouts for goods.
Go talk to Vex. She'll tell you the why's and how's if you want to get back in.
"Until you get back into the Guild's graces, we have nothing to speak about."
Straighten yourself out with the Guild and then maybe we can talk.
Don't want to know what you did and I don't care. Just keep away from me.
"I may be new around here, but at least I know how to follow the rules."
"Sorry, I'm not buying any goods until you straighten this out with Vex."
I'll serve you after you've paid Vex.
You better straighten things with the Guild or you won't be welcome here anymore.
"Settle your accounts with Vex, and then we can talk."
Hmph. I don't talk with Guild traitors.
Pay your dues and we'll speak.
It's a shame you got booted from the Guild... things were going so well.
Come back when you're in the Guild's good graces.
You want my advice? Pay your debt to Vex quickly and she'll forget the whole thing.
You're in it deep... better start shoveling your way out.
I'm surprised you're even showing your face around here after what you did.
"Well, well. If it isn't Brynjolf's little protege."
"I'm going to make this short and sweet, because frankly I don't think you deserve another shot."
You've broken the rules and now you need to pay... and it's going to cost you quite a bit.
"This is the Thieves Guild, genius. How do you think? With gold. A lot of gold."
Did you think we'd accept a heartfelt apology and let bygones be bygones?
I'd say it's time you put your nose to the grindstone and figure it out for yourself. You claim to be a thief... act like one.
"Pick pockets, knock over houses... heck, I don't care if you have to bust into a palace. You do what you have to do to come up with the coin."
"You'd better. Because until you do, you don't get a single coin from us... and you won't be able to use our fences."
"Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me."
Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full.
Again? Didn't we teach you enough of a lesson the first time?
I suppose it's tough for an old dog to learn new tricks.
"Anyway, you know the drill. You want to buy back in, and it'll cost you."
And here I expected you to hop the next caravan to Morrowind. What have you got for me?
I hope you brought a little something for me.
"First, let's count the coin, then we can get back to business."
"It's all here. Well, congratulations. You're one of us again."
"Next time you decide to pull a stunt like that again, just remember how much it hurt to give this away."
I hope you come up with that gold soon.
You have the gold yet or what?
I believe you owe the Guild something.
Got any ale or mead?
"First war, and now dragons. Everywhere they go, the Nords bring nothing but ruin."
Ain't nothing for it. They're still in charge.
"I wonder if we should finally leave Markarth. These dragon attacks, I think Skyrim is cursed."
What kind of talk is this? The man I married would never speak of leaving his home.
I just don't know if I can keep you safe.
We will keep each other safe. No matter what.
More settlements have sent riders to say dragons are being spotted throughout Skyrim.
The Forsworn ambush our roads and dragons cloud the skies. Is there any good news?
"Umm.... No, my Jarl. I'm afraid there isn't."
I want soldiers sent to deal with these dragons. Every able-bodied man and woman who can carry a bow.
We can't do that. Every soldier we send to hunt dragons is one more man that can't defend the Reach.
Killing dragons isn't defending the Reach?
"Our men know how to kill Forsworn and Legionnaires, not dragons."
Surprised to see you working. Mulush almost broke your arm yesterday.
Does it look like I can afford losing a day's wage? That damn Orc isn't getting the best of me.
"Oh, no."
"Dagur's been talking at you, hasn't he? Gotten you roped into his little plan to fix Ranmir's life?"
I'll tell you what I told him -- stay out of it. It's none of your business. Those aren't folks you want to get tangled up with.
No there isn't. And I suggest you leave it at that. I don't want to see anyone get hurt over this.
You'll wind up getting yourself killed. Dagur shouldn't have said a word about it.
"I love the man, bless his heart, but he doesn't know the whole story."
Enough to know that it's not worth it.
"Ranmir's a good boy, and he doesn't deserve what fate pushed his way, but there's only so far I'll go to risk my neck."
"One night Ranmir was in here like always, drinking himself to death."
"When I told him there was no more Honningbrew, that he'd drank it all, he got angry."
"He ranted at me, how I didn't know what he's been through, how Isabelle broke his heart when she ran off with some thief named Vex..."
"He said he'd even gone to Riften to try and find the bastard. I think maybe he was hoping they'd just kill him, and that'd be the end of it."
"Dagur never heard any of this, and I chose to keep it to myself. I'm only telling you so you don't get into trouble."
Riften and thieves means trouble. Just leave it alone.

"That remains to be seen. By rights, she has a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim."
"That's the real question, isn't it? No one can deny Elisif has a legitimate claim to become High Queen of Skyrim..."
"Well... By rights, she had a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim."
But now Skyrim is at Ulfric's mercy.
"The moot will meet and choose Ulfric as High King. With his troops in most of the cities, they have little choice."
Of course he does. What sort of a question is that?
"Maybe you've been listening to Erikur. There's been loose talk among some of the Thanes, and I suspect he's the cause of it."
You'll pay those rumors no heed if you wish to retain your welcome in this city.
"She may be young, but Elisif is the Jarl by right. And here in Skyrim, if nothing else, we respect the traditions of our father's fathers."
You'd do well to remember that.
Because killing her would yield no political advantage.
"By leaving Elisif alive, Ulfric completes the separation of the Empire and Skyrim."
"With Ulfric's troops here, Elisif will be forced to support his bid for High King. He secures the position and appears above reproach."
"What's more, Ulfric's refusal to execute his slain enemy's wife will be portrayed as the ultimate act of compassion. Hmph. It's genius, really."
"Oh, most certainly. At least, when Elisif herself asks."
"If you're inquiring whether we have concerns about her age and inexperience, well, let me put it this way..."
The Thanes have every confidence in General Tullius's leadership.
I don't suppose it matters much anymore.
"As long as Ulfric wishes Elisif to remain Jarl, remain Jarl she will. And the Thanes will continue to follow her orders."
As long as those orders came from Ulfric.
Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.
Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is no justice in the world.
Because that's what traitorous cowards do when they desire power.
Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.
And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare.
"When Ulfric unleashed such fury, my husband he... he simply ceased to be."
"That is all I will say, for it grieves me to speak of it."
Hmmm... A question I am all to familiar with. One my very Thanes ask often.
"They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people."
"The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him."
"Trust is always difficult, especially for my people. Yet we must trust in Tullius' leadership. For what other choice do we have?"
By Ysgramor!
For honor!
Glory awaits!
Yaaaargh!
Ffffeeeargh!
Rlyehhhgh1
Your depths will open to the mind!
Your length is cut!
Open to the will of Septimus!
Into the dark with you!
Cross the bridge at your own peril!
"The way is dangerous, and the gate will not open. You shall not gain entry!"
"Welcome to the College of Winterhold. I am Faralda, one of the senior Wizards here."
I trust you found your journey to Winterhold not entirely unpleasant.
"Now, I must advise you that if your only purpose in being here is to complain, you would be far better off speaking with the Jarl of Winterhold."
"If, however, you seek something more, I will be happy to assist you."
Is there some way I can assist you?
"Oh, forgive me."
Most who arrive here do so because they have heard of the College beforehand.
"This is the College of Winterhold, a safe haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge."
It is no great secret that we have been unjustly blamed for a great many things over the years.
The good people of Skyrim on occasion would rather pass judgment than attempt to understand what we do here.
Thus we must take certain precautions in order to secure our safety.
I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College.
"And if, in the process, my presence helps to deter those who might seek to do harm, so be it."
The more important question is: why are you here?
Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?
It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is what you can offer the College.
Not just anyone is allowed inside. Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic.
"A small test, if you will."
"If you can pass the test, then yes."
"I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you."
Do you?
It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls.
"But what you seek does not come easily, and can destroy those without a strong will."
"Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it."
Shhhhhh...
Shhhhhh...
That's definitely going in my part of the Edda.
"Sorry, I need to pay attention so I can remember this."
A man opens a gate and they cut his head off? Doesn't seem right to me.
I guess it's all over. I expected... I don't know what I expected.
Roggvir always talked about his honor. Seems to me honorable men don't get executed.
They should have drawn it out some more. He deserved a slower death.
"Excuse me, I'm trying to watch a traitor to the Empire lose his head."
Roggvir... Why did it have to be like this?
That's my brother up there.
I still can't believe he knew what he was doing when he opened that gate...
Can we talk later?
"Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them."
Best to keep clear.
Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged in. You can taste the fear.
"There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so."
"Nobody we know, by the smell."
Some can't separate the animal from themselves. Go feral. This poor sod could have been anyone.
We should keep moving.
Nothing we can do for these ones now.
Don't even want to think about what those cretins did to them before they died.
No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.
We're getting close now. Be careful. Their leader is a tricky one.
They call him [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
They call her [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
I don't think I need to tell you why.
Perhaps some other time.
I stand where I have always stood. Here in Morthal.
Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves. I fear dark days approach and all of Skyrim's strength will be needed.
"That's what many here wanted. A quiet life in a quiet place, without the noise or the trouble of a city."
"Now some worry this wizard, Falion, will foul it all up."
"The people still doubt me, don't they."
"No, not at all. It's just..."
"It does not surprise me. They do not share in what I see, and I cannot explain it to them."
"Just guide them well, and all will work out."
"I have never doubted that, husband."
Have you made a decision about Falion?
What decision is there to be made? I allowed him to live here. I stand by that.
"Yes, but there are concerns. Rumors that he's up to something."
"We are all up to something, my dear. All is as it should be."
"What troubles you, husband?"
"What? Oh, nothing. All is well."
It's Joric. I fear his condition is worse.
He calls out in his sleep sometimes. I've heard Falion's name. What does it mean?
Joric will be what Joric will be. Give it time.
"Still, I fear there is some connection."
How's business?
Very funny.
"No, I... I was just asking."
It's as bad as ever.
When are you gonna do somethin' to help Falion? Stop people sayin' things about him?
"You have to understand, his presence here has caused... Well, it's difficult for the people to get used to."
"They got used to Idgrod just fine, didn't they? So what's the difference?"
"Yes, well. Perhaps you're right."
"What are you hiding, priest?"
I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason.
"Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping us from seeing our honored dead?"
You and the Jarl will answer for any desecration of my ancestors' bodies.
"The mine will be the talk of Skyrim soon, you'll see. It'll be the stuff of legends."
"It's a matter of time before the Jarl is coming to me asking for money. This mine is going to make me... I  mean us, rich."
I know they laughed when I said I wanted to keep the mine open. I'll show them. I'll show them all.
"You're welcome to look around, of course, but understand that this place belongs to me."
"Thorgar says we'll find rocks soon, the kind worth gold."
I'm the best at breaking up rocks. Thorgar says so.
"It's cold in the mine, but Thorgar really needs me, so I stay."
"Be careful where you step in the mine. Don't want to cover up some valuable ore, or gems, or... Or something..."
"Any time I get tired of working, I just think that maybe that next swing will make me rich. It keeps me going."
"It's going to happen soon, I just know it. We'll strike something better than iron. Silver, or maybe even gold. You'll see."
"We were supposed to be rich by now, you know. Thorgar insisted we'd be swimming in gold."
I'm starting to think we might not even find iron in here. We've been at it for so long.
"Is it still worth it? When do you decide enough is enough, and just walk away?"
You can't catch me!
Hahaha!
<Giggling>
You're it!
Got you!
You're too slow!
"I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works."
"The door is hidden, but I will show you the way."
"Aela will be joining us shortly. Once she's inside, we can follow."
Are you prepared?
Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was.
And the Underforge taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves.
"We bring you here to make you stronger, new blood. Now let's move."
"This is no test, new blood. This is a gift. Come inside."
"I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form."
She's agreed to be your forebear.
"Are you prepared to join your spirit with the beast world, friend?"
Very well.
Are you awake?
I was starting to think you might never come back.
"You were born into the pack, brother."
"You were born into the pack, sister."
I almost envy you. That first time is always the most... intense.
You gave us even more trouble than Farkas did at his first turning.
"You have the blood of the wolf in you. You'll need to build up your strength before you can call on it again, though."
Just be careful where you do it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before them.
"Nothing, until you choose to use it."
"Then, well... you got a taste. Stronger, faster."
"It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes can sustain you. If you're willing to feed."
Cure? Hah. You're sounding like the old man.
I... shouldn't say that.
I love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land.
"If he's worried about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it. I'll take the glories of the hunt right here."
Oh! You got me!
Argh!
Ha! You caught me!
"Hold it. This here's a toll road, see? Yer gonna have to hand over, say, 200 gold if you want to use our road."
"Wise move. Now get out of here ya goat licker, before I decide the toll's gone up."
That's a real shame. Gonna make it hard for you to pay a healer after we cave your skull in.
Get on your way before I change my mind.
Go on. Get lost.
"Should have left when you had the chance, friend. Now we're gonna have to spill your brains on the road here."
"You know, now that I think of it, that sounds fair. Just shove off before the others notice."
Ha! Tough talk for someone who's about to have their guts spilled.
"Eh, fine. I can tell you aren't worth the trouble. Just get out of here before I change my mind."
How does a knife in the gut sound? It's 200 gold or your life.
You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?
"Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself."
So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?
"Well, yes, but... there's no guarantee, of course."
"Sky Haven Temple it is, then. I knew you'd have something for us, Esbern."
Always. Let's go see if we can find this Sky Haven Temple.
From Riverwood? The road south through Falkreath is the most direct route.
Or you could catch the carriage from Whiterun to Markarth and then approach from the west.
"Either way, the Reach is wild country these days. The Forsworn are everywhere. Best be careful."
We'll meet you there. Be careful. That part of the Reach is rough country these days.
"Yes, exactly. Well, I think so. It's certainly our best hope. The ancient Blades remembered much Akaviri dragonlore that has now been forgotten."
"This is what I've been trying to explain. It's in Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach."
That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.
"Orgnar, this is it. The inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back here."
"Well, now. That's something to think about."
"Take care of yourself, Orgnar. Goodbye."
"Yeah... sure. You, too, Delphine. You be safe."
"Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return."
"Thank you. Please, do not open it. It is... private."
I understand.
"The Divines reveal things to me at times, yes. I do not hide this."
It is a gift. Anyone who believes otherwise does not and cannot understand it.
"If you stand before me to accuse me of sacrificing children, or eating the hearts of the dead, you may save your breath."
"I have done no such thing, nor do I intend to. I simply wish to live my life in peace."
The people of Morthal would much rather weave their own horrid tales about my life than simply ask me for the truth.
"If they choose to fear me in their ignorance, that is their choice. But it will not change what is true."
"I keep to myself. I offer spells and scrolls to those who need them, and wisdom in Conjuration magic for those who wish to learn."
Beyond that I seek only to be left alone to pursue my research.
You will not disrespect Jarl Idgrod while in this Hall. Do we have an understanding?
"Then by all means, go about your business."
It's no secret that Jarl Idgrod is... different. It's also no secret that there are rumors about her and her visions.
"I won't repeat them, and I won't allow them to be spread under this roof."
"Now, you go about your business."
No? Then how do you like the idea of having your legs broken?
"Mind your manners in this hall, friend."
"Why, good evening Jonna!"
Is it true that you kill deer and eat their hearts?
What? Where did you hear such a thing?
I don't know. Someone in town said it.
"It's not true, I assure you."
Okay.
"Don't believe everything you hear, child."
"You are looking after your brother, yes?"
"Yes, mother."
Good. He must be kept safe from harm.
What sort of harm? Have you had a vision?
"No, no. Just watch over him."
"I will be Jarl someday, mother?"
"That is what the Divines have planned for you, yes."
Have you... Do you see that future? Will I be a good leader?
"All things are possible, my child. But I believe it is within you to succeed."
"You are troubled, Gorm."
"No, no. I'm fine. Is there something you need?"
"No, Gorm. I am simply telling you what I see."
"Yes, okay. Well thank you."
"How are you feeling, Jarl Idgrod?"
"The visions continue to hold me in balance, Gorm."
"So, the same then."
"Do not worry, my friend. All is well."
"All right, you want to go?"
"Watch it, there, brother."
"Watch it, there, sister."
Look at that.
That someone would attack Jorrvaskr... it's unthinkable.
Hmm?
You don't look so good. Are you feeling all right?
You should probably be in bed. You're looking a bit under the weather.
How do you feel? I think you might be sick.
You look sick. I hope it's not contagious.
"Are you feeling all right, dear? You look a little ill."
"Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little sickly."
You're looking a little rough around the edges. You feeling all right?
"You look a bit peaked. You sure you shouldn't be home, in bed?"
You look worse than I feel.
Are you feeling sick?
You look awful. Better not get me sick.
You all right? You look like you might be sick.
"No offense, but you're not looking so good. Are you feeling ill?"
Don't let Viola catch you in her house.
Sneak that ring back to Viola before we both get caught.
Have you taken care of that... little problem?
Remember. I need that bandit dead. Not alive.
Bandits are cowards. Don't strain yourself chasing them all down.
Show those marauders what Windhelm justice tastes like.
"Vampires are clever hunters. More clever than you, definitely."
I want no mercy for those Forsworn. Understand?
Good luck with the giant. Don't get stepped on.
Execute every last bandit. Spare no one.
Retrieve that shield at all costs.
Come back as soon as you have the helm.
"If you find that sword, please bring it to me."
"If you find that ring, bring it here."
"That journal means a lot to me, if you find it."
I do miss that helmet....
"Hopefully, that story about Lenne's Shield is true."
"Don't forget. You find Queen Freydis's Sword, I'll reward you."
This looks promising.
Yes. Definitely early Akaviri stonework here.
We've got to get this bridge down.
These pillars must have something to do with it.
Yes. These are Akaviri symbols.
Let's see... you have the symbol for [QUOTE]King[QUOTE]... and [QUOTE]Warrior[QUOTE]...
And of course the symbol for [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE] That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing downward at the bottom.
"Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the left."
"Yes, that's it. The symbol on the middle pillar."
"Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the right."
"Given that Sky Haven Temple was sealed against the return of the Dragonborn, I would try turning all the pillars to that symbol."
"Whatever you did, it worked. Let's see what else those old Blades left in our way."
Wait.
Why are you stopping?
We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?
"Hmm, Esbern's right. Look like pressure plates."
I would suggest staying on the plates with the Dragonborn symbol.
Be careful.
There should be a way to turn this off.
We'll cross once it's safe.
Looks safe now. Let's move.
"Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance."
"Esbern, look out!"
"Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you?"
What do you see from that little cage? Speak.
Yes. It's an altar. Men would come and sacrifice the wretched in my name. The weak would be punished by the strong.
"But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate the altar. Until you came."
"Yes. Your reward is waiting for you, mortal. Further down."
Rusted. Dry. There was a time when this mace dripped with the blood of the feeble and the worthless.
"But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. Left it here to decay. Until you came."
"Rescue? No one knew where I was, when I was taken. Who sent you?"
"The Mace of Molag Bal! I give you its true power, mortal."
"When your enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be watching."
"Now, I have a soul in Oblivion that needs claiming. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!"
"Know your place, mortal. Or Molag Bal may just send another champion to claim his mace from your broken corpse."
"Now, I have a soul in Oblivion to claim. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!"
"Got a witchhunter in town, from the Priesthood of Stendarr. Keeps asking questions about that old abandoned house."
A witchhunter from the Priesthood of Stendarr is in town. He's asking a lot of questions about that old abandoned house.
We are on the hunt.
Meat from fresh kills.
"What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?"
"You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire."
Well. I'll let it slide this time. But you'd be smart to take that off. Someone might get the wrong idea.
"Hmm. I still don't like it, but I guess I'll overlook it. This time."
You don't seem to realize there's a war on. What you are is a damn Imperial spy!
Is that right? Here's how the Legion deals with rebel scum like you.
I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my sister will be glad to help you out.
See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. I never understood how my sister could stand living in the shadow of that place.
"Remember, this isn't Stormcloak territory. If we're ahead of the news from Helgen we should be fine as long as we don't do anything stupid."
"If we run into any Imperials, just let me do the talking, all right?"
I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my uncle will be glad to help you out.
"See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. When I was a boy, that place always used to give me nightmares."
"Listen, as far as I'm concerned you've already earned your pardon."
"But until we get that confirmed by General Tullius, just stay clear of other Imperial soldiers and avoid any complications, all right?"

I hear you've been busy of late.
"Oh? Well, I won't turn down your money."
"By helping me, you're helping the good folk of Whiterun. How could I say no to that?"
"I'll take your money, but I make no promises of a large return on your investment. These are troubled times, after all."
"Splendid! With the extra coin, I'll be able to purchase twice the volume in supplies that I normally do."
"I've been looking to expand the business, and your investment will certainly help with that. I accept!"
"Such an investment will mean that I can take better care of my family, as well as my customers."
"An investment, is it? Alright, I'm sure I can put the extra money to good use."
Splendid! I've been looking for a new investor. Now it seems my search is over.
"Come to see the hag with an offering of coin, then? So be it. I accept your investment."
Of course you want to invest in my business. I'm the finest blacksmith in all Skyrim.
"How kind. At my age, I've certainly learned how to spend wisely."
"You want to give me money? Just like that? Fine, but I intend to earn that investment. I don't need handouts."
"Ah yes, good idea. Best to let a professional businessman handle that money for you."
"You make an interesting offer. Very well, I'm sure that I can put the extra coin to good use."
"An investment? Very well, I don't see why not."
"You have my thanks, friend."
"Ah, the sound of clinking coins. Even better, the sound of clinking coins in my hand!"
I'll call upon my suppliers this very evening and arrange to double my orders.
I'll start planning how best to spend this. You have my thanks!
"You'll look back on this as one of your best decisions, I swear it."
"If you want to make the most of your investment, you'll come here to sell your goods."
"Thank you so much! With this coin, I'll be able to double my stock."
"Ah, look at the pretty, shiny coins. Now, how best to spend them?"
"If you have spare weapons and armor to sell, bring them here."
"More coin means more supplies, and that means more useful balms, potions and remedies for everyone."
I'll work hard to justify your faith in me.
"A wise choice, my friend. After all, what would a common adventurer know about the complexities of finance?"
Wise is the one who spends a few coins now to make a fortune later.
"Thank you. When I have the time, I'll try to think of how best to use this."
May prosperity bless us both!
Excellent. I think you'll be glad that you made this decision.
"If you change your mind, you know where to find me."
Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use.
No! You'll never take me alive!
"Take the money, just let us go..."
"Shut up or they'll kill us, you idiot! Once they're gone I'll pick the lock..."
"Come on... there! I got it, let's go!"
"Hey, Longhammer, set us up with a round of... what in Oblivion happened in here?"
Hey! What the... keep your damn magic to yourself.
What the... Don't do that!
Keep your damn spells to yourself.
That was pathetic. It didn't even do anything.
Ah! Damn wizard. Keep your spells off of me.
Stop that! Keep your spells to yourself.
"Don't try to magic me, you damn wizard."
Hey! What are you trying to pull?
Huh? Don't do that!
"Don't know what that was, but don't try it again."
Hey! Stop that.
Magic is for the weak. Pick up some steel if you want to fight me.
Wizards. There oughta be a law against them.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa? What did you do?"
Ah! Keep your spells away from me.
Ah! Don't do that.
Ah! I'm just an old woman. Don't hurt me.
You stop that! I will not be violated by some... half-Septim magician!
Oh! What did you just do?
Hey! I didn't ask you to magic me.
Hey! Don't do that.
Ah! Picking on an old man? What did I ever do to you?
Oh! I don't feel any different. What did you do?
Stop it! I don't like magic.
Wow! That was fun. Do it again!
Ah Please! Don't hurt me!
You there! That was uninvited. No more.
What was that? Don't do it again.
Huh... what was that? What'd you do?
I did not ask for that! No more magic.
My thanks. I feel... better.
I suppose you think you're better than me because you can do that?
I hope you're not expecting a thank you.
A healing spell? Was that really necessary?
Huh. I feel better now.
My old bones don't hurt so much now.
Healing magic? An Orc lets her wounds heal naturally...
Huh? What...oh! That felt nice.
What...hey! That felt good.
No need to do that now.
Suddenly I feel much better.
You heal away my scars and there's gonna be a problem...
That put a spring in my step.
Hey! You trying to pull a fast one on me?
Save it for the battlefield.
"I wasn't hurt, but that did make me feel better."
A healing spell? Are you a priest?
Don't go casting spells on a woman without asking her permission.
Thanks!
Hmm. Feel a bit better now. Thanks.
Was that some sort of... healing spell?
"Thanks! Not sure it was necessary, though."
Healing spells always leave me light-headed...
Ah! What did you do? Stop that!
Mmm. That felt nice.
Ah! That felt refreshing.
Wow! What was that? Do it again!
Hey! My hangover is gone!
Ah! I feel like I just woke from a nap.
I...I'm fading away!
Now what am I supposed to do? I can't be seen in public like this. If I can even be seen at all...
You turned me invisible!
Not bad. Now turn me back.
I'm...I'm invisible!
What did ya do that for?
"Bah! Save your magic. A warrior should face her foe, not hide from him."
Ooohh... The things I could do now...
Hey! Where did I go?
Magic! I'm not sure I approve.
You're a tricky one. Now fix it.
Hey! I can't see myself! What did you do to me?
Wizard tricks! An Orc faces the enemy. He doesn't hide from him.
Stop that! How can I do my job if I'm invisible?
"Clever. To think, now I could... Well, never mind."
Ahhh... no one will know I'm here now.
"What did you do to me? What am I made of? Air? Shadow? Oh, this is not good..."
What the...I'm invisible!
Goodness!
What did you do! I'm...I'm see through! This better not be permanent. You can't just go around making women invisible like this!
Oh! I didn't expect that!
What have you done to me?
Hey! Where did I go? I can't see myself!
Hey! This could be handy!
Ah! I am now like the Shadowscales of old.
Hmm. I could be a great hunter like this.
Wow! I'm see through!
Hey! What did you do to me? My body is gone!
What? Do I have mead on my chin?
"I'd appreciate if you don't bother my wife, Tova. She's still in mourning."
"Oh, this pendant would look lovely on my sister."
"By the Divines, the Forsworn are here in the city!"
Everyone stay back. The Markarth city guard have this all under control. There are no Forsworn here.
"By the gods, that man nearly killed me. You saved my life."
"Thank you. Here, I was going to bring this to my sister, but I think you should have it."
Thank you again. I can't believe I was this close to being killed.
No. I don't have any idea. I was just shopping for a pendant for my sister back in the Imperial City.
I've heard of them. Something about the men who live in the hills and attack caravans.
I'm sorry. I don't know anymore. I'm just visiting here from Cyrodiil.
Don't come too close with that.
Get away from me!
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
That spell looks dangerous...
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
Please! Keep that magic away from me.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
You really should be more careful with the spells you cast.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
You should be more careful with your spell casting.
You keep your distance with that magic
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
"Dear, that spell is making me nervous."
Hurt anyone with that spell and you'll be sorry.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
Uuh. Would you mind dousing that magic?
It's wearing a dangerous spell...
That spell looks like it'll hurt.
That looks dangerous...
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
Please stay away while you got that spell on you.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
Don't hurt me!
Keep your distance.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
Walking around like that is why magic gets a bad name. Shame on you.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
This one thinks you should be more careful with your spells.
You're asking for trouble walking around with dangerous magic like that.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
"Do be careful with that spell, will you?"
"You better be careful with that magic, if you know what's good for you."
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
I trust you know what you're doing with that spell?
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
We left to help with the war and these filth bags swooped in and seized the place.  My family is in there.
There's no way out. There's no way out....
Out the way we came. Hurry!
We're getting out of here. Now.
See if you can get the door open.
Something's going on here.
Eyes open.
"Haven't you talked to Astrid? She's by the pool, greeting the Night Mother and her little jester. She has a contract for you. Come see me afterward."
"Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!"
"What? You want it for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - don't you? I won't let her have you!"
"I've heard Jaree-Ra is hanging around the Wells District, looking for new blood to hire."
"Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!"
"Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there."
"Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first."
"Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you."
This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in.
"Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for, but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around."
"After we're done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild Master Armor."
"Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this. It's sort of a tradition around here."
"Yes, and I'm more than happy to give it to you."
I mean look at this place. I've never seen so much wealth down here. You've made us all rich.
Here you go... should fit you like a glove... boss.
I had another run-in with the Thieves Guild.
"Be careful, Mjoll. The Thieves Guild has Maven Black-Briar at her back."
"One snap of her fingers, and you could end up in Riften Jail... or worse."
"They represent the reason I'm here. I can't just ignore them, Aerin."
I know. I just don't want you to leave; you're the only good thing that's happened to this city in a long time.
I'll meet you outside!
"Oh, really? You're just like my brother. Fine, but if you change your mind, I'll be right here."

"What? Who is this, Brother? Another of the smooth skins looking for food? But this one wasn't trapped with us..."
"Thank you for your help with Vals. Please, take this and leave me to see to Aunt Agna and my other family members."
Oooh... pretty colors.
What a display of color!
"Oh, such colors!"
"Is that magic? Careful, please..."
"Oh, look at the colors!"
Wow! Look at all the colors!
Colorful...
Whoa.
Brilliant!
Keep that magic away from me.
"Well hey, that's not something you see every day."
Guard. Prepare the prisoner.
I don't need your help.
Thank you for your time.
"Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head."
Not right now.
A traitor right up to the end.
I've been waiting for Roggvir's execution. Talk to me later.
Go away.
They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.
Of course! You don't remember getting here.
"Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes."
"You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar."
"You're all heart, Vivienne."
"No! Aunt Agna! Talos, why didn't I go in with her?"
He's barred the door. Gods only know how he's... defiling the bodies of my ancestors in there!
Agna once told me there is a secret room deeper in where they buried disgraced members of the family. Maybe that will get us into the main chamber...
This looks like the area Agna told me about. She said that the bear would show the way...
You found it! The passage goes through the sarcophagus... I don't like this... but we'd better keep going.
"We're not killing them, they were already dead. We're helping them back to Sovngarde."
Vals Veran will die for what he's done.
That dark elf is about to be a dead elf.
"The dead should be made to serve the living, not the other way around!"
"Sovngarde is a myth, you s'wit! And now you can join your ancestors in service to me!"
"I'll return my ancestors to Sovngarde, and you with them!"
I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat.
Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the temple.
You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a staff?
"Ha! We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started."
"Well come back when you do, my friend. Come back when you do."
I'll start round one. Down the hatch!
Your turn!
"One down, my friend. One down."
Sorry to hear that.
And another one for me.
And how about you?
"So says you. I think I've hit my limit on these things. Tell you what, one more and you win the contest."
"Awww, well, maybe next time."
Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.
"You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little place where the wine flows like water. We should head there."
"Hey, you don't look so good..."
Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.
"What do you say, Irileth? You're being awfully quiet."
"Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?"
Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about.
But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.
"That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are Dragonborn, then..."
"Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them."
"If you really are Dragonborn, like out of the old tales, you ought to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?"
Go ahead... try to Shout.
Have you tried to Shout?
They say the Dragonborn can Shout without any training. Like Talos himself...
"I've heard the Empire plans to levy a tax on our trading ships. Falk, you've got to do something about this."
General Tullius needs more money for the war effort. We need the funds to arm and provision more troops.
Then let's increase the taxes on the farms and merchants. We can't afford to lose the loyalty of the ship captains.
"We know full well about your investment in shipping ventures, Erikur."
"I've also heard troubling rumors about dealings between you and the crew of that pirate ship, the Red Wave."
"Thankfully, Jarl Elisif cares far less about your lost profits than she does about winning the war!"
The Jarl would be wise to remember that it is her thanes - and my profits - that are paying for this war.
"There's something that's been troubling me, Falk. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must."
"Speak your mind, Bryling. You're among friends here."
"You know that I support the Empire, as we all do. However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks."
Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously.
"If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all."
"We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this."
"And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards."
"Yes, of course, but Ulfric's message is a powerful one. More of our people flock to his cause every day."
"Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more."
"It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling."
We'll need to visit each home for an assessment.
Is it that time again already?
"Very well, let's meet this evening and make the arrangements."
"Oh, well done. Very subtle."
I beg your pardon?
"Oh, I'm sorry, did I imply that you'd be meeting for purposes other than court business? You must forgive me."
"Hold your tongue, Wizard, or you're likely to lose it."
"I should very much like to see you try it, my dear steward."
"Stop it, both of you. You're acting like children."
"Steward Falk, I have a task for you."
"I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally."
"A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare."
General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.
"General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?"
"My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort."
"There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war."
Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with with the general in person.
"I will make the arrangements, my Jarl."



"Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time."
"I think we shall have a grand parade, and let General Tullius march his troops from the Blue Palace to Castle Dour in all their finery."
"What a... fine idea, my Jarl. However, I would suggest we wait until the war has ended."
"After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks."
"I must protest, my Jarl."
A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.
"Oh, very well. I can see there's no changing your stubborn Nord minds."
"But when this war is won, I will have my parade!"
"Yes, my Jarl."
"We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl."
"If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city."
"Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing."
"It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly."
"Told you that, did he?"
"I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense."
The first line is the walls around this city and the men who patrol them.
"Men who, I might add, we're precious short on."
"I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication."
"However, if we lose the war, the guardsmen of Solitude will make little difference in the end."
"No disrespect toward the general, but sometimes I wonder if he's got your best interests at heart."
"In any case he won't be turnin' me into no Imperial soldier. I know my place, and it's at your side."
"It comforts me to know that, Bolgeir."
Old Nord sacrifice place. Be careful around here. Let's look for a way to open the bars.
"Ah, the ceremonial juncture. The old Nords used to do sacrifices here. Look around for a way to open those bars."
"The only thing I heard is a rumor that a boy named Aventus Aretino, in Windhelm, has been attempting to contact the Dark Brotherhood."
He used to live here in Riften at the Orphanage on the other side of town but I think he ran away. Can't say I blame him.
"They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground."
Why? You think it's funny or something?
"What, you still think it's funny?"
"I already told you. They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground."
Oh yeah? I think so too. You're pretty smart.
"Hey, here. Have one on the house."
Good. Now shut up and get out of my face.
"No, no. Sorry if I sounded so mean there. My brother always said I have a big mouth."
"Here, have one on me."
"Yeah, my problem is I'm too tired to punch your face in."
Already did.
Maul? Yeah. That jerk works for Maven Black-Briar now. Left me down here watching this garbage heap.
I guess he's better at all that talking stuff anyway. I'd just mess everything up.
"The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood, Dragonborn."
We should be careful. There's no telling what traps and wards the ancient Blades may have set.
The entrance must be past the Forsworn camp. Look for a canyon or cave entrance into the Karthspire.
"Ah, yes. The entrance seems to be near what's now known as the Karthspire. We'll have to see what we find when we arrive."
Very good. I'll trust you to get there in one piece. Don't be long.
Your call. Might be safer to travel separately - attract less attention that way.
"Don't worry, I'll get Esbern there in one piece. We'll wait for you near Karthspire. Good luck."
Well...that's disappointing. This one didn't survive the fall either.
No matter. Another one will be along any time now.
I'm sorry! This isn't what I want!
I don't want to do this!
I don't have any choice! I'm sorry!
Is someone there? Stay back! I don't want to attack you.
Stay away!
Stay back or I'll be forced to attack you!
"Are you a member of the College, or did you just steal those robes from a real wizard?"
You must be one of those wizards. From the College in Winterhold.
Wow! Look at that robe. Are you a wizard?
"Those are College of Winterhold robes, aren't they?"
Fancy robes. You a wizard or somethin'?
I like your robes. Are you a sorcerer? From the College?
"It will keep it's hands to itself, yes?"
Umm... are you in trouble? Is that why you're hiding like that?
I hope you're not planning on picking my pocket.
What? Why are you skulking about like that?
"Look at you, up to no good."
"You remind me of the Shadowscales, from the old histories."
Are you playing hide and seek?
I trust you aren't considering any... thievery.
"You're not a thief trying to rob me, right?"
You trying to hide? 'Cause I can see you plain as day.
You're a bad sneak. You're not creeping up on anybody like that.
"You, my friend, need practice..."

Can you help me? He's in the tomb doing Gods know what with my dead relatives.
Vals Veran. My family has never really seen eye to eye with him and he has finally gone off the deep end.
He's gone in to defile our family tomb by using our ancestors for his filthy dark elf necromancy.
"No offense, I mean I'm sure you aren't into any of that kind of stuff."
"My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I'm afraid to go in by myself."
"My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I don't think I can take him by myself."
"Fine, but I've locked the door so don't think you're getting in there without me."
Where is he? The one who was asking about the fugitive hiding in the Ratway?
"You're in the wrong place to be asking those kind of questions, pal."
No. Not yet.
You'd better clear out before someone gets hurt.
Your lack of cooperation has been noted. We'll be back if we require further information. You won't get a second chance.
The answer ain't gonna be any different the next time. Arrogant elven bastard.
I'm... I'm sorry you had to see that.
I hope I didn't scare you.
It's a blessing given to some of us. We can be like wild beasts. Fearsome.
"Come on now, you're a sharp one. You must have heard of werewolves before."
It's a blessing given to the most honored of the Companions.
"Oh, no. Only the Circle have the beastblood. Prove your honor to be a Companion."
"[QUOTE]Eyes on the prey, not the horizon.[QUOTE]"
"No, only members of the Circle get this blessing. Right now we're just seeing if you're worth keeping around."
"Breathe deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs."
"I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of mine."
"In a sense, but no more poisoned than a fool after too much wine."
"Well. You must have all those annoying gods on your side to have made it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit, that's pretty impressive."
You had your chance to talk!
We could always use help picking crops if you need a few extra coins.
"Mining is hard work, but we pay a fair price for any ore you dig up."
"Are you looking to work? The mines are nearby. You bring me ore, I'll give you coin."
I'll buy everything you've dug up.
"There is an empty home in the city, but there was some... unpleasantness recently. I'm afraid it's not available just yet."
It's abandoned and it's always been abandoned.
"Excuse me, but do you know anything about this house? Seen anyone enter or leave?"
Seems no one in this city has.
I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone watch my back.
"Follow me, and keep your eyes open. Daedra are powerful creatures and tricksters. Never know what you'll find."
You there. Are you here to kill me? Slay the mighty Logrolf while he sits tied and helpless?
"Praise to you, champion!"
"Ah, the new disciple. I hear you have quite the appetite."
"It's an honor, Keeper of the Ring."
You've brought us quite the meal.
You were given Namira's ring? A great honor.
I remember my first feast. I envy you.
I'm so glad Eola invited you to dinner.
Namira spoke to you? I knew this feast was going to be something.
Now this is going to be a good feast.
"Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that spiced beef, now."
You buy a war dog from me? There's a reason why my hounds are so eager to bite into people.
That's right. You're the sellsword. Thank you again. It's so nice to have help with my husband gone. Shame what happened to him.
One of my customers? Did you know I inherited the store from my late husband? Shame what happened to him. He had such good taste.
[QUOTE]The bloodiest beef in the Reach![QUOTE] Ha ha ha.
Shh. You mustn't speak about such things away from the shrine. Only you and your dinner guests can know.
"Better if we don't talk about that. As far as anyone's concerned, we all had dinner at a nice inn along the road, and nothing strange happened."
Don't go talking about that. Only the dinner guests can know.
It's so good to have everyone around the table again.
Eola is a fine host. She really keeps the faithful together.
"I'm just glad we had this, now. I was almost getting ready to eat my servant and blame it on the Forsworn."
"When was your first meal, Banning?"
Do dogs count?
Of course they don't count!
"My friend Marex. We were hunting, and I thought he was an elk."
That must have been quite a surprise.
"Either way, I came back with meat for the table."
The toes are my favorite part. I hope I get to take a few home with me.
I always preferred the liver myself. My brother had such a juicy liver.
"Thank you for coming to dinner, Hogni."
I never miss a good meal.
"This is lovely, as always, Eola."
"Thank you, Lisbet. It's been such a joy to dine with you all these years."
"Not too full on bread and wine, I hope?"
"I always leave room for the main course, Eola."
"Oh my, yes. I absolutely love weddings. I haven't found my special someone yet, but there's still hope. Vittoria is, well, getting up in years..."
"Am I! Free food and wine, and nobody trying to throw me in the dungeon. I wish they did weddings here every day."
"Not really. It's just a bunch of elders standing around, looking important. I wish something exciting would happen."
"Oh. Why... why certainly. I keep telling myself I'm not losing a son, I'm gaining an Imperial. Daughter. An Imperial daughter..."
"No, I'm not having a good time. My boy just married a gods-forsaken Imperial. Skyrim is full of eager Nord women, and he beds down with the enemy."
"The best. Vittoria's a good woman. Any man should be so lucky. I know my father's not happy about me marrying an Imperial, but that's his problem."
"I most certainly am not. I've just lost my daughter to a Nord beast, and my nephew Titus is too busy playing Emperor to even show up."
"I am, thank you. I do so enjoy singing at weddings. It's just one of the many duties we at the Bards College are called upon to perform."
"So far. I just hope things remain calm. Wine gets drunk, tempers flare. This may be a joyous celebration, but it's shadowed by a lot of animosity."
"Oh, yes. Presiding over the union of two lovers is one of my greatest responsibilities. It helps that Asgeir and Vittoria truly care for each other."
She's dead! On my watch! This won't stand!
"I'm just here to provide protection for his eminence's cousin. Please, enjoy yourself."
Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight. I'll find the release.
Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted? I had to let the whole plan fall through.
"Well, at least you didn't do anything stupid. Next time, when you're given a job, don't wander off or take your sweet time."
I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.
"Are you daft? This isn't the Dark Brotherhood! We don't go around murdering anyone, ever. It just isn't how things are done."
I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.
I guess I expected too much from you.
Looks like I chose the right person for the job.
"It's good we hold the Reach. Were the rebels to gain control, the silver mines would give them coin to hire more thugs and expand their violence."
It was important we reclaimed the Reach. Letting Ulfric control the flow of silver was a mistake. One I'm glad we've finally corrected.
"We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence."
Hjaalmarch is an important buffer zone between the rebel forces and the capital. Ulfric will try to break through at some point.
"Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long."
I'm losing my patience with this damn war. We must take Hjaalmarch back! The Stormcloaks will be beating upon the doors of the capital soon.
Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.
I can't believe we lost Whiterun. The rebels have a great advantage in controlling the center now. We must take it back!
"By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him."
"By taking back Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. We should never have given it up."
"I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back."
"Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?"
Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.
"Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until I'm ready to march on Windhelm."
"There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home."
"I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting."
"We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate."
Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.
We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.
I almost can't believe it. The Empire has been defeated. The world bears witness to the power and righteousness of the sons and daughters of Skyrim.
"Soon enough we will march on Solitude. And on that day the heroes of Sovngarde will march with us, and the Empire will fall to its knees in fear."
Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim.
"The Empire's ravenous hunger for Skyrim's silver makes them fierce. But rest assured, we'll win the Reach and wrest it from their greedy paws."
"Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude."
We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.
We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
The Imperials have really dug into Whiterun. We'll wrest it from them soon enough. We must. Its central position is key.
I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.
"Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing."
I'm glad we've finally restored the Pale. It was extremely foolish giving the Empire control of another port.
I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
"I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift."
"I'm glad we've taken back Winterhold. While the Imperials were up there, important resources were tied up stiffening our northern border."
I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.
Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
I'm glad we liberated the Rift. It was dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
Losing the Rift gives Tullius easy access to the south of Eastmarch. Talos preserve us. We must take it back!
I'm promoting you to Quaestor.
"Take this blade, a symbol of your new station and responsibility. I'll keep an eye on your progress. The Empire rewards excellence, and so do I."
Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars are won by talented and exceptional individuals.
"I'm raising you to Praefect. Take this blade, as a gift and symbol of your new rank. You've earned it."
You've come a long way. I don't think we could do without you. I'm hereby raising you to Tribune. Congratulations.
"Here, take this gift as a sign of the Empire's appreciation, and my own."
I have come to rely heavily upon you. It is only fitting that you join the upper echelon. I am hereby elevating you to the rank of Legate.
"On behalf of the Empire, and myself, please accept this gift along with your new rank."
Congratulations.
"However, I'm disappointed to hear that you fled from the field of battle. We do not reward cowardice in the Legion. I expect better of you."
"We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has seeped into your heart."
"Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy."
"Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you thus."
"The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it and to the people... but I've kept a little something to offer you in appreciation."
Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and sisters.
And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd like to offer you a home in Windhelm. Speak with my steward who'll make the arrangements.
Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer now.
"You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause."
"We do what we do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token of such love reciprocated."
You've become a true hero of Skyrim. I number you among my kin. You shall now be known as Stormblade.
"The love of the land and her people flows from your heart, even as death to her enemies flows from your hands."
"On behalf of the sons and daughters of Skyrim, on behalf of all that is righteous and true, take this token of our appreciation for your service."
But I'm disappointed to hear you ran away from the battle. The gods do not reward cowardice. Nor do I. I expect better from you.
We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the city. I thought you should be the one to have it.
We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the capital. I thought you should be the one to have it.
Found this among the dead. Something tells me I should give it to you.
Here. I want you to have this. Don't ask. Just take it.
I've come to rely on you. There's something I want you to have. It was my father's. It would be my honor if you carried it.
Something to report?
"The General and I have our disagreements, but he's the best hope for both the Empire and Skyrim."
Many of my countrymen joined the rebels. They can't see the big picture. Skyrim needs the Empire as much as it needs us.
Make it quick. I get enough delays from politicians.
I trust this is something important?
There isn't someone less busy who can help you?
The boss is going to cut those creepy cave people to pieces!
Yeah! It'll teach them to steal from us! One of them took my good helmet.
I hope one comes running up here so I can stab it right in the face.
I would be fine if they didn't.  Have you seen their eyes? They don't have any! Gross.
"La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la. La la la, la la la la la laaaaaahhhh..."

But... That doesn't mean there isn't more out there.
"Over the years I've heard things. Powerful magics lost to the ages, incredible spells that only the most skilled mages can master."
This is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.

A dragon?
What?
Now we're in for it.
Shut up.
"No, Housecarl!"
No!
We're with you!
Yeah!
We're so dead...
Yeah!
Let's move out.
Gotta have a sharp axe to cut through all that fat...
"Hurry up with it, we've got a merchant in the pit to take care of after we carve this thing up."
"If there's nothing else, I really must ask you to leave."
I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.
Anything you can find would be of great help. Good luck.
Keep your eyes to the road.
Thanks again for the ice wraith teeth.
Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.
Keep your belly full and your shoulders strong.
Come back when you're ready to spend more gold... goodness knows I could use it.
"Safe travels, landstrider."
"Good journey, marsh-friend."
Return anytime. You're quite welcome here.
"Remember, nothing but genuine fire salts will do... the forge knows the difference."
"If you need any more smithing work, come see me again."
Thanks for your business.
It was nice to meet you.
Be careful out there... Riften can be dangerous.
Door's over there. Why don't you use it?
Come back and see us again.
Just get out of here.
"If you'll excuse me, I have other things to attend to."
Imperial bastard.
"Farewell, kinsman."
Support Ulfric or die trying. There's nothing in between.
Talos preserve you.
Talos guide you.
Farewell.
It's been good talking to you.
"Good, now maybe I can get back to work."
"Well, that was important."
Come back and see us again!
Travel safe.
Remember to give at the temple.
Excuse me.
"When I find that bitch, I'm going to wring her little neck."
Visit me anytime. I'm not going anywhere soon.
I believe we're done.
Out of my way.
Don't forget to check your supply chest from time to time.
My experiments can't be completed until you've brought me those ingredients. Do hurry.
Now was it two parts giant lichen or three? Hm...
You'd do well to remember who's really in charge around here.
You'd do well to remember who's in charge around here.
May you return to Her Benevolence in safety.
You represent Mara now. Set an example for all.
"Good journey, my child!"
I don't know why I bother.
Try and get those marks without violence please. I don't want to be responsible for their deaths... or yours.
"Sure, leave. Not like you care anyway."
Remain vigilant and don't trust anyone.
"You've been kind, I thank you."
Any healing potion will do. Please hurry.
What am I going to do?
A Dreth never forgets a friend.
"Remember, keep this to yourself."
"Please, come back and speak to me anytime."
"Be cautious, the pilgrimage to the Shrine is not an easy one."
I'd ask you maintain civility while you're here.
Good journey to you.
You're welcome in Riften as long as you continue to obey our laws.
I'm keeping my eye on you.
"I have to remember... ward first, then summon."
"Okay, now where did I put those spiders?"
I see I still have much to learn. Lead on.
"Please be careful, I don't wish to be the reason for your death."
Just stay away from me and I'll forget we had this discussion.
Safe travels.
"Watch yourself around here, it isn't safe."
"Yes, yes... goodbye."
You didn't need to leave so soon.
Give Vex a kiss for me.
"Be careful, the road to Shor's Stone could be dangerous."
Don't forget us if you need supplies for your journey.
Honored guests.
Good people of Solitude.
Good friends and neighbors.
"I just wanted to take this time to thank you all for being here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with myself, and my new husband."
"Are you all enjoying yourselves? Please, eat, drink, and make merry on this most happy of days."
My husband Aesgir and I thank you for coming to our reception. We thank you for sharing the love we have for each other.
"Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves."
"These days, it seems there is dread everywhere, whether it be war or dragon. But I beg you - here, today, put such fears aside. Enjoy yourselves!"
"In this courtyard, there are no Stormcloaks. There are no Imperials. There are only people, come to celebrate a union of two souls. So make merry!"
I thank you all again for making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.
You have all helped make this a truly extraordinary wedding. All of my dreams have come true. So thank you. Thank you all.
May you all be as happy in your lives as I know I will be in mine. Thank you again for everything.
"I guess we should have expected this response, hmm?"
Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand when the chaos erupted.
I'll try and hold them off as best I can. You get back to the Sanctuary!
We'll meet back up at the Sanctuary! I'll be fine. Go!
Do not be afraid. Your Shout will not harm us.
"Shout at us, and let us taste of your Voice."
Strike us with the power of your Voice.
Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead.
"Damned good shooting, boys!"
Is it really dead?
We killed it! I can't believe it!
I thought we were all dead for sure!
Look at that!
Everybody get back!
What's happening?!
Dragonborn? What are you talking about?
That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn.
I never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.
"There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever."
But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. You must be one!
"No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here."
Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.
But I still hear the call of the blood.
We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.
"You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily."
Leave that to me.
"Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you."
"Hm. Yes, perhaps. A certain strength of spirit."
"Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?"
"Master, you're not truly considering accepting her?"
"I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts."
Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.
Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference.
What matters is their heart.
And their arm.
Oh you're back. Do you still think you could stand as a Companion?
"Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?"
"Of course. How are you in a battle, girl?"
That may be so. This is Vilkas. He will test your arm.
"Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our sake."
"Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle."
"That's the spirit. Vilkas, here, will get started on that."
Not here. Out in the yard. Come on.
"The old man said to have a look at you, so let's do this."
"Just have a few swings at me so I can see your form. Don't worry, I can take it."
Not bad. Next time won't be so easy.
Now that's impressive. You're mightier than you look.
"What do you think this is? We don't do battle with magic around here, new blood. Now come at me."
"Come on now, fight your own battles."
I'm guessing you're the newcomer then?
"Oh, don't worry too much about it. They were all whelps once. They just might not like to talk about it."
And don't always just do what you're told. Nobody rules anybody in the Companions.
"Not actually a Companion myself, but none of them know how to work a forge properly, and I'm honored to serve them."
My name is Eorlund Gray-Mane. I work the Skyforge. Best steel in all of Skyrim. All of Tamriel.
"That attitude would get you far, if you were some stuffy merchant or a Jarl's footstool."
"Around here, you'll want to learn to live your own life. Remember, nobody rules anybody in the Companions."
"Well, I'm not sure how they've managed it, but they have. No leaders since Ysgramor."
"Kodlak is the Harbinger, and he's a sort of advisor for the whole group, but every man is his own. Every woman, her own."
I have a favor to ask.
This isn't a command. Just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've got to get back to my work.
That's a good man.
Well done.
"Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Good to see you made it up here."
"Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Wait... I remember you. So the old man thinks you've got some heart, I guess."
"Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Are you new here?"
You know this one? I saw him training in the yard with Vilkas.
You know this one? I saw her training in the yard with Vilkas.
"I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned."
"Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing."
Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.
There you are. I had wondered where you got to.
Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?
"Ah, a man of action."
"Ah, a woman who lets her actions speak for her. I knew there was something I liked about you."
"Woah, ease up there. We're rough, but there's no need to kill a Shield-Brother over a dispute."
"I like your fire, though. You'll make a fierce Companion. Let us hunt together sometime."
"Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head."
Farkas!
Did you call me?
"Of course we did, icebrain."
Show this new blood where the rest of the whelps sleep.
"New blood? Oh, I remember you. Come on, follow me."
"New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me."
"Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they are good people."
They challenge us to be our best.
Nice to have a new face around. It gets boring here sometimes.
I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life.
The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're tired.
Tilma will keep the place clean. She always has.
"All right, so here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you."
Come to me or Aela if you're looking for work.
"Once you've made a bit of a name for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do."
Good luck. Welcome to the Companions.
You've already turned down a job that I had for you.
"Work needs doing, and if you're not up to it, maybe you're not cut out to be a Companion."
Be cautious. Beasts are not nearly as predictable as men. Give the thing a quick death.
"Good. I knew that we could count on you. It's simply a beast, but be cautious. The beasts of Skyrim are made of sterner stuff than most."
I knew we could count on you. Get it taken care of right away. Nobody wants an animal left roaming around in their place.
"You're not afraid, are you? Of animals? Come back when you find your spine."
"Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it."
"I see. Well, should you change your mind, the contract will be available for a while."
Looks like someone's been digging here. And recently.
Tread lightly.
Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to Jorrvaskr on my back.
Shor's bones... how did they find this place?
"I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true."
"Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast."
Some take to it more than others.
Of course you will.
"Fine, I'll get someone else to take care of it."
This work isn't for everyone. Maybe you're more cut out for those snowberries up in Winterhold.
"This isn't an order of cowards. I'll find someone more agreeable, I'm sure."
We've got to bring it down!
Don't let it get too close!
We've got to ground that bastard!
Come on! This is our best chance!
Attack while it's landed!
"Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch."
For the Blades!
Let's get this over with.
Come on. What are you waiting for?
"You're not afraid of me, are you?"
"Lorkhan's eyes, you're an ugly one, aren't you?"
Remember Cloud Ruler Temple!
Did you think the Blades had been destroyed?
"Now it's your turn, Thalmor bitch."
"The Blades will never be defeated, Thalmor dog."
I could use a hand here.
I'm not afraid of you.
For the Blades!
I wasn't looking for trouble.
I gave up this kind of thing a long time ago.
You can still run. It's not too late.
You've brought this on yourself.
Thalmor dog! Death is too good for you.
You'll die knowing it was the Blades that sent you to Oblivion.
You're starting to make me angry.
I'm in a bit of trouble here.
I need some help with this one!
You should not have meddled in the Thalmor's affairs.
The Thalmor's memory is long.
"Esbern cannot elude us, fool."
I shall sing of thee in Sovngarde!
Feel the bite of my axe!
It is glorious to battle once again in Tamriel!
Feel the thunder of my voice!
You will die for the glory of the Dragonborn!
You are not worthy of Sovngarde!
For the Dragonborn!
For Sovngarde!
My sword will taste of your blood!
Ah... the power of the dragon is yours! There can be no doubt that you are the Dragonborn of prophecy.
Alduin cannot ignore this for long.
"Ah! I've heard of this Shouting, but never seen it. Fascinating..."
"I've read the dragon language, but to hear it spoken is most interesting."
"This skill should prove very useful, Dragonborn. Fighting fire with fire, as the saying goes."
The dragons will surely fear your Voice.
I'll show you to your room. Right this way.
Let me know if there's anything else you need.
Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg.
By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.
There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.
"Such is our way! Such is the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!"
On this day... I go to Sovngarde.
Have you seen Astrid? She needs to speak with you. It seemed urgent. Come talk to me afterward.
Please. Not now. You'll know when I'm ready to discuss the issue.
Well now... would you look at that.
I never imagined we'd find something like this.
Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Hjaalmarch. Congratulations."
I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Pale. Congratulations."
I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Winterhold."
I grant you this weapon from the armory to serve as your badge of office.
"I'll also notify the guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Falkreath. Congratulations."
I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
"I do. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the Forsworn, back when that was possible."
They took his shield to those Hagraven beasts they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs.
"I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a Hagraven and lived. I'll understand if you decline."
You've honored my father's memory in more ways than I have words to say.
Divines watch over you.
I hereby grant you permission to purchase property in my city. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
And take this. A gift from the Jarl's personal stores.
"The last time I was in Whiterun, the tradesmen were talking about you. It seems your reputation as a businessman is growing."
Glad to hear all my hard work has paid off. Maybe we'll fetch a better price for our crops next time we're in the city.
"I picked up a set of fine silver brushes in the city, Reldith. I thought you might be interested."
How thoughtful! I'll come take a look after supper.
"Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?"
"Thanks for the offer, Jouane, but I'm saving up for a new sword."
"Good day, Lemkil. I saw some nice dresses for your little girls while I was in Whiterun. I'd be happy to purchase them, if you like."
"We don't need your charity, Breton. If my girls deserve something nice, it'll be their father who buys it."
"I hear your crops sold well at the market. Well done, Ennis."
"I'm trying something new, offering discounts for bulk purchases. So far, that seems to be working."
Are you making good progress with the planting?
"So far, things are going well. Let's just hope the weather holds."
"Ah, there's nothing like fresh air and honest labor to bolster the spirit."
"True enough, but there's nothing wrong with a little adventure now and then. Not much excitement in working the soil every day."
"Those little girls of yours are growing like weeds, Lemkil."
"Yes, and just like weeds, they're nothin' but trouble."
"Now that you mention it, there is."
"I have a buyer with, shall we say, a very odd taste in literature looking for some particular books."
I'm told they're the ravings of a madman... a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings.
"It's said to be spread across four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you."
Then we have a deal.
"In his later years, Andoril moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments."
"Yeah, but you're into gold. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm not going anywhere."
I can't believe it. You have them already?
"Here, take this. This should cover your end of the work nicely."
"It's a good start, but you need all four of the volumes or the set isn't complete."
Why don't you head back out to Yngvild and find the rest?
Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down.
The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform.
"After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again."
"Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar."
The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.
Good. I was hoping you hadn't forgotten about it.
"As promised, here's your payment for bringing them to me. Got it as part of a fair trade from my client."
Spare a coin for a fellow Nord who's down on his luck?
"So you can spend it on drinks at the Bannered Mare? If it's food you need, ask for that instead."
"Never you mind, then. I'll find a more charitable soul."
That's what I thought.
"Oh. No, no, no. Don't you understand? Guilt, innocence, right, wrong.... Irrelevant. What matters is I ordered you to kill someone, and you obeyed."
"Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important. When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No remorse."
"Hmph. When most would speak, you listen. You think. You understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders. To kill."
Good.
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Reach. Congratulations."
I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
"There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of."
"However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold, and who owns at least one piece of property in my city."
"You help my people and purchase a house from my steward, and I'll make you my Thane."
"There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of."
"However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold."
"You help my people, and I'll make you my Thane."
The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl. It's an honor to serve you.
"Long life to you, Thane."
I am your sword and your shield.
"Honor to you, my Thane."
"What do you need, my Thane?"
"Honored to see you again, my Thane."
No one in the Jarl's court is above the charge of conspiring against the city. You're coming with us.
No one in the Jarl's court is above the charge of conspiring against the city. You're coming with us.
"Oh, forgive me, Thane. I didn't realize it was you."
"We'll look the other way this time, but even the Jarl's influence has its limits. Be more careful."
Wait... I know you.
"In the name of the Jarl, I'm ordering you to stand fast!"
"Since you put it that way, I think we can overlook your crime for now."
"All right, all right. Just keep your voice down and don't let me catch you again."
Everything here appears to be in order. You can move along now.
I can make all your problems with the guards go away. But it'll cost you. What do you say?
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Haafingar. Congratulations."
I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. Congratulations."
I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
"I'd like to offer you a place in my court, as a Thane. It's mainly an honorary title, but there are a few perks."
"Now, by law and tradition, I can only grant the title to one who is known throughout Eastmarch, and who owns property in Windhelm."
"If you do good works for the people and purchase a home from my steward, I'll name you my Thane."
"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Eastmarch. Congratulations."
I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title.
"The Star is free to purify itself. Don't worry, mortal. I will return you before you are cleansed."
Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself.
I don't suppose you're going to buy something this time?
Are you daft? I told you not kill any of them. How much clearer do you need me to be?
How about the gold? Did you remember to bring it or is that too difficult an instruction as well.
"So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all you did it clean. I like that."
Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can be expensive.
I suppose it's not a total loss then.
Let me give you a piece of advice. If you want to make some serious coin in this business you need to listen to rules.
"Now, on to other things."
Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return.
"Here you go, I think you'll find these quite useful."
"Just browsin' today. If the gods be kind, someone will take mercy on me and spare a few septims."
"If they do, promise you'll actually purchase something for once."
"By Ysmir, I will. Gods know it's been too long since I tasted real meat."
I've got a recipe for venison stew that I want to try out. Will you have venison anytime soon?
Certainly. I'll be sure to bring some back for you the next time I go hunting.
"Make it quick, and there might be a bowl of hot stew in it for you."
"Ah, Olfina. How may I help you?"
"Got any sausages? I'm cooking a special breakfast for a friend, and they're his favorite."
"Would your good friend be named Jon, by any chance? I've spied the two of you talking quite intimately."
Glad to see you're making new friends. I know Jon's death was hard on you.
"Best you forget whatever you think you saw, elf. Such idle talk can prove hazardous to one's health."
"How goes the begging today, Brenuin?"
"That's right, mock the town beggar like everyone else. But I've got a right to browse, don't I? I ain't hurtin' anyone."
"Make it quick, then. I don't want your stink driving my customers away."
The gods smile on them who show charity. Best you remember that.
Those green apples you sold me the other day were delicious.
Aren't they? I always set some aside for myself when the traders bring them up from the south.
I'm sure you could charge double for those and still sell them all within a week.
You're right. I'll have to remember that the next time I get a shipment in.
"Did you raise your prices, Carlotta?"
I had to. The farmers are charging me double for the produce I sell.
"Let me guess, they're saying it's because of this trouble with the Stormcloaks?"
Exactly. Road patrols were cut in half because the Jarl needed soldiers. Now the bandits are bolder than ever.
"They've been raiding the farms for food, and supplies are scarcer than ever. Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead."
"Maybe, but they wouldn't taste as good as a loaf of fresh-baked pumpernickel."
"This is all just too much, too fast. Go get some work from Nazir. I need time to... to think..."
I envy you the chance to see this dragon up close!
No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!
Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!
I don't know!
"Kynareth save us, here he comes again..."
Where is it? I know you were trying to keep it for yourself J'zhar... You always try to keep it for yourself!
No! There's got to be more Skooma... Shut up! Shut up!  Don't lie to me J'zhar! You hid it! You always try to steal it from me!
No... No! You must be the one who took my skooma!
"Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason we are."
"Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to let him have it."
I realize some of you may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end your lives either.
"General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do."
Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence.
"Their spies must've found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us to have it. But they won't stand in our way."
I know some of you are ex-legion and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you.
Keep your wits about you and watch your shield brother's back.
"Ulfric Stormcloak is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do."
What? Get over with the rest of the men at Korvanjund.
Korvanjund. Remember?
Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.
That crown must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
My pa always warned me not to mess with places like this.
Careful. No telling what will happen the next time you mess with that door.
"Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to turn the rings so the door will open."
Keep a sharp eye out. There's no telling what we might run into in here.
"All for an old crown, huh?"
The Imperials will be sorry they got in our way.
"So far, so good."
"Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume."
That should do. Now - Inhale deeply.
"Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them."
"If anything actually happens, call a guard."
"If the guards in the Gray Quarter weren't a bunch of n'wahs, I wouldn't be here talking to you."
"My men have their orders. But it's a big city, and there's a war on. Plus these murders."
A few dark elves getting shoved around doesn't really amount to much.
Typical Nord. Beard for brains.
"Watch that tongue, Rendar, or your whole lot could be down with the Argonians hauling ballast by tomorrow."
"Well, nothing. At least not any more. Folk just call me that because of what I used to do."
"I was a sailor for many a year. I made my coin as a trader and in time, I bought my own ship."
"When I retired here in Windhelm, most folk already knew me as Captain Lonely-Gale, and the name just stuck."
"Terrible shame, that. Seems we have a killer on the loose here in Windhelm."
"He's claimed three victims that I know of, though maybe there's more that haven't been found yet."
"All lovely young ladies, too. Let's hope the guards find that demon soon, and introduce him to the headsman's axe."
There's an author named Adonato staying at the inn. He's published a few works of historical fiction.
The clans Shatter-Shield and Cruel-Sea see most of the gold that passes through the city.
"And obviously you have Ulfric, the Jarl and future High King."
"Oh, and that busybody Viola Giordano. She's got her nose in everyone's business, which I guess is one way of being prominent."
"If you're looking to pass the time, you can give Calixto a few septims and gawk at whater oddity he's come across lately."
"If you're need of goods, there's a market. If it's a soft bed and a hot meal you're after, there's Candlehearth Hall."
"Talos, who in life was known as Tiber Septim, united Tamriel and founded the Empire."
He was rewarded for his deeds by being joined with the Divines in eternal glory. The only mortal to do so.
"We worship him that we might follow in his path. We can't literally join him in the heavens, but we may do our best to know them here on Nirn."
The Empire's elven puppetmasters never cared much for the idea of a human becoming a divine. So the worship of Talos is outlawed.
"Skyrim doesn't take kindly to being told what to do. And to try and forget Talos, well... they may as well ordered us all to cut off our ears."
"Like anyone, a crisis will push them towards devotion. I've been seeing a lot of the Shatter-Shields, since they lost their daughter."
"Hillevi Cruel-Sea comes in a lot, but I haven't seen her husband here in years."
"Ulfric prays for strength. I speak to Captain Lonely-Gale, but he doesn't spend much time here. Too busy."
Where else would we be?
"When the Red Mountain burned, you could scarcely breathe in Morrowind. So we came west."
"Windhelm is the first city on that road, and here we are."
"If we had known the Nords would be so unwelcoming, we may have kept walking."
"Well you see where we have to live. This forgotten alley. All the filth from the upper quarters flows downhill, like they say."
Good luck getting one of the guards to help with anything.
"I tried to get Ulfric to even come down here to see the squalor, but the High Lord of His Mightiness couldn't find the time."
"I've got what I came for, I better get back to Dragon Bridge."
Did you find anything at Wolfskull Cave?
"None of that matters to me. Until someone takes a Dunmer, I let Windhelm deal with its own problems."
You are? Very good.... may I see it?
"Oh... what a terrible shame. Well, if you think you know where you left it and can retrieve it, I'll be here."
Excellent. Very good. This is exactly what I need to complete a series of studies I'm doing on Dwemer craftsmanship and magical resonance.
I simply must have this! I'll pay you double what it's worth.
Wonderful. You've just made an important contribution to the advancement of a Dwemer scholarship.
Well... I suppose important research is worth every coin. All right. You have yourself a deal. How's double and a half its value in trade?
With this the world could have a better understanding of the Dwemer!
"Come now, where's your sense of propriety? Extorting an old man like this."
"Hold on, there. I suppose, in the uh, interest of research... I can spare a few more coins. Double and a half its value. That's all I can muster."
Ha! I'll see to it the Jarl hears of your abuse of a court scholar. Shame on you.
Oh... well... I can see you have no appreciation for scholarship.
I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
Pick a man and put him down. We attack on my signal.
Time to show what you're really made of.
For Skyrim!
I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.
But there isn't any other way through.
"You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in there. We'll stay here and watch your back..."
"Not so sure? Oh, then perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh?"
"You there, Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting."
There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!
Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.
You have your orders. Get moving.
"No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut up or you'll blow our ambush."
I don't like it. What are they waiting for?
Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.
"Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead."
Don't give them a chance to warn the others!
Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than the Imperials could.
Now let's keep moving.
What in the nine holds is that?
Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?
Ah! The Hall of Stories... we must be getting close now.
One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings show a crown?
"Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got."
"Even if one of these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to have to find a way through that door."
"See what you can figure out, Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something."
Hmm... that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what it's used for.
Look out!
I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.
Is there anything on the claw that might show how to open this door?
Good job!
Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll find down here.
"Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got."
"Unblooded, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open."
"How's it going, Unblooded? You find anything yet?"
"Keep looking, Unblooded. There's got to be some way to get that thing open."
You see a lever anywhere?
"That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more..."
Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just the same.
"Let's hope that's the last of them. Come on, let's see what's down this way."
Oh... I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
"The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open."
We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find anything else useful.
"Yes, yes. We should proceed cautiously."
Namira grants us victory.
Praise to Namira!
The feast has begun!
I can smell the blood. Good and sour.
Good.
Is dinner ready?
I love this part of the meal.
I knew when you walked into the Hall of the Dead that you were special.
And here you are. Champion of Namira. Keeper of her ring. You're everything I hoped you would be.
That's the way I like it. Short and bloody. They never knew what hit them.
"We had the advantage of surprise this time, but things won't be so easy from here on out."
Enough talk. Let's go kill some Imperials.
"It's an honor, champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven."
"There, there. It will pass. Going too long without a proper meal can make the stomach weak."
"Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven, if you have the strength."
What's the situation?
"Stormcloaks were already camped out around the entrance when we got here. They don't know we're here yet, though."
"Well, that's something at least."
What's the situation?
"Imperials? Well, if they're keeping themselves comfortable, let's slip in and send them to their graves that way."
"Cold as the inside of an ice wraith. That and some Imperials are camped out around the entrance, staying nice and warm around their fires."


"Hail, Ilfhild."
"Hail, Galmar."
No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.
We're not leaving until we get what we came for.
Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though you start first.
"Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information I need."
We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride.[QUOTE]
The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover. It should be here somewhere.
"Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor."
"It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion."
I'll begin searching up here.
I'm relieved you discovered a bottle intact; this place looks as though it was ransacked by the orcs.
"So... I've taken us this far, but you need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink."
"Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people."
"I understand your hesitation, but I promise you that it works."
Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take precedence over our mission. My apologies.
"The inner sanctum lies ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles. Lead on, my friend."
"I call upon you, Lady Mara!"
The Skull hungers. It yearns for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake.
Grant me the power to break through this barrier and to send the Skull to the depths of Oblivion!
You there! Ah... citizen. This area is off limits.
"You are interfering in Imperial business. Yeah, so you'll have to pay us a fine... of say, 100 gold. Pay up, citizen."
"The, um, Emperor thanks you... Now shove off!"
"Er, rather, have a nice day, citizen."
"Fine. If you can't pay with coin, you'll pay with your life!"
If you insist. Come on boys. This'll be fun.
"Go on, get out of here!"
Get out of my face!
"It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the credit."
"Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it."
You found... how in the world...
"That's it. That's it! I don't know who you are, but you may have just saved this little project..."
"In fact, who are you, anyway?"
"I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful."
"You are, are you?"
"Savos wouldn't even grant us an audience when we came to you, but now you come here expecting something from me?"
"I don't much like this, I'll tell you. But you've saved my skin, so maybe I can overlook the past for now."
"Come on, I'll explain on the way."
Ha! So you did.
I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and gotten himself killed just to spite me.
"Well, with the Falmer skulking around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to come with me."
I'll explain on the way.
"No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is going to know that when I get back."
"I was the one who thought of using this... this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it. Something unpronounceable, I'm sure."
"From all our research, it seems they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine."
"This machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then... I'm not sure. Split it, somehow?"
It was my idea to replace one of the key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went into it.
Let's just hope they got it right this time.
I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer.
My knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a priest of Vaermina.
Faith? I don't have faith in anyone.
All I care about is cause and effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray area.
I hope not. This is an important job.
I have a competitor called Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business.
I also want to know how they managed to get the place up and running so quickly.
Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and look for Mallus Maccius. He'll fill you in on all the details.
The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's assurance you won't botch another assignment.
He claims you possess some sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find that hard to believe.
"I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished."
"If you plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming back."
Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.
"Oh, very well. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done."
"Well that's not how I operate, so forget it."
"Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness of your heart, would you?"
I hope you're not expecting to get paid until the job's done.
"Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions."
Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.
Yell all you want. It's not going to change my mind.
My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.
Saffir!
Wait... I....
"I know your family's honor is important to you, but we can't afford it!"
"It took me weeks to find that thieves' den. I can't stop now, and I can't get the sword on my own."
So you're willing to starve your wife and daughter to reclaim some rusty old sword?
"I just need to hire one, maybe two good men. You won't starve."
"I'll put it plainly. You can claim your sword, or you can keep your wife. If you set foot outside the gate, I won't be here when you return."

Goraan! I feel younger than I have in many an age.
"Many of the dovahhe are now scattered across Keizaal. Without Alduin's lordship, they may yet bow to the vahzen... rightness of my Thu'um."
"But willing or no, they will hear it! Fare thee well, Dovahkiin!"
Pruzah wundunne wah Wuth Gein. I wish the old one luck in his... quest.
But I doubt many will wish to exchange Alduin's lordship for the tyranny of Paarthurnax's [QUOTE]Way of the Voice[QUOTE].
"If Alduin himself could not stand against your Thu'um, I feel no shame in my own defeat."
You've returned. Good. What did you find at Wolfskull Cave?
I wish you well friend. Be careful.
Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.
"For the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs."
"A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves."
"Good. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to do this."
I can provide you with some help with her minions.
"As to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay."
Ah Potema. Former queen of Solitude and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history.
She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...
Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet.
Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.
Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet.
Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.
Excellent! These things do have a way of working out when people take action. I'll sanctify the remains.
In case Falk doesn't make it clear - Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
I hope Falk made it clear that Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
Been a while since I've seen one of those. What you've got there is a Stone of Barenziah.
Not like that it isn't.
The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.
I think there were twenty-four in all. Most people keep them as a curiosity.
"Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now."
"Look, I only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those stones unless they have the whole set."
"Tell you what, if you find the rest of them, talk to me again. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck."
"Unbelievable! You must be the first person to set eyes on all twenty-four of them in... well, the last two eras."
"When I told you the set had to be complete, I left out a small detail... I honestly didn't think you'd ever get this far."
"If the stones were remounted on the crown, it would be of great benefit to the Thieves Guild."
I have it on good authority that the crown is within Tolvald's Cave; dropped by a Dunmer caravan leaving Morrowind long ago.
"If you can bring it back, we could restore the paragon... and reap its benefits."
"I knew you had it in you. After all, finding the Stones was no easy feat."
"Well, I'm not one to welch on a deal, so here's your reward. I hope you put it to good use. I know I have."
Many used to come to these caves. The forgotten. The wretched.
I'll need to lock up the store. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us.
I should lock up the store now. Thank you again.
"Mara, I forgot how late it was. We'll need to lock up the shop."
"Mara, I forgot how late it was. Need to lock up the shop."
"Okay, well... I guess it's possible. I've been selling my sword arm for years now. Killed a lot of people. Could be someone wanted revenge."
But... But you're not going to kill me. Right?
I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't have the time or patience to be [QUOTE]nice.[QUOTE]
Do some people look down on me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right.
"He he he he he he he. The real question is, [QUOTE]Would someone pay to have me killed... again.[QUOTE]"
"A day goes by without someone trying to gut me in the street, I get disappointed."
"Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people. When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times... some times I got carried away?"
But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for that. Could they?
"I'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you have the gall to ask me that?"
"What do you think, genius?"
"Fool! Don't you get it? I live in the shadow of death every day. A knife in every doorway, a nocked arrow on every rooftop!"
"If one of my enemies wouldn't pay to have me killed, I'd take it as a personal insult."
Need a ride?
I can take you to any of the hold capitals.
My carriage is the safest way to travel.
Olfrid sent ahead his compliments. Looks like his friend Arn is soon to be released thanks to his brand new identity.
"More importanly, he's pledged the full support of the Battle-Born clan to the Thieves Guild."
Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons.
"Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again."
Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.
"At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm."
"Burnin' that banner was a nice touch, too. Should send a clear message to the Summerset Shadows that we're a force to be reckoned with."
Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.
"At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm."
"I wished you could have sent more of a message to those Summerset Shadows upstarts, but hopefully they'll stay out of our business."
I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back.
He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west.
"The Guild's at full strength and we have you to thank for it. We've had our share of dark times, and now they seem like a distant memory."
"I'm goin' to tell you'll somethin' you'll never hear me say again, and if you tell anyone I told you, I'll deny it."
"When you walk through the Guild, don't be ashamed to hold your head high 'cause you're the best damn thief in the place."
Success means that the Guild is gettin' stronger. We've picked up another merchant and a new recruit.
"Bein' a thief is like a second skin for you, ain't it? Never seen anythin' like it."
"If you don't watch out, you might even earn Vex's respect. Now that'd be something, eh?"
We're still growin' by leaps and bounds thanks to you. Another merchant's just moved into the space outside the Flagon.
You're a natural. Never seen anythin' like it.
"We've got a long way to go, but don't let that bother you... it's a lot farther than we've been in years."
I think you'll find that the Guild is beginnin' to grow. We've had a merchant move into the space right outside the Flagon.
It's nice to shake the cobwebs off and get things rollin' again. Keep this up and I can see a bounty headed our way.
"Well, I never thought I'd see the Guild this way ever again. The place is growin' into what it used to be when Gallus was runnin' the show."
Contacts are springin' up all over and I've got young footpads beatin' down the door to join up.
I got one last special request of you. Finish this one and all of Skyrim's ours for the takin'.
"I don't know what your made of, but I've never seen anyone tackle this many jobs without endin' up dead or in jail."
We've got half of Skyrim back under our wing and the coin's startin' to flow.
"Now, if you're ready, I got another special job for you."
I've got another special request and they specifically asked for you.
"Your makin' a name for yourself, that's for sure. But more important, you're makin' a name for the Guild. Keep it up."
"Well, it appears your actions are startin' to make waves out there. People are talkin' about the Guild again."
"In fact, I just got a special job request in. I haven't gotten anythin' like it in years."
Got word from Torsten Cruel-Sea in Windhelm that a rival Guild is tryin' to get itself started.
Not only that but they're givin' us thieves a bad name by murderin' their marks.
Get over there and see what you can do.
"We actually got a request from one of the most powerful families in Whiterun, the Battle-Born's."
"Make your way up there and look for Olfrid. He says he's got a matter that requires a delicate touch, and I suggested you for the job."
"Don't make me the fool and let me down, all right?"
I want you to head out to Markarth and speak to Endon. He's a silversmith... has some kind of a shop there.
"His father was a good friend of the Guild back in the day, and we could really use his family's influence back on our side."
I need you to make your way to Solitude and talk to Erikur. He's lookin' to run some kind of a shill job.
"Now, he's not exactly goin' to welcome you with open arms, but keep your cool. Do this job right and we've just made an important friend out there."
We will find her eventually.
She cannot hide from us forever.
"If you locate her, find us in Rorikstead."
"Quickly, come with me."
Find me the moment the Alik'r are taken care of.
And you're sure?
I've dispatched a rider to Helgen. We'll know soon enough.
"By Ysmir, this is just what we need. There'll be panic in the streets if this proves true."
"Panic we can handle, Balgruuf. It's the dragons I'm not so sure about."
Hmph.
Listen you impudent cur. According to my scrying something happened at Wolfskull Cave that returned Potema to this world.
"You weren't nearly as successful as you think, fool. According to my scrying the Wolf Queen has returned."
"I'm Sybille Stentor, court mage of Solitude, and according to my scrying you've managed to unleash Potema herself!"
What did you do in Wolfskull cave?!
I shall not be bound.
Something is wrong. There is an intruder.
You ants don't have the power to bind me!

Please get me home!
Are you here to save me?

"I don't know what the fight is about, and that's not our business anyway."
"I just need you to go out there, look tough, and scare this milk drinker into submission."
"No more than that. I don't want to hear about a killing, understand?"
"Shor's bones, boy. What did I tell you?"
"Shor's bones, girl. What did I tell you?"
I'm cutting your pay for this job.
Be more careful next time. This isn't a game.
"Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, brother."
"Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, sister."
You seem to have a knack for this kind of thing. I'll make sure people in charge know.
I figured you had it in you. Nicely done.
Perfect. Hopefully this will let us know more about their movement. I think we've got them on the run!
"Excellent. Looks like you've really driven them into hiding. Keep this up. We'll wipe them out, yet."
"Not much further. Come, little thing. Serve me in death."
"I'm not the only one seeing this, am I?"
"Why, this is utterly unique."
"Token, you say? Let me see."
"Oh, goodness me. You're a friend of Gabriella's, then. Well, I guess we both know why you're here."
"Hmph. Yes. Yes, I surely can. It's not something I do lightly, mind you, and it's not as specific as you might want. But yes. I will do this for you."
"Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it..."
"There's a cave. No, not a cave. A... home? A place you feel secure. You will find safety there... sanctuary. I see snow, lit by the star of dawn."
"And you are not alone. There are others. A child of night... a stalker of the sands? Oh, but before you are family, there will be blood. Such blood."
"Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest..."
"Through there is... Hag's End. The last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you."
"Your destiny is dark. Oh yes, so dark. But much of it has been fulfilled. You have found sanctuary, and the comforting words of a mother's love."
"And you have companionship. A child of night, and a stalker of the sands. Together, you are a family."
"Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest..."
"It is the last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you."
"No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden."
"Oh, very well. But my energies are low. I warn you - I won't be able to see much. Give me... five gold, and I'll do what I can."
"Sorry, love, but I'm not a charity."
Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.
Sure thing. It's yours for a day.
"What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed."
Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.
Have a good rest. It's the big room with the double bed.
Sure thing. It's yours for a day.
"What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed."
A Forsworn agent. Running loose in the city. The Jarl is going to hear about this.
The Jarl has things under control. Don't you worry.
This was their city once. They won't stop until we're all dead.
Now you're being ridiculous. This is our city. Not theirs.
Someone was attacked in the market. Do you know who it was?
"I think it was Margret. Poor woman, she was just visiting the city from Cyrodiil."
"Yeah, but she was a Nord. And a noble. Perfect Forsworn target."
You're being paranoid. We're in control of Markarth. Not the Forsworn.
The Jarl is refusing to dispatch men to the front lines. Do you think it's because of the Forsworn threat?
Please. Those savages are no match for us. The Jarl is just biding his time.
Biding his time until what? Until another person is lying dead in the streets? Don't be naive.
The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
The Forsworn. Here inside the city.
He was after Margret. Why?
Damn. Another body to get rid of.
Betrid. No! We had a deal you Forsworn bastards!
Why? We had a deal Madanach. A deal!
Traitors. Traitors all of you!
We'll handle things from here. Move along.
I said move along. The Forsworn are just a bunch of madmen. We have everything under control. Stay out of it.
That's right. It isn't.
Margret. He... he killed her. Right in front of me.
He... he tried to kill Margret. Right in front of me.
"She's a traveler, from the Imperial City. Came by every day looking for jewelry for her relatives back home."
Why would anyone want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense.
No. She's such a nice woman. Comes by every day looking for jewelry for her family in Cyrodiil. Is it because she's a noble?
Why would anyone want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense.
I'm sorry. I don't think I can bare to sell anything right now.
Did you see that madman? A Forsworn agent. Here in the city.
Think he worked down at the smelter. Lot of the laborers there are sympathetic to the Forsworn.
They promise people they'll kill off all the Nords that rule over the Reach. Nothing but murderers and saboteurs.
Didn't you just see that woman getting attacked in front of us? We're closed.
"So, it is done. Alduin dilon. The Eldest is no more, he who came before all others, and has always been."
"Happy? No, I am not happy. Zeymahi lost ont du'ul Bormahu. Alduin was once the crown of our father Akatosh's creation."
Of course. Alduin wahlaan daanii. I would not have helped you if I thought otherwise.
You did what was necessary. Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok - the arrogance of his power.
Indeed.  Alduin wahlaan daanii.
His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu - our father Akatosh.
But I cannot celebrate his fall. Zu'u tiiraaz ahst ok mah. He was my brother once. This world will never be the same.
"And so you fulfilled your destiny, which you once said you did not believe in."
You once told me you did not believe in destiny.
"Indeed, you saw more clearly than I - certainly more clearly than Alduin. Rok funta koraav."
Perhaps now you have some insight into the forces that shape the vennesetiid... the currents of Time.
Perhaps you begin to see the world as a dovah.
But I forget myself. Krosis. So los mid fahdon. Melancholy is an easy trap for a dovah to fall into.
You have won a mighty victory. Sahrot krongrah - one that will echo through all the ages of this world for those who have eyes to see.
"Savor your triumph, Dovahkiin. This is not the last of what you will write upon the currents of Time."
Perhaps. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
"And, as you told me once, the next world will have to take care of itself. Ful nii los. Even I cannot see past Time's ending."
I am glad you believe that. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
Even I cannot see past Time's ending to what comes next. Niid koraav zeim dinoksetiid. We must do the best we can with this world.
"Zu'u Odahviing. Call me when you have need, and I will come if I can."
"As for myself, you've proven your mastery twice over. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly acknowledge the power of your Thu'um."
"And so Alduin's lordship passes to you. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly submit to your mastery of the Thu'um."
"Oh yes, Cicero and the Listener! On the hunt!"
Off we go.
"Oh, but the Listener jests with poor Cicero. You already have company. You don't need my help at all."
I am honored to be chosen.
"Lead on, Listener."
But you already have a traveling companion. I fear I would just get in the way.
"I am yours, Listener."
"Yes, Listener."
"Oh, well... You seem to already have assistance. Surely you mean to remain inconspicuous..."
"Yes, Listener! I will remain in this very spot until you tell me otherwise. Spiders could eat my face off and faithful Cicero would not move an inch!"
"Yes, Listener. I won't move unless you give the word."
I'll remain in this location until ordered otherwise.
"Home again, home again! I'll return to the Night Mother straightaway!"
"Oh, of course. Mother needs me, after all."
"I will return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary immediately, Listener."
"Yes, Listener. I'll be here if you need me."
"Yes, Listener. I'll return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary without delay."
"Of course. But if you need me, just give the order."
Listener!
"You were told to find it, weren't you?"
"If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic."
Savos. Before... before he died.
He... He gave me something just a little while ago.
"He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came."
"I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him."
"Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now."
"Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us."
I said let's go. Now.
Arkay watch over you.
"Yes. I'm your friend, and I've invited you to dinner."
I've been invited to dinner.... I'm so hungry....
"Why don't you lay down and rest, while we get the meal ready?"
I need to lay down. I'll just be a minute....
Come with me. Our feast is about to begin.
The meal is on Namira's table. Go ahead. Carve.

"Nothing refreshes the soul like an honest day's labor in good, tilled earth."
Looks like it's going to be a bountiful harvest once again. The gods continue to smile upon us.
It's remarkable that our farms are so prosperous given the harsh winters of late.
Looks like we're in for quite a harvest. We've had better luck with our planting than any village in the hold.
Luck? I think it has more to do with the hard work and good soil.
"Maybe you're right. Even so, I can't help wondering if some other force it at work here."
The last wheat shipment fetched a fine price at market.
"Well done! I don't know where I'd be without you, my old friend."
It pleases me to know that I can still be of use even in the twilight of my life.
Look at you! You're as filthy as a pig in a pen!
I am not! You're lying!
"You smell like a pig's pen, too. What a stink! Have you been rolling in the dirt all day?"
You're a liar! I won't listen to you. Leave me alone!
"Father, how old were you when you left home?"
"I know where this is going, son. As I've said many a time. the world is a dangerous place. You're much safer here at the farm, with me."
But I don't want to be safe! I'm not afraid of the dangers out there. The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting my life on this farm.
"Yes, that's your mother's side of the family talking. Just stay on for one more season, that's all I ask."
"I heard you sneaking around downstairs last night. Were you trying to break into my chest again, son? I've told you to leave it alone."
"I just wanted to try on your old armor, from back when you were a soldier. I thought I might be old enough to wear it."
"I've told you a hundred times, I lock that chest for a reason. I don't want you getting a head full of ideas about adventure and glory."
"I'm old enough to decide how to live my life, and I'd be honored to wear your armor, if you'd just let me. I'm strong enough to handle it."
Another fine day at work in the fields. I don't envy those city folk who miss out on the joys of working the land.
I'll tell you who I don't envy - those poor children who lost their parents in this war.
"Lives lost, crops burned, land ruined... there's no greater sin than war. And yet, you were an orphan, and you've made something of your life."
"I was lucky. If you hadn't rescued me, I'd probably be a thief, a mercenary or something even worse."
It's too fine a day to dwell on such things. Let's get back to work and forget about wars and orphans for awhile.
"The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the hold."
Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit.
Hah! Who in their right mind would pay for dirt? You'd get laughed out of Whiterun for even trying it.
"Hey, people have paid money for stranger things. Take our cow dung - we sell that by the wagon load."
"When you're rich, you can waste as much money as you like on far-fetched business ideas. In the meantime, there's a farm to run."
"I'm not saying it's my business, but I have to ask. Why are you so cruel to your little girls?"
"You're right, it's none of your business. How about you keep your nose out of it?"
"You keep on like you are, you'll end up with two daughters who hate you."
Hah! And what would a witless oaf like you know about raising children?
"Your daughters are growing up fast, Lemkil. Seems like only yesterday they were newborn babes."
"They've grown, all right - lazier and more stupid."
There's times I think you're the coldest man in Skyrim. This is your own flesh and blood you're talking about.
"Today I'll teach you a useful spell that might just save your life. If you should ever fall into a river, you'll be very glad you learned it."
Oh! Are you going to teach me how to turn into a mud crab?
"Oh, it's much better than that. I will teach you how to breathe underwater, with no need to turn into one of those ugly creatures."
Wow! Then I could dive into a river and swim so far away that Britte and father could never find me.
"Now, clear your mind and breathe deeply. Good concentration is very important for spellcasting."
Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively before dying. My duty in life and in death is to make sure he stays in this tomb for eternity.
He had a way of enthralling people and built up a loyal army of followers. Good men fell under his spell and were forever twisted. Made... evil.
"After that, fear was enough to keep them in line. He could torture and humiliate them and they would not rebel. Even in death, they serve him still."
"Good. Here you are. He'll follow you to Oblivion and back, if it comes to that."
Sorry. You already have an animal with you.
"War dogs cost gold, friend. Come back when you have some."
"What is it, woman? Sven drunk on the job again?"
Hod. Just come here.
"Hush, Frodnar. This is no time for your games."
"Aw, mama, I want to stay and talk with Uncle Ralof!"
"That's right! Don't worry, Uncle Ralof, I won't let those soldiers sneak up on you."
I'm glad to assist you in any way I can.
But I need your help. We need your help.
Don't worry about me. I know how to lay low.
Helgen? Has something happened...?
How quickly you've advanced. Most impressive.
"There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will."
But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora.
You dare bring me here? You must be punished.

Now you're one of us.
Which means you get to tag along on a little trip with me.
"Oh, and here. You're a Stormcloak now, you ought to look the part."
"I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic."
I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares.
"I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike."
The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals. It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep.
"Because the rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed to slow down the aging process."
"Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the more the mind can become damaged."
Those who've been under the effect of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their minds entirely.
"In some cases, a few never awoke at all."

"Speak to Beirand, he's normally out by the forge. He'll get you outfitted."
"Now, if I'm not mistaken. Legate Rikke has a special assignment for you."
We're not done here.
It's all right. I will not shun you for what you are. Stay. I will tell you everything you have forgotten.
A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore.
"Namira, the Lady of Decay, accepts you for what you are. She has a place for us, where we can sate our appetites without judgment."
To Oblivion with you then!
"A priest, filled with the taste of an easy life. Brother Verulus, from Markarth."
Give him this gold. Tell him you need Arkay's help exploring an old cavern for treasure.
"And when he stands in Namira's presence, she will take care of the rest."
Draugr are below. Foul tasting.
The shrine of Namira is further inside. Keep going.
The shrine of Namira is beyond that door. Get ready.
"Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal."
"Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares."
In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara.
"Occasionally. But an Orc blade is a very personal thing. Anger, regret, pride. All these things are put into our steel."
"When my daughter Lash chose to leave the stronghold, I forged a sword to channel all my shame and grief."
"Honor me with a task, outlander. Bring the sword to my daughter, if you see her. It'll be all she needs to know."
"So that's it, then. [QUOTE]Don't come back.[QUOTE]"
Thank you. Here. You honored my mother's task and should be rewarded.
"Now, I need to be alone."
"Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can."
But I need your help. We need your help.
So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?
"That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks."
What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!
Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.
Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling?
"I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!"
You. Over here!
That's it. Keep hacking at it.
It's coming loose. I can feel it.
"You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?"
No. Not again. Help!
"Wait, come back!"
Where are you going? Come back!
Noooo!
Aaaaagh!
"Cut me down, or you'll never get the claw!"
Where are you... get me down from this!
"Sorry, but I have a treasure to get to..."
So long [QUOTE]friend.[QUOTE] Ha ha ha!
You're not getting that treasure.
I'm too swift for you!
Too slow!
Get me out of here!
"Hey, over here!"
"Don't leave me, for Arkay's sake!"
Help me! Help!
Help me out of here!
Get me down. Get me down!
"Ah, kill it. Kill it!"
Get it away from me. Get it away!
Don't let it get me. Help!
Agh. Agh!
Keep it away from me!
Is it over?
Is it dead?
Is it safe now?
You'll never get the claw!
Too slow!
You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.
"What? Who are you? Oh, never mind. Cut me down before that thing gets us!"
"Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!"
"Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there."
"Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first."
"Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you."
It's been forever since I've eaten so well.
"And it shows, I've seen horkers with smaller guts."
Funny coming from a woman who's breath smells like she just kissed a draugr.
Would you two shut up before Brurid hears you messing around.
Stay away from Camilla.
"Ah, Camilla. Fair as the morning sun. But I ask you, how could she prefer your brooding to my romantic tunes?"
"Just stay away from her, or...or else."
You play so well.
"With you as my muse, how could I not?"
"Oh, Sven. You do know how to turn a girl's head."
Gimme a mug of ale.
A pint of your finest mead.
"Some wine, please?"
I'll have some mead.
Pour me an ale.
Coming right up.
Certainly.
You need to choose between those two boys. It ain't fair to Sven or Faendal to keep tuggin' on their heart strings like that.
It's bad enough my brother is harping on me to pick one. Don't you start too.
I'm just sayin' you should pick one to settle down with.
I got a new order in for shields. I'm gonna need some hardwood planks. None of that soft pine this time.
"Ay, we can get that for ya. We just finished the timber for those catapults."
"War may be good for business, but it's hard on families."
"A hard truth, that is. Let's drink to the fallen ones."
"Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to see another Guild brother down here."
They grabbed me in the Ratway. The nerve of these bastards... they need to be taught a lesson.
They grabbed me in Riften. They seem to think I know something. They just kept asking me the same damn questions.
"Oh, yes? I wonder what that old busybody wants now."
"Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation."
"And I'm sure he told you it was urgent. Well, he's not the only Jarl in Skyrim with problems to deal with."
"Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation."
"So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years."
You'd better come in and tell me how you found me and what you want.
"Delphine? How do you ... ? This is just a trick to get me to open the door, eh? I told you to go away!"
I hear your heart beat like the Harbingers of old. Your glories in Skyrim are seen and honored.
"In life we were enemies, but eternity's too long to hold a grudge - my heart's now free of such old hatreds."
"Hero of the Nords I name you, Dragonborn, let none deny it."
The mist is gone! A glorious day!
The World-Eater is dead! The way is now clear!
You saved us all. We will sing of you forever.
"Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here."
The three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
"Do not fail Kodlak. He's earned his place here, and does not deserve to fall prey to Alduin's insatiable hunger."
"My disciples still follow the difficult path - the Way of the Voice is neither wide, nor easy."
But if you stray from wisdom then to Sovngarde you will not return.
"You freed Svaknir, a fool of a poet, but an honest enemy who has earned my respect."
"Sadly, he's now lost in the soul-snaring mist - defeat Alduin, and his doom avert - I hope to greet him in this Hall as a friend."
"Fate drives you, but you follow your own path. Choose wisely, lest you wander into evil."
"Far you've travelled, your trials long, to taste of Sovngarde's sweet delights."
"Seek ye food or song unending? Fighting, drinking, fellowship and boasting? Find welcome here, and warm your soul."
"Hail, Dragonborn. That honor is also mine - to our shared birthright you'll bring new glory!"
Dragonborn! Have you come to cleanse Sovngarde at long last of Alduin's foul mist?
"Why does Shor forbid us to face Alduin? I fear no worm, World-Eater though he be."
"I long to fight that foul worm, but by Shor's command we curb our wrath."
"No gloom can hold my heart for long in Shor's bless'd hall, where no shadows lie."
"A cup, Dragonborn, to death and glory!"
"Take your ease, let troubles fade."
"By Shor's command we curb our wrath, so we feast and sing, til the final doom."
"Shor's power protects this hall; but beyond is fear, brought by Alduin."
Shor's high seat stands empty; his mien is too bright for mortal eyes.
"Banners, huh? Trying to pretty up the place? All right, you got it."
"That'll come in handy, yeah? An alchemy station, maybe a little garden with some choice plants. All right, consider it done."
"Oh ho. Now that's the Dark Brotherhood I know and love. This for business or pleasure? Ah, what's it matter, right? I'll see that it gets done."
"Yeah, we can do that. I'm thinking a sewer grate on the outskirts of Dawnstar. Leads to a tunnel, then inside. You'll be in or out, quick as a coney."
"Heh. Chamber fit for a king and all that, right? No problem. Give ya a big bed, decorate the room real nice, maybe even throw in a few extra baubles."
Suit yourself.
"You're a little light on coin there, my friend. No gold, no refit."
"Now, might I offer some advice? You should go to Riften and find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before?"
"Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, hmm?"
"You do that, and I'll see what I can do about recruiting some new additions to our Family..."
"You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council?  Let's see!"
"Don't applaud yourself too soon, worm!"
Rip the eyes from her head!
Rip the eyes from his head!
The Forsworn have taken Kolskeggr Mine. We're the only ones left.
"Troll's blood, what happened to you Pavo?"
Gods.... You two head inside and get some rest. I'll send word to the Jarl.
"The question is, what isn't wrong with Riften."
This city is corrupt. Rotten to the core. No one cares about anything except themselves and how much coin they can make off the misery of others.
Authorities? Have you been listening to what I said? They're all dirty. Every one of them.
The only way to get things done in this city is to keep your head down and pay off the right people.
"Of course. Nothing gets done without my approval in this city. I have the Jarl's ear, and the guards in my pocket."
Anyone makes trouble for me and I pay a visit to the Thieves Guild. Make me angry and I contact the Dark Brotherhood.
You'd do well to remember that the next time you make such a stupid observation.
The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit.
I dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does to its own people.
And you think that I care? Interesting.
I don't believe in getting my hands dirty. You have people that handle those sort of things... use them.
"Mara's domain encompasses the emotions we strive the most to embrace; love, compassion and understanding."
"It's difficult to appreciate her gifts in these dark times, but you should consider her light a beacon in the storm."
This heap of matchsticks is what everyone calls Haelga's Bunkhouse. Can you stay here? No.
"The Bunkhouse is for the working man, not some sort of a luxury inn for tourists."
Of course not. You expect me to take care of it by myself?
My niece Svana helps me with the chores. She'd be more help if she kept her head out of the clouds.
She's been with me ever since her parents were killed by bandits and she was dropped in my lap.
"Well, I'd better get back to work. You two make yourselves at home."
"Well, I'd better get some sleep. Don't mind me, though. You two make yourselves at home."
This is it men!
This is it men! It's time to make this city ours!
"They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the Imperials behind them!"
"They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the rebels behind them!"
They'll have set barricades to slow us down.
"Destroy them quickly, and take out the archers in the towers along the way."
"They'll have barricades set, destroy them quickly. Keep pressing forward."
"Our objective is the drawbridge. If we can find a way to drop it, the city will be ours!"
"The faster we take them out, the faster we can claim this city as ours!"
Beyond that are two exterior gates. Find a way to open them and we can take this city!
All that remains then is the exterior gate. Find a way through to open it and the city will be ours!
"Whiterun's walls are tall, but they are old and crumbling, like the Empire whose Legion lines them."
"The approach to Riften is guarded by watchtowers. They will be full of archers. Move fast, and stay low."
"The only way into Windhelm is across this bridge. Keep moving, stay close, and we'll be through their gates in no time."
We now fight our way to Castle Dour to cut the head off the legion itself!
"And in that moment, the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free!"
"The walls of Markarth may be high, but their age will have created weakness or secret entrances. Find them!"
Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperial milk drinkers what true Nords look like!
Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperials what we're made of!
Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
"Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!"
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
All right men. On me! For the Emperor! For his Legionnaires!
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
"Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the sons and daughters of Skyrim!"
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
Our ancient debt for Alduin's reprieve is now repaid - the long night is ended!
"I'll look for you, friend, when at last you return to Shor's hall. The honor will be ours when you rejoin the ranks of Sovngarde."
"Even here, where heroes throng, few can match this mighty deed. What glory! The gods themselves must envy us this well-earned honor!"
Dammit...
I think this might be the end...
"Aye, you've got a point there."
Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.
"Your guy's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens and paying us good coin for nobody to know about it. Well, until now that is."
"Tell you what. Go ahead and deal with your business for now. When you're done, find me and we'll deal with mine."
You have been a worthy tool. Fill the world with destruction in my name.
"Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself."
"Spare me your pitiful pride. You are but a tool of my ambitions, mortal. Never forget that."
"Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself."
"I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could use it?"
Just coat your weapon with it. Then... you get the idea.
You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness.
But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their purpose.
"Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will crush you."
Only Dagon can declare if a pawn is worth keeping. I. Have. Spoken.
"I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to wreak havoc on Tamriel."
"They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of Destruction and Change."
"The Mythic Dawn killed Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, triggering the events that lead to the Oblivion Crisis, when the Daedra invaded Tamriel."
"All that remains of the infamous cult, I've gathered in my museum."
You'd better get out of that Stormcloak gear. Today's not the day to go around dressed like a rebel.
What's happened? He's not...
Is he dead?
"Everyone please, stand back!"
Please remain calm!
"Arniel, stay on your guard. We can't let harm come to these people."
"Gods, I'll be glad to see the last of Skyrim."
"Dragons, murder, rebellion... and we sail right into the middle of it with the Emperor on board."
I think we'll all feel better once we're back out to sea. Won't be long now.
"Well, it's all over now. Lieutenant said you could see the smoke from Whiterun."
Yeah. I'm glad we can finally stand down- getting tired of looking over my shoulder all the time.
I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely.
Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts.
I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way.
Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content.
"I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent.
"The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife."
This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance.
"If you ever feel the need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and step onto a different circle."
"Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day."
"Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it."
The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in my life has finally been filled.
"I only hope that this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning."
"Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known."
There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking.
"We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do."
"A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn."
"One of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever."
"That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim."
"At least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous marauders. And the third owner, Jorgen, I only know he lives in Morthal."
Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked.
"Don't know what you're talking about, stranger."
Look at them. The legendary sharpness of a deadric weapon. Marvelous.
And here's your payment for the shards.
Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the Daedra. Look at how it shines.
"Here's your gold, as promised."
Did you try the grip? Isn't it eerie how it seems to mold itself into your hand?
Here's your gold.
"Finally, all the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor are in my hands. It's time I let you in on something."
There's a fourth piece. That scabbard in the display case. Built to house the Razor. And there's more.
I know how to put all the pieces together. We just need to take them to Dagon's shrine and contact the Lord of Change directly.
"We just need the shards of the blade and the hilt, now."
"We just need the pommel and the shards of the blade, now."
"We just need the hilt and the pommel, now."
"There's only the shards of the blade left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?"
"There's only the pommel left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?"
"There's only the hilt left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?"
And here you are. I hope you've found the museum to your liking.
"But our work is just beginning. Approach me, Listener, and hear my words."
Yet another child has prayed to their mother.
"Speak with the Nervous Patron at Candlehearth Hall, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
"Speak with the Wary Outlaw at the Bee and Barb, in Riften. Accept his gold, and then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
"Speak with the Corrupt Agent at the Penitus Oculatus Outpost, in Dragon Bridge. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!"
"Speak with the Scheming Servant at the Keep in Markarth. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
"Speak with the Desperate Gambler at the Barracks, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
"Speak with the Blasphemous Priest at the Temple of Kynareth, in Whiterun. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!"
"Speak with the Dishonored Skald at the Bards College, in Solitude. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
"Speak with the Indolent Farmer at the Vilemyr Inn, in Ivarstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
"Speak with the Griefstricken Chef, at the Windpeak Inn, here in Dawnstar. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. Hail the Listener! Hail Sithis!"
"Speak with the Unemployed Laborer at the Frostfruit Inn, in Rorikstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal - just speak the word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm wherever he lurks.
"Hold, comrades - let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined."
Feel free to look around. Come talk to me when you're ready to discuss that job I mentioned.
"Those robes were worn during the Mythic Dawn's secret meetings, where they plotted to bring the Daedra Mehrunes Dagon into Tamriel."
Each bolt of yarn used to make the robe was colored with a dye made from sacrificial blood.
"The Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes were written by the Mythic Dawn cult leader, Mankar Camoran."
"He promised a paradise awaited his followers when they died, that they would be reborn by Mehrunes Dagon's side."
The tapestries hung here and outside were found in hideouts where members of the Mythic Dawn would meet and plot.
The cult's greatest accomplishment was the assassination of the Septim Dynasty and the opening of the Oblivion Gates.
That burned paper is all that remains of the fabled Mysterium Xarxes. The blasphemous book written by Mehrunes Dagon himself.
It's said that Mankar Camoran used the book to open a portal to a Paradise where all his followers would live forever.
"Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done."
My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
"You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices."
My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
"Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own... don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise."
"But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade."
Think about the Guild... about the state it was in when you began. Think about all the little things you might have heard.
"A pick breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky clearing at the wrong moment..."
Our access to those bits of luck are what separates us from common bandits.
Precisely. There are a few who still call Nocturnal [QUOTE]Lady Luck[QUOTE] and for good reason.
You've arrived at last. The hero who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
You've arrived at last. The heroine who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
"I have much to thank you for, little one. When you die I will raise you and you can take your place by my side."
You'll serve me soon enough.
"I don't recognize you, but I sense that you're one of us. Who are you?"
"The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity."
"We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for what's happened here."
I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship.
"Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key."
I haven't heard that name in a long time.
How do you know of me?
"Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible."
"From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself... well... dying."
The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within these walls is the Ebonmere... a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam.
"When Mercer stole the Key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our ties to her."
"I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll."
Whatever damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.
"With the Ebonmere closed, and their sudden severance from the realm of Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change."
They're shadows of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or their original identities.
"My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed."
"However, ever since that day, I've felt my power waning... slowly draining away."
"Ha! You can't resist, can you?"
"Let's see... this one, I think. J'zargo has designed it to be an excellent flame cloak, with a twist."
"It is especially potent against the undead, and should burn them to a crisp in no time."
"J'zargo gives you plenty of these scrolls, so you try them and return when you can say whether they work."
"I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!"
"Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. Dragon Bridge is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense."
Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule.
"J'zargo has worked hard on learning new spells, trying new things. This will make J'zargo stand out as a mage."
"But J'zargo works so hard, there is no time to test these new spells. If you help with the testing, this will make learning easier."
"J'zargo will give you scrolls, you will use them and report the results. This is a good plan, no?"
You tell J'zargo when you are ready.













What the... we've been betrayed! Look out!
There he is! Get him!
Treachery! Attack!
Let's finish this.
"I dunno, Drahff. They'd skin us alive if they knew we were doin' this."
Why are you always acting like such a big baby? I've gotten us this far.
This far? We're livin' in a sewer. You said we'd have a house as big as the Black-Briars' by now.
"You worry about bashing people's heads in, I'll worry about the Guild. Okay?"
"Okay, okay."
I'm going to check the entrance to the Ratway. Be right back.
"Hey, you. Stop right there!"
Empty your pockets or end up as skeever food.
Brynjolf's been sending idiots like you down here for years looking for their hideout.
Funny thing is his stupid Thieves Guild never counted on me and my partner blocking the way.
"Now, empty your pockets or I'll pick the gold off your corpse."
No need to get hasty. I... I was just testing you. You can go on ahead.
"Let 'em go, Hewnon. All clear."
I doubt that very much.
You aren't going to pass. You're going to give me everything you have. Whether you leave here in one piece is up to you.
Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!
"Ignoring me, huh? Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!"
"Don't worry, Hewnon will let you pass."
We won't give you any more trouble.
Sorry to have bothered you. I'll just be out of your way now.
What are you lookin' at?
J'zargo is eager to hear how the scrolls are working.
"It is difficult to admit, but J'zargo could still use some help."
Can you... can you possibly help J'zargo?
J'zargo has seen that Tolfdir likes you.
"You must be very skilled with magic, yes?"
"J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. Can you help with this?"
This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals. You should be cautious.
For Kodlak!
"Greetings, Shield-Brother."
"Greetings, Shield-Sister."
No. I will have no peace until these hunters are dead.
"Can it be? You've brought me my amulet? Oh, thank Arkay. And thank you. Oh, dear friend, please, take this gold for your troubles."
"Has the Bloodmoon called you, fellow Hunter?"
The prey is strong. Stronger than the hunters.
"But more will come. Bring him down, for the glories of Lord Hircine."
A dragon! I saw a dragon!
"What? What is it now, mother?"
"It was as big as the mountain, and black as night. It flew right over the barrow."
"Dragons, now, is it? Please, mother. If you keep on like this everyone in town will think you're crazy."
My favorite drinking buddy! Let's get some mead.
"Not now. If I don't pull night duty, I'll drink a round with you at the Sleeping Giant."
But I'm thirsty now.
You're always thirsty. Just like you're always drunk. Now let me get back to my rounds.
Has my son Sven asked to join the war?
Not this again.
"If he does, tell him how bad the food is. And how dangerous it is."
"Look old woman. If your boy wants to learn how to fight, we'll teach him. Now off with you."
Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...
"It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of."
"The Jarl has put out a bounty on some bandits. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
My Amulet of Arkay. It's the source of my divine powers and also a sacred badge of office.
"I misplaced it in the catacombs. I'd look for it, but I've been hearing noises down there. I fear the dead have become... restless."
"Without that amulet, I'm powerless to confront them. Would you be willing to search for it?"
"I believe I am, yes. Technically speaking, of course. The city is also home to a priest, priestess, an alchemist, and I'm sure others who practice."
"Ah, that reminds me. Speaking of alchemists, I have some frost salts for Arcadia. She asked me to obtain them for one of her potions."
Would you be so kind as to deliver the frost salts for me? I'm sure Arcadia will provide some form of recompense...
"Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other. Maybe I'll test it on Farengar first..."
"Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice."
"Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other."
"Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice."
You did what?
"By the gods, you're serious. You'd better report this to Commander Maro right away. He's at the Penitus Oculatus outpost, up in Dragon Bridge."
The leader of the Dark Brotherhood? You mean Astrid? Dead? And this is no jest?
Ha! This is a stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the Dark Brotherhood's movements... waiting for the time to strike. That time is now!
"My agents have recently acquired the passphrase to their Sanctuary. It is, [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE] Every assassin in that hole must be put down!"
"You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!"
"We have a chance to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, forever. It's all up to you."
By all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it?
"This is a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised - a most generous reward!"
I'll make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've made Skyrim a better place.
"Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!"
Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!
It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there.
"The museum is opening, Madena."
Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing.
We have to catch up to him before it's too late.
"Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?"
Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.
Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this chamber. Your choice.
So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.
The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer.
We'll have to find another way around.
Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.
I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.
Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.
It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.
"We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're right behind you."
"We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lass. We're right behind you."
This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.
The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.
This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.
Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.
There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.
"Aye. Whatever you want to do, we're with you."
Falmer patrol up ahead. I don't think they know we're here.
He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.
Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.
I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a lake.
It's Mercer! Look... down there!
Damn it! There's no way through.
He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.
"Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him."
Let's keep moving.
Wait a moment... what's that?
"I'm on it, lass."
I think it's sweet Lu'ah is so worked up over her dead soldier...
"Yeah, but raising Draugr to take on both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? That's just crazy."
"True, but I'm not going to be the one to try to oppose her..."
"You may have noticed the College, just to the north there. Very prestigious place. Mages from all over Tamriel traveled here to seek knowledge."
"After the Oblivion Crisis was over, many felt that magic users were to blame. Elves, to be specific. It created a great deal of tension."
"A good many dark elves were driven from the city, and people became... uncomfortable with the presence of the College."
"Just about eighty years ago, there was a terrible disaster. The cliffs overlooking the Sea of Ghosts collapsed, taking most of Winterhold with them."
"In the middle of it all, the College was practically untouched. Many of the survivors were suspicious."
"Some believed the mages were behind the whole thing, and others felt they could have at least prevented it."
"Arch-Mage Aren assures me that his people had nothing to do with it, and I believe him. But Winterhold never recovered."
"Goodness, no!"
"They're simply scholars, they mean no one harm. I've had... several conversations with Arch-Mage Aren over the years."
"He's perfectly polite, if a bit guarded."
Better make sure.
I'm sure I heard something...
Nothing yet.
"Could have been my imagination, I suppose..."
Hmm. I don't see anything.
That's strange...
Running won't save you.
Got to be here somewhere...
You should run while you have the chance.
Maybe they're gone?
Who's there?
Hmm?
"Hold on, what was that?"
Did you hear that?
I'm going to check that out.
Must be my mind playing tricks on me.
"Hmm, nothing there after all."
Nothing there. Strange.
I must be getting jumpy.
Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
I've waited an eternity for this day.
My debt is repaid at last.
I vowed to have your head.
That takes care of that.
I can always use the practice.
That's how it's done.
I was just getting warmed up.
Another one for the Blades.
"That's the end of that, hmm?"
That seems to be all of them.
A shame it had to come to that.
Seems I still remember my old training.
I'm getting too old for this.
Where'd you go?
Anyone see anything?
I'm afraid I've lost them.
"Must still be here, somewhere..."
Don't let your guard down.
Where'd you go?
You think running will save you?
"Well, good. They're gone."
I think they're gone.
I don't see 'em any more.
Stay alert. They may not have gone far.
Hmm. Gone. I don't like it.
"Oho, so that's where you went."
Here we go again.
You should have run away.
There you are.
Over here!
Now you're mine!











Damn it.
You'll have to do better than that.
Not bad... but it won't save you.
I'm too old for this.
Damn you.
I could use some help over here!
"Aye, that I do. I've got to, if I hope to be as good as Eorlund Gray-Mane some day. In fact, I just finished my best piece of work."
"It's a sword. I made it for the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. It's a surprise, and I don't even know if he'll accept it. But..."
"Listen, could you take the sword to my father, Proventus Avenicci? He's the Jarl's steward. He'll know the right time to present it to him."
From Adrianne?
"Ah, this must be that weapon for the Jarl. Poor girl, so eager to prove herself. I'll present it to Balgruuf when his mood is... agreeable."
"Thank you. Please, take these few coins, for services rendered."
A fateful errand.  No few have chafed to face the Worm since first he set his soul-snare here at Sovngarde's threshold.
"But Shor restrained our wrathful onslaught - perhaps, deep-counselled, your doom he foresaw."
"No shade are you, as usually here passes, but living, you dare the land of the dead."
By what right do you request entry?
"Ah, my parlor. No finer place to boil eyes, no..."
"Petra, you traitorous grouse! Die!"
"I spit on you, dead sister."
"Fools! You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!"
"Yes, markedly so. Ulfric and his Stormcloaks made no secret of their disdain for the Dark Elves."
"In fact, they didn't seem to care much for anyone who wasn't a Nord."
"The folk of the Empire have always had a more cosmopolitan view of the world, so I'm glad to see them in charge."
You have no idea.
Did you know it was his decree that forbade the Argonians from living inside the city walls?
"I hope in his next life, he's reborn as an Argonian forced to live in a slum because of some bigoted Nord dictator."
"I'm joking, of course, but I'm a lot happier seeing the Empire running things in Windhelm."
"Well, not yet. The Empire hasn't been in charge for that long, and real change takes time."
"Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement."
"Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here."
"For the first time in a long while, I truly believe that there are brighter days ahead."
"In some ways, yes, but there is often opportunity in chaos."
"When a new government takes charge, records can be lost, taxes can be forgotten and laws aren't always enforced."
The new guards are often too busy learning their responsibilities to notice a few smuggled goods or minor robberies.
"Not that I'd ever get involved in any of those kinds of things, of course."
I almost didn't. I wasn't sure I could stomach having some Imperial tell me how to live my life.
I was ready to pack my things when Hermir came to me. She wanted to make sure I'd finish teaching her the smithing trade.
That girl's determination won me over. I suppose it didn't hurt that she said she only wanted to learn from the best smith in Skyrim.
"I couldn't let her run off to that pretender Eorlund Gray-Mane, could I?"
"Aye, that I do. I ain't sayin' he was perfect, but he knew what it meant to be a Nord."
"The Empire's always taken us for granted. Nords died by the thousands in the Great War, and what did the Empire do?"
"They outlawed the worship of Talos, Skyrim's most beloved son. There's thanks for you."
"I guess what I'm sayin' is, Ulfric stood up for us, an' for all Skyrim. So who's goin' to stand up for us now?"
"I don't care what the Imperials say -- when Ulfric Stormcloak died, one of Skyrim's greatest heroes was lost."
"Now at last, the Thalmor will get their way. The worship of Talos will finally be stamped out. Or so they think."
"Those true sons and daughters of Skyrim will never cease to worship mighty Talos. If we cannot do so in our temples, we will do so in our hearts."
"Oblivion take the Thalmor! I'll never give up Talos, not even if it means my life. Let them come and make me a martyr!"
"Every day is a struggle, but a Nord doesn't back down from a fight when the cause is honorable."
"I just wish things were simpler. In my days as a soldier, I knew who the enemy was, and how to defeat him."
"Unfortunately, a sword can't repair damaged buildings, feed hungry people or undo years of prejudice."
"I'd like to, but it's not as simple as that."
"Most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted."
"Until those people learn to accept the Argonians, they must remain outside, for their own safety."
"Old habits don't die easily, and we Nords can be as stubborn as stone."
I've taken the first steps toward doing so already.
"I met with several of the Dark Elves to discuss improvements in the Gray Quarter, but we have no real plans as of yet."
First we'll need to refill our coffers and stockpile stone and wood. The war took a heavy toll on Windhelm's resources.
"But I swore an oath to our Dunmer friends that, for as long as I sit on the throne of Windhelm, their needs will not be ignored."
"By inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house."
"I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems."
Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.
Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave.
"If you're not afraid of little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those salts."
"Your choice, friend."
That's the first bit of good news I've had since I set sail a year ago.
Here's your cut.
"The North Wind is my mistress, and I'm her master. I don't tolerate any disloyalty."
You looking for work? Got a sailor who thought running a gang of thieves would be more money than hauling my cargo.
"You make an example of that gang, I'll give you a year's worth of pay."
That's the spirit.
Coward.
Fine work. Here's your pay. Don't spend it all on mead.
"Oh yes. You're a fine fat one, aren't you!"
Give me just one... little... bite!
"Ah, yes. No fat on this one!"
Don't run. Stay for dinner!
"I've been waiting for you, my sweet one."
Come closer!
"No, no, no. I've got more blood than you know!"
"Winterhold has lost much of its history, and with that much of its power. I aim to change that."
"I've heard rumors of the resting place of the Helm of Winterhold, the very same helm that Jarl Hanse wore in the First Era."
"Hanse was in line to be High King of Skyrim, you know. Having that might get the ear of the other Holds and give me some authority."
Good. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for your return.
Then I have no work for you.
Can you believe that this hold used to contend for the throne of the High King? Now perhaps others will listen.
"Here, your reward as promised. You have Winterhold's thanks."
Good luck to you.
Then stop wasting my time.
Good luck.
As you wish.
"If I needed something from you, you would know it."
"Nothing. I'm busy, and I don't like being bothered unless I'm expecting something from you."
"Oh, don't give me that look. Fine. I supposed I can find some menial task to set your mind on. Hmm...."
We have something of a vampire problem. Bodies have been found with blood drained. I know of a den nearby you can wipe out as a precaution.
I don't expect you to be capable of even that.
"I give, and I give."
"Filthy creatures, aren't they? Living in the darkness, like they do. So uncivilized."
"I prefer finery. Like this. Here, for your trouble. And I suppose I should show you a little about Illusion magic for free, shouldn't I?"
Good luck to you.
Very well.
"As you were, then."
"Fine, then."
The honor will be mine.
Good. Honor to you.
Very well.
"Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but I actually believe you."
That's a touching story. Now get outta my face.
"A friend, huh? Well... then it's probably okay if I tell you."
I guess you don't hear too well. I never heard of this [QUOTE]friend[QUOTE] of yours.
"Well... when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're talking about."
Big talk for someone with a light purse.
You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.
Maybe it would. If you had it.
There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything. Just calm down.
You've got a lot of nerve. But not a lot of common sense.
Easy there. I don't want that kind of trouble. Guy ain't worth it.
Yeah. That's what it's going to take.
"Ah... so tender. Come here, you juicy morsel!"
Go away. Go away. Go away!
"It's hopeless. He told me. He's right, you know."
"Their fires lit up the night. All across Lake Rumare, like stars come to earth. It was beautiful, really."
"They were golden, even when they were dead. But their blood was red. I knew it would be."
"You don't think there's any hope, do you? I don't. He's right."
"He explained it all to me. Before, when I still understood. I don't remember, but I still know."
He'll tell you. Just ask. You don't even need to ask. He'll tell you anyway.
I finally understand what it all means. What it was all for. The killing. And the dying.
"I had a medal. It had someone's face on it. I threw it away, after. It didn't help."
"Ah. Ha ha! Come here, come here come here come here!"
"Yes, yes. Closer. I won't bite. Promise."
Come over here. Please pretty please?
"I have a present for you. A nice, shiny present."
A little closer.
"I'm going to eat well tonight, my darling!"
No! You can't be here! You're all dead! I already killed you over and over!
Rise from your graves to defeat this worm!
I shall have vengeance for the death of my husband. Rise!
"I could not raise him, but I will raise an army to avenge his defilement!"
You will not stop me from killing those who wage this pointless war!
Thank you for releasing us from her spell.
"Now we can rest in peace once again. Come Fjori, my love..."
Let me see that journal...
Thanks.


Help will arrive soon.
"Agreed, we can't afford to try again."
Are you here to help?
I will take back my family's castle.
"Good, the place is crawling with bandits.  We lost some good men trying to take it earlier."
"I suspect Brurid planned this, there's been bad blood between us since the king's death."
"But to invade my home, kidnap my family..."
"You ask a lot of questions for a mercenary.  Just get in there and open the gate, we'll try and provide help once that's done."
The front gate is locked so you'll need to use the mine entrance behind us.  Open the front gate and we'll try and give you some support.
My family is everything to me.  Clear the fort and on top of the posted reward you can have whatever items you'd like.
Only if I can help it.
But damn if I ain't almost sober.
"Hey. In the Bannered Mare, there's this bottle of Argonian Ale. The good stuff. Get it for me. They won't even know it's gone. Come on..."
"Well that all depends on you, now. Doesn't it?"
Not anymore. Thanks to you. Friend.
Are you ready to enter the Star and purge the soul of Malyn Varen?
"Have faith, mortal. I will be watching over you."
Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself.
"We've done it. The Star has been cut off from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence."
Go ahead. Take it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me.
Congratulations. You've altered the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
Now? You could use it for what we meant it for. Using black souls for enchanting.
"The Black Star will never decay, but it can no longer hold the white souls of lesser creatures."
You keep it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me. Congratulations. You've changed the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he could store his own soul inside. Become immortal.
"It drove him mad. Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished."
"Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went insane."
And who are you to challenge me? I have conquered mortality itself. I've spat in the eyes of the Daedric Lords.
This is my realm now. I've sacrificed too much to let you take it from me!
"Eventually, the Star will fade back into my realm in Oblivion, but I doubt you have the hundred or so years it would take to wait."
"No, only one option remains. I will send you inside the Star. You will banish Malyn's soul there."
"Tell me when you are ready, mortal."
"My Star has been restored and Malyn's soul has been consigned to Oblivion. You have done well, mortal."
"As was destined, you are free to use my Star as you see fit."
"Farewell, mortal. Know that Azura will be guarding over the threads of your fate in the Twilight."
"Oblivion has been watching you since the day you were conceived, mortal. Do not think that your life has been served by your will alone."
"Go now. I have seen the threads of your fate in the Twilight, and you still have much to accomplish."
"Hey friend, you wouldn't happen to be looking for unusual items would you?"
"First off, let's keep this between us. I picked these up from the graves in town so don't go blabbing about it to Kust."
"You have to understand, Gentle Repose is a fallow festering place I should have left a long time ago. This is one of the few ways I make any money."
Right now I've got a book that I think you might like.
"Yeah, if your interested then I'll give you the book for free. If you like it you can come back later and I'll have other stuff."
"I mean, it don't cost me anything to let you have one and the dead won't notice their stuff missing. heh."
Great.  Here you go. Come back later and I'll have other things.
I knew something was up. I'll make sure he doesn't disrespect this place anymore. Honesty is a rare thing to find these days. Thank you.
Burying the past is much harder than burying remains. I'm... I'm afraid of what you will think of me if I tell you about the things I've done.
Although I have not practiced in a long time I was once a wizard. Even when I was young my magic was undeniably powerful.
It was that power that brought me to the attention of the Thalmor. In the Summerset Isles it is a great honor to be chosen to serve the Thalmor.
They are the governing council of the Aldmeri Dominion. They lead us to attack the Empire and forced the Empire to agree to stop worshiping Talos.
It was during the war with the Empire that I was at the height of my power. As a Thalmor battlemage I laid waste the enemy.
"Men, women, children, no one was spared my wrath. I destroyed whole villages."
I dream about those days still. Except I'm not me. I can see myself there and I try to stop what I know is going to happen but...
Many of the Empire's troops were Nords at that point. Some of them could even have been from around here.
Thank you. May Arkay bless you. I won't forget this.
I knew he was troubled but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
"I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me."
"I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me."
"You - over here, quick. Before any of them show up!"
"Please, stranger! I need your help!"
"I will find you, Fjola!"
And begin.
Again!
"Good. We'll take a short break, then move on to wide-area destruction spells."
How do you manage to hold your ground like that?
"You have to remember, it's not about strength. It's about leverage."
But strength doesn't hurt.
"Well, no. I'm just saying there's more to defense than muscle."
I've heard some rumors... about you and Skjor.
"And if you want to keep having ears, you'll pretend you didn't."
Is it not allowed?
"It's not exactly forbidden, but even so... it's not true. So that's that."
You only use the little swords.
"It's called a shortsword, oaf. It's quicker. Sharper. Like a razorfish against a whale."
But whales eat razorfish.
And they always come to regret it.
You might do well to learn a smaller weapon. Vary your style a bit.
Tiny blades don't hurt enough. A sword needs weight.
But ten little cuts...
All I need is one to cut you in half.
"Well, when you put it that way..."
"You'll do all right some day. Today you need to keep training, though."
Enough with the training. I want to go fight something.
No fighting just yet. Not till Skjor says so. We train now.
Easy for you to say. You get to fight.
"But before I fought, I had to train."
"Relax, new blood."
I've been hunting on my own for years.
Fighting people is different. Smarter.
"Some of them, anyway."
You wanted to see me?
I worry that you've been spending too many nights out.
"Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle."
"You forget yourself, young one."
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Just... these hunters. We're all on edge.
That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.
How goes the hunt?
Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.
"What glorious prey. Come back alive, and with stories to tell!"
Always.
How are the young ones coming along?
Some are too happy to fight. Blood runs hot.
"I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down."
I hope so.
"Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you."
"What weapon do you like, Harbinger?"
"When I was young, I favored huge swords, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good hammer."
Big swords should always beat little swords.
Brave hearts beat lesser ones. That's the decider.
"Tradition is very important to me, son."
To me as well. I think we don't see the same tradition at play here.
"If you want to lead this pack when I'm gone, you have to see farther. Look closer."
Well which is it? Look farther or closer?
"Come on now, boy, you know what I meant..."
You speak in riddles sometimes.
I don't mean to confuse you.
It's not confusing... just frustrating.
"You're a strong warrior, Skjor. Your heart is fiery and that serves you well in battle."
"Thank you, Harbinger."
But even the bravest of men consider their actions. I want you to survive long enough to take the mantle.
Don't worry about me.
"Master, I..."
"My title is Harbinger, child. I am no man's master."
"Forgive me. You're just the one in charge, and it's what I'm used to."
"No one is in charge here. Each Shield-Brother is his own man, each Shield-Sister her own woman."
"Well why do I have to listen to Skjor, then?"
Skjor has been a warrior for a long time. You would be wise to listen to him.
Any warrior that gets to be old is either fearsome or a coward. I'll let you find out which Skjor is.
Do you think I could be a member of the Circle? Some day? If I work hard?
"Don't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you."
I just want to make sure I'm moving up.
"This isn't the military, son. There are no ranks."
But aren't the Circle in charge? And don't you lead them?
I guide the Companions. The Circle advises me. But we are all free warriors. Only our honor binds us together.
Why can't I train with Aela?
Because you wanted to learn the longer blades. Aela's never used anything bigger than a dagger.
It's just... I think our fighting styles are similar.
Well you can either get better with a bow or try to learn from me.
Should I be holding the blade further away than I would a smaller one?
"If you keep it in close, you'll have more control, but it can be harder to balance a strike."
"I guess that comes down to footwork, then."
"Exactly. When you have a big heavy weight swinging around your upper body, your lower body has to compensate or you'll fall right over."
It just feels so slow.
"It will feel that way for a while. But eventually you'll get used to it, and then you'll get faster with it."
"After that, the shortsword will feel like a knitting needle when you pick it up again."
I've never held a knitting needle.
Of course not. My mistake.
Are you prepared for tonight's hunt?
I've been thinking we need to be more... discreet.
There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.
You know the old man doesn't like it.
Let's just not be too obvious.
All these younglings scampering around.
Worried one of them is going to take your place?
Some of them might try. But that's not what I'm worried about.
What then?
That they might get themselves killed.
By you?
They should be so lucky.
Heard you had a bit of trouble near Solitude last week.
Just those same ruffians I was bringing in for the Shatter-Shields.
So much wasted breath in that crew.
I'm imagining you just standing your ground and letting them tire themselves out.
"I'm telling you, it works. Let them ring their own ears on my shield, then scoop them up off the ground."
"We all have different means to glory, Stonearm. Well done."
"I've got a bad grip on my shield, could you take a look at it?"
"I'm a warrior, not a blacksmith."
Can't you just tell me if the grip is bad?
"If Eorlund made it, it's more likely you're gripping it wrong. Find me tomorrow and we can go over it."
"One day when you and I are on the Circle, we can change how things are run around here."
I don't think that's how the Circle works.
"They're lording it over us all the time, though."
Young warriors are smart to listen to older ones. They've lived.
"What kind of weapon do you prefer? I like the smaller, quicker blades."
"Yes, you're very fond of saying that. You know I like hammers and axes."
Aren't they slow? I can get in and out before you have one swing.
Let's test that out some time.
Yeah? Why?
"Okay, okay! I'll leave him alone! I was just kidding around. Besides, if he'd only kiss me, I wouldn't have to beat him up all the time..."
Yes. Braith bullies me all the time. All the elders think I'm a milk drinker 'cause I can't fight. Nobody understands.
"If you can get Braith to leave me alone, I'll be your best friend... forever! I'll pay you, too! My whole life's savings - two septims!"
I'm not sure I like these Alik'r warriors hiding out here. They seem like trouble.
Keep it to yourself. They're not paying us to talk.
They'll be gone as soon as they've found whoever they're looking for. And we'll have all the more coin.
That's right. Old inn to the south. The oaf doesn't even bother to visit these days. What am I supposed to do if the dragons burn down the farm?
"You're a traveler, right? I have this letter for him. Let him know how much of a failure he is."
Good. You make sure the lug tips you when he gets it.
"Typical. Well don't mind me, then."
What's this?
"I guess some things never change. Thanks for bringing this to me. Here, for your trouble."
"Well, there are three of them. Arranged in three tiers, as you may have noticed."
The Plains District is so named because it's the closest of the three to the plains that surround the city. The inn and marketplace are found there.
"Most of the city's residents live in the Wind District, which is the middle of the three."
"Dragonsreach occupies the highest, which we call the Cloud District. From here, the Jarl can see all that goes on within his city."
Ulfric Stormcloak's head on a pike.
"Do you think Ulfric really cares about Skyrim's independence, or the welfare or its people? I promise you, he doesn't."
"He's nothing more than a barbarian renegade, whose lust for power has cost the lives of countless innocents."
With good planning and constant vigilance.
"Even now, my court wizard, Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these terrors."
We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
"But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back."
"Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do."
With good planning and constant vigilance.

"But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back."
"Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do."
"Ah, splendid! Our fine city has a proud history, and I'm happy to share what I know."
"The history of Whiterun begins with Jorrvaskr, the hall of the Companions. For a long time, it was the only building on the mountain."
"As time passed, a thriving community sprang up around Jorrvaskr, as was common with mead halls."
"Today, Whiterun is the jewel of Skyrim. I can say without boast that is the greatest city in all the holds."
"That is an old tale, but well known to those of us who serve in the keep."
"Long ago, there lived a mighty hero of the Nords. Olaf One-Eye. Olaf did battle with a fearsome dragon named Numinex."
"The struggle between Olaf and the dragon culminated in a mighty duel atop Mount Anthor, with Olaf the victor."
"Olaf returned in triumph to Whiterun. By his decree, the city's keep was rebuilt as a prison for Numinex."
"And so, from that time until this, our great keep has been called [QUOTE]Dragonsreach.[QUOTE]"
"Balgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war."
"When he became Jarl, I insisted on serving as his protector. He had no cause to argue."
"Gods, you are curious. Almost... dangerously so."
I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats.
"Powerful men have many enemies. More so, in times of strife. So you can imagine the dangers."
"Oh yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade."
"Take your pick. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead."
And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely.
"Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them."
"Well, not yet, anyway."
"Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an adventure."
"Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like old Olaf One-Eye once did."
What a fascinating conversation that would be!
"If I said that was a tedious question, would you be smart enough to know what I meant? Probably not."
"As long as I'm left alone to pursue my research, I don't care who gives the orders."
"Now, I'm a busy man and your pointless questions are boring me terribly. Good day."
"I'll put it simply, so you'll understand. I advise the Jarl in matters of magic."
"If the hold is faced with any threats or mysteries of a magical nature, I am called upon to explain things and suggest a course of action."
Hopefully that answer will satisfy you. Good day.
"Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person."
"In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts."
"Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire."
"In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name."
"So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines."
"If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject."
"Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward!"
Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the [QUOTE]White-Gold Concordat.[QUOTE]
"Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price."
"Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!"
"Let them come! I have no fear, for Talos is my ally and I am his prophet. His word is upon my lips, his voice in my throat."
Indeed. The temple here in the city is my charge.
The goddess's divine blessings have no doubt helped make Whiterun a thriving and prosperous city.
"After all, it is she who brings rain to our crops and fair weather on the harvest days."
"Somewhat, yes. At first it seemed a distant thing, heard only in the idle speech of guards and traders."
"When the wounded soldiers began to return from battle, I did what I could to help them."
"As more of the sick and injured came to the temple, my work as a healer became more important than my duties as a priestess."
"I wish only an end to the fighting, so that I can tend to the temple once more."
"He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed."
"If we don't do something, the enchantment will eventually fade, and the Star will slip back into Oblivion. Azura will have the last laugh."
"He did it. He actually managed to trap his own soul inside the Star, but it's falling apart. It needs more and more souls to sustain itself."
"Precisely. But it's not as simple as enchanting Malyn away. He's put up barriers. Souls are only allowed in, not out."
If we were to... somehow... send a soul inside the Star. One that was ready to overpower Malyn from the inside....
I understand if you need some time to prepare. Let me know when you're ready.
I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with.
"A special type of soul trap. Placing you inside the Star without fully killing you. Once Malyn has been dealt with, I'll bring you back."
Malyn's soul is beyond hope because his body is dead. But I'll be keeping you just slightly alive on this end.
"But be careful. If you die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. There's nothing anyone can do for you if that happens."
"Malyn's soul should be in the Star. Theoretically, purging him will be just like killing a ghost anywhere else."
"I'll have a magical tether to your soul while you're inside. Once you're done, it'll be as simple as pulling you back into your body."
Okay. Stand very still. This might sting.
"First, I'll need to grab hold of your soul."
"Now, take a deep breath."
"Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen."
"But his soul still resides within, protected by his enchantments. Until he is purged, my artifact is useless to you."
"Stendarr's mercy - you aren't one of them. Please, you've got to help me!"
"It's my wife, Fjola!  I think she's being held in this tower."
"I'm sorry, I'm just... you're right. Let me explain."
"Fjola, my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since."
"I heard a rumor that these bandits were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here."
"I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! Please, can you look for her?"
Honestly? I have no idea. But I've looked all over and the kidnappings here started around when she disappeared. So I have to hope...
"Thank you! I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble."
One of the guards dropped this key while I hid. I wager it will come in handy for you. Please hurry!
Until you can find out whether Fjola is here there's nothing I care to to discuss.
What news? Why isn't Fjola with you?
"That... I gave it to her on our wedding day. Help me, Divines... it's true isn't it?"
"I'm sorry. Keep the ring. I cannot bear the weight of them in my heart, and I must make the journey alone now. Thank you for... thank you."
"All right, snowback. Who are you, and what are you doing in my tower?"
Fjola?  How do you know that name?
Christer?  He's here?
"The fool's my husband. I'm Fjola - or I was, once. Don't you see?"
"I left that old scab. Came home to Skyrim, and found this rabble of bandits."
Didn't take much to prove myself and knock them into shape. Now every free blade from here to Windhelm wants to sign on for a piece.
And it won't end here. I'd die before I went back.
None. Not back to him.
Better men have tried. Let's finish this.
You think so? Let's see who the real woman is here.
I don't know. I never expected the old bag to follow me so far. Just get rid of him.
But don't kill him. I don't hate the man. I just want him to go back to his farm and forget about me.
Take my wedding band. Stuhn only knows why I've kept it this long. He'll recognize it. Tell him whatever you think will convince him to leave.
The ring itself is worth a few bits. Keep it as thanks for cutting off the last vestige of an unwanted fate.
Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here!
"I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you!"
What?  My Fjola would never...
You monster!  I'll kill you for this!
I didn't expect to see you again. What became of my doting husband?
"Oh, it's you. I didn't think you could handle this on your own. Did you get rid of Christer?"
Then stop wasting my time.
"How did... no, forget it. I don't care to know. I'm free of the little man, and that's what matters."
"I owe you a debt, and I aim to repay it. We'll see each other again someday. For now, goodbye, and thanks."
"Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back..."
"You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?"
"Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there."
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel."
Battle-Born! Give me your money!
I... I don't have any money.
"You'd better give me five septims right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose..."
"No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me."
"Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip."
We're going to make them pay.
Those bastards will regret raising their weapons against Jorrvaskr.
Let's get back to Jorrvaskr. We'll want to pay our respects to Kodlak's spirit.
"What is this, you think you're clever?"
"If you want to fight your way out of here, you have to do it in the Pit."
Gotta give the crowd a show.
Luckily there's no shortage of Pit bait around here. Now get in there and earn your freedom.
"All right, meat, it's time for you to earn your freedom."
"Well aren't you in luck. He's the next piece of gutter scum on the docket. Between you and me, I hope you cleave his arrogant head open."
All right. Head to the pit when you think you're ready.
"We don't just let people rot in cells until they've served their time. Here, you fight."
"If you win, you go free."
"If you lose, well, you'll know the freedom of Sovngarde if you're lucky."
"Thank you, thank you. No, please, hold your applause."
"One more song, what say you? Yeah? All right, then!"
Nnnnooowwwwwww....
"There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!"
"And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!"
"But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said..."
"[QUOTE]Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed![QUOTE]"
"And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!"
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
"Thank you, good patrons of the Bannered Mare! Thank you!"
Wait!
Looks like he's gone for good this time. But I don't think we should stick around to see if he comes back.
"Draugr creeping down the mountain to climb through my window at night, that kind of thing. I admit, I still don't much like the look of it."
Wait!
There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time.
I guess you get used to it.
Please place your hands on the altar. Azura wishes to speak with you.
"You visit us often, Thadgeir."
Most of my friends are buried here.
"There are a lot of good men buried here, Kust."
Men aren't good or bad. They're just men.
The fields will need cutting soon.
I suppose so. Seems like it was just turning summer yesterday.
And now winter is coming.
Narri! This mead tastes like water and the meat has gone off.
"The mead is same as it ever was and the meat is fresh, maybe your sense of taste has [QUOTE]gone off.[QUOTE]"
The impertinence! You never would have talked to me like that when I was Jarl.
"We had this same argument every week, even when you were Jarl."
"Tekla! It's good to see you, girl. How's Dengeir treating you?"
As he should I suppose.
"Hmmm, well don't take what you don't have to."
"Narri, do you think the war will ever end?"
I think the war is just an excuse. If it does end there will be a new reason and a new place.
But what about the banning of Talos worship? Isn't that worth fighting about?
"I don't know about you, tekla, but all my prayers are silent and who I pray to is still my own to decide."
"Leave me alone, Lod."
"Ah Tekla, you're a pretty little mouse."
"Alright, but if you ever want to leave that old curmudgeon I've got plenty for you to do at Gentle Repose."
"I wish I could afford to pay you both, Narri.  I really do."
At some point we should hire Tekla on here. If she could just spend less time serving Dengeir...
"Keep them coming and keep them strong, Valga."
Will do.
The way this war is going you'll soon have plenty of veterans like me to buy drinks.
The way this war is going there might not be anyone left to drink soon.
"Hey gossip, bring me a drink."
"Bolund, you're going to die of thirst if you keep calling me that."
"Hey, Lod, how is the worst farmer in the hold doing?"
"The Gentle Repose is barren, it was barren the day my father claimed the land and it's barren now."
"Sure it is, Lod. Sure it is."
"Do you ever get tired of long nights at the mill, Zaria?"
"Do you ever get tired of the long days on the farm, Mathias?"
"Yes, yes I do."
Mathies. I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to your girl.
How's the Corpselight treating you Mathies?
"That's kind of you, Lod."
"You know how farming is here, long days and little to show for it."
Do you think Tekla has been talking to Siddgeir again?
"We've been over this, Den. Tekla does not share your secrets with Siddgeir."
Hmmf. Maybe you're the one talking to him then...
Tekla. The Hall is filthy. See to your cleaning.
Yes sir.
"Don't let my brother get to you, Tekla. You're doing a fine job around here."
Thank you sir.
"Falkreath is a fine place to be, Bolund."
Another day in this graveyard.
"Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!"
"Falkreath is our home, a place where we have good jobs under a good Jarl. Until the war comes to us we stay put."
"Ah, Indara. Arkay's blessing upon you and your husband. Spend as much time here as you need."
"Thank you, Runil. Your support means much to us."
"The temple is the one place my wife finds peace these days, Runil."
"It is a hard time for all of us. I hope that you too can find some sanctuary here, Mathies."
The graveyard has been lonely. Few pay homage to the dead.
"Few want to be reminded of mortality in a time of war, Kust."
"Preparing the defenses is almost impossible lately, every time we get a new war report our needs change."
The trade routes are affected as well. Procuring supplies is a guessing game. Weapons sell well though.
"Mmmm, careful with that, Nenya, our merchants could be selling weapons to an invading force."
"Why have taxes not come in from Granite Hill, Nenya? We should send some guards down there."
"They are only a little late, Jarl. The trade routes are affected by the war, we should give them another day."
"Very well, but when their emissary arrives I want words with him."
Helvard! The guards are looking sloppy today. I want you to reduce their wages for the month.
"Sir, I will shape them up but with the war on it is unwise to reduce their wages any further."
We can't afford to lose any men if we wish to keep Falkreath protected.
I would think a man of your military training would be able to do with less but so be it.
"Yes. Their history and culture is all around us in Markarth. A race of stonecutters, artisans, and engineers."
They invented machines and built elaborate underground cities where they researched powers to rival the gods themselves.
"And then, at a time we are still not sure when, they disappeared. The whole people, all at once. Leaving behind only their works."
"Ah, now that is a good question. Where does Hogni get the finest, freshest meat from all over the Reach?"
The answer is simple. Orcs. There is a stronghold nearby whose hunters can butcher a deer in seconds.
"Now having an Orc for a wife would be something, yes. Strong and bulky. Too bad they don't let people go beyond the walls."
Let me show you where they are. Maybe they welcome you. Maybe they put an arrow in your face. Who knows?
"It all started here. This rebellion. When the Empire lost the Reach during the Great War, we became desperate."
We promised a group of Nord militia free worship in exchange for their help retaking the Hold. Then the Elves found out about it.
"We were forced to arrest all of them. Ulfric Stormcloak, their leader, used the whole thing as proof that the Empire had abandoned Skyrim."
"The rebels called it [QUOTE]The Markarth Incident.[QUOTE] It was the founding day for the Stormcloaks, and where this war really started."
The White-Gold Concordat. Our treaty with the Elves after the Great War forbids free worship of Talos.
"But that's what we promised Ulfric and his men. It seems foolish looking back, but at the time we were hoping the Elves wouldn't find out."
"So when they did find out, it was either we arrest Ulfric and the militia, or enter into yet another war with the Aldmeri Dominion."
"The choice was clear. And now, Ulfric threatens the thinly veiled peace we sacrificed so much for."
"When the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Imperial City, the Legion all but turned a blind eye to the other provinces."
"Many of the disgruntled natives of the Reach used the opportunity to depose the Empire, and founded what they called an independent kingdom."
"It was little more than a chaotic uprising, but the Reach was removed from Imperial authority for two years before we reclaimed it."
But the leaders of the uprising refused our offers of peace. They fled into the hills and became the Forsworn.
"Yes, I know. We have some advantages if they come here. The city is built into the mountainside, so it's hard to reach into even from the skies."
And everything is made of stone. Even the beds. We'll have no trouble from dragon's fire here.
"A heathen. Lovely. Oh, don't put on that angry look. I'm just teasing you."
Dibella is the Divine of Beauty. She is a patron deity to artists and bards and those who seek life's simple pleasures.
The temple offers her blessings to pilgrims and instruction in enjoying all life has to offer.
"Well, you are lovely to look at, and there's so many things I could teach you, but I'm afraid the Temple isn't taking in new students."
"The Imperials were weak. They created this Forsworn problem, but now that we're in charge we'll solve it."
"Once the war is over, I'll petition Ulfric to send the militia and we'll cleanse the Reach of this menace."
"Then the Forsworn will be where they belong. In the mines, bringing us wealth."
The stone structure the Dwarves have left makes us invincible. Let the dragons singe a few carpets. They'll never topple Markarth.
"Through neglect. During the Great War, they let the unwashed natives retake the Reach and declare their own sovereignty."
"The Stormcloaks were forced to retake the Reach on our own, but that taste of independence emboldened them. And the Forsworn were born."
"In the end, we took back Markarth, but those damn Forsworn still stalk the hills and roads, looking for revenge."
"If you could call it that. The Jarl can make all the demands in the world, I'm not setting one foot on the battlefield."
"I fought in the Great War. I cut enough young lives short, I'm not going to do it again."
"The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured."
Dawnstar has a history of being the site of battles that have crippled the fate of the Empire. I hope this remains true.
The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him.
"As soon as we drive the Empire out of Skyrim, the dragons will vanish. Mark my words."
Yes. Ever since mother died a few winters ago. I play songs and help with the drinks when I have the time.
"The Empire has stretched itself too far. This rebellion in Skyrim is one problem, but solving it won't fix everything."
"But that's the kind of talk an old warhorse shouldn't be making. Don't worry. I have my problems with the Empire, but I'm still a soldier first."
We'll keep peace and order in Dawnstar.
No. We're completely exposed. Bows and arrows are in short supply. Every building is made of thatch and wood.
"I've given standing orders to the guards to prepare water bucket runs to the harbor in case of a fire, but that's all we can do."
These fissures and cracks aren't encouraging. Malyn obviously was growing more desparate once he left the College.
The Star is being used to sustain Malyn's soul. I can't fix it while that fragment of him is inside.
Just give me a moment.
Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
"Thanks to your efforts, the Guild's been restored to it's full strength and you've exposed the traitor in our midst."
"As a result, we both feel that you'd make an excellent replacement for Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild."
Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
"Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full strength."
"As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild."
"I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder."
"I'm good at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know."
"I've never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't want it."
"Well, we have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation, so don't get sentimental on me now."
Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild.
Just don't lose yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation.
"Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true."
And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He lacked the loyalty you obviously possess.
I can't think of anyone better.
"Then it's decided. When this entire sorry affair is over, we'll handle the details."
"Until then, we have quite the task ahead."
"Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure me that we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details."
"Until then, we have quite the task ahead."
"I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand."
"Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will be a fight to remember!"
"I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand."
"Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lass. This will be a fight to remember!"
"Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please."
I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history.
The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity.
"I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you."
"There is no one else, but very well. I cannot force you to accept your destiny."
"The mages are up in the College. You can ask them, if they'll let you in."
"Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College, but he has a room here."
Did you say an [QUOTE]elf[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]stars[QUOTE]? I hope you don't know what you're asking.
[QUOTE]An elf that studies stars[QUOTE]? Where did you hear about that?
"Studies stars you say? Why, there hasn't been a mage doing anything related to stars since.... Oh...."
"Why specifically stars? Wait, you aren't referring to... No, there's no way you would know about that."
"I know plenty of spells that produce light, but stars? Hmm. There was that problem a few years ago, but that couldn't be related."
Stars? You wouldn't be referring to that incident a few years ago? I still say that exile was far too harsh.
"Why would anyone bother to study stars? Well, unless you're talking about that artifact that got all those... dimwits thrown out."
Studies stars? I remember the last time the word [QUOTE]stars[QUOTE] was flown through the Hall of the Elements. Bad things had happened.
There was an... unfortunate incident a few years ago. An elven mage named Nelacar was exiled from the College over it.
"He's still in town, getting by plying spells to the people inside the Frozen Hearth. Disgraceful."
"Officially, nothing."
"Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one."
"Well, it's a... minor stain on the College's reputation. One of many, unfortunately."
"You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back."
"It was a few years ago. A few of the mages got overconfident and were exiled. They had no talent, anyway."
"I hear one of them, Nelacar, still hangs around the Frozen Hearth. Guess he has no where else to go, poor thing."
There was some bother about a group of mages being exiled. I can't remember what the details were.
"I think one of them came back. Nelacar. Stays at the Frozen Hearth, but I don't know why. He's not welcome in the College."
You shouldn't ask me. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. He's the one to talk to.
"Oh, no, I'm not falling for that one again. Next thing I know, I'm getting yelled at for saying something inappropriate."
"If you're so curious, talk to Nelacar, in the Frozen Hearth. He can tell you the whole sad story."
The kind of things that even the College won't tolerate. Things that can get a wizard exiled for life.
"There's an Altmer who's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Nelacar. You should speak with him, if you're so curious."
Who sent you? Was it the College? The Jarl? We agreed there would be no more questions.
"Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm inside of Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to damn him."
It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't said.
"Then one day I walked in and Malyn had... killed a student, and in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his work."
"I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted? There's another rule the artifact follows."
"You can only store white souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic won't allow black souls to enter it."
"As a mortal, Malyn's soul was black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was close before... well, I already told you."
"Good. All will be revealed in time. Keep playing your part, and Azura will reward you."
I will commune with Azura.
Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star.
"Maybe this is my chance to make things right. I can finish Malyn's work, the way we had meant to before his madness."
It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura. Only black souls would be able to enter it once we finished.
Are you ready to give me the Star?
Intruder! Help!
Help! In here!
Backup! I need some help in here!
Over here! Hurry!
"Now, cast the ward spell, and keep it up."
Hold still...
"You have to keep your ward up, or else this won't work. I don't want to hurt you."
Excellent work!


The General has sent me to obtain a powerful weapon for the war effort.
"This was the last great bastion of the Dragon Cult, and their leader's mask was reported to be quite powerful."
You there! You look like a sympathetic soldier. I require your assistance!
Very good.
"Let's see... found the Dragon Cult... laid siege... people already dead... poisoned themselves... blah, blah, blah...  ah! Here it is!"
"So the Dragon Cult poisoned their own well, which explains the ghosts. However, Skorm thought the well was the key to entering the inner areas."
"That all happened in the First Era, so the well should be clear of poison by now. It says the key to the well is likely somewhere in the crypt."
I'll do you ten gold at three to one on the white one.
Sounds like easy money to me. You're on.
Get him! Rip his throat out!
"Give em the dogs, boys!"
So you're the one who's been down there killing all my wolves. You're gonna die for that!
"I own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
"I pay a good wage for any iron ore you dig up, if you're looking for work."
"That would be Jarl Skald the Elder. He's over in the White Hall, probably talking about Ulfric like he's the second coming of Talos."
"Jarl Brina Merilis is in charge, thanks to the Empire. Best hide any Talos amulets you have."
"Skald supports Ulfric's rebellion, and he doesn't like having a couple of old Legionnaires living in his town."
He's a fool. A dragon has attacked Helgen. Dawnstar needs the Empire now more than ever.
Drowning your troubles in mead? A lot of folks are doing that these days. You'll want the Windpeak Inn.
"As for work, you could try to catch Skald in a good mood, but your best bet would be working in the mines. They're on opposite ends of town."
"My mother taught me. She was a Bard, from the college in Solitude."
"I hear they accept most people who apply, if you're ever interested."
"That would be Skald the Elder. He's been running Dawnstar ever since he was a boy, and he never lost that brat's attitude."
Turned on the Empire first chance he got. Now we're all part of this rebellion.
Brina Merilis came in with the whole damn Legion and deposed Skald. Couldn't have happened to a better man.
"If you don't mind digging, I own the Quicksilver Mine. It's a better life than working in that damned Iron-Breaker Mine with all those milk drinkers."
Good luck.
"It was supposed to be an honor, but very well."
"Giants are a common problem in the Pale. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now."
Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that Dawnstar is not to be trifled with.
I'm counting on you.
You don't have time? Fine.
You've shown those monsters that they will no longer be tolerated in the Pale. Good work.
"Here, a reward from your Jarl."
"If you've got an axe, you can always make gold chopping wood. Just bring me everything you cut."
That I am. My father left it to me after he died in that Great War against the Elves.
I don't care what's going on in the world. Rebellion. Dragons awakening. The mill is enough trouble for me to worry about.
How the tree came to grow there is a bit of a mystery...
"Some say that when Vvardenfell erupted, a piece was blown to the middle of Skyrim and from the crater grew the tree."
"I've also heard that it was a spore that fell from an island floating in the sky, but that just sounds like nonsense."
"All I know is that the sap makes you feel as healthy as a cave troll, but slow as a drunk horker. And that and it fetches good coin."
"Well met, hunter."
"No? Well, then she hasn't gotten to you yet. But she will. And you don't you believe a word of it."
"Oh she will, mark my words. And don't you let her."
Shop at Belethor's for the best prices and selection. He pays me to say that.
Hm hmm.
We done?
Best if... you didn't mention to anyone that you saw me here.
I've said too much already.
Remember - don't trust the Imperials. No matter what honeyed lies they tell you.
Live long. Fight well.
"You take care of yourself, now."
"If you need any jewelry, just let me know."
"If you need a drink, just holler."
"Yeah, take care."
Come back anytime if you need a remedy.
Do forget to see me at my shop sometime - Arcadia's Cauldron.
Stay out of trouble.
Keep your nose clean.
"Need anything else, just let me know."
I think I've got some mugs need scrubbin'.
"Goodbye, dear."
Is it cold in here? I should put more wood on the fire...
"Now please, no more questions."
"If there's nothing else, I have work to do..."
You should buy some produce from Carlotta's stall. Most of it comes from my farm.
You should stop by my farm if you get a chance. See what life's really about.
"It's the leaving that's hardest, I know."
Some parting advice - women love sonnets.
"Yeah, take care of yourself."
Do come back.
"Remember, I'll give you the best deals, or die trying."
"Next time, come see my at my shop. I've got some things you'll just love."
Good doin' business with ya.
"We'll have to have a pint together sometime, you and me."
Good hunting.
"Remember, I've got the freshest meat in all of Whiterun."
Right. Till next time.
Thank you very much for your business.
Farewell.
I was done talkin' anyway.
"You go on your way now, boy."
"You go on your way now, girl."
"Farewell, my lady."
"Farewell, sir."
Take care.
You watch yourself out there.
"Keep your eyes open for those Stormcloak dogs, yeah?"
"Do be careful, child. Skyrim is not as safe as it used to be."
"By the way, you might want to stop in at Warmaiden's. These days, folk need all the protection they can get."
Long live the Empire.
"The Stormcloaks are living on borrowed time, believe me."
"May your sword be sharp, and your tongue sharper."
"Keep a song in your heart, and a blade in your boot."
"It's back to work, then."
I'll see you.
"Yes, yes. Goodbye."
May all your possible futures be bright.
"Remember, fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Mostly."
Thanks for the business.
I've really got to be going.
I think I hear my daughter calling...
"Goodbye, ma'am."
"Goodbye, sir."
May Talos guide you. Always.
Stay vigilant! Our enemies are legion!
"Goodbye. And if you happen to see Mikael, tell him I was asking about him..."
Farewell.
See you.
"Right, then."
Hmm hmm.
We done?
"Finally. I got stuff to do, ya know."
Back to my book...
"Damn it, I lost my page..."
The blessing of Arkay be upon you.
"Walk always in the light, in these days of darkness."
Sure. Whatever.
"Bye, now."
Don't let the door slam into your backside on the way out.
"Now if ya don't mind, my house could do with a bit of dusting."
Grace of Kynareth be with you.
"Travel great Skyrim, and Kynareth travels with you."
"You need to be careful in this city. Never know who you can trust, these days."
"Goodbye, dear."
"Right, I really am busy. So..."
"If there's nothing else, I really do have important matters tend to."
"If you run into my husband Nazeem, remind him that he's not married to himself."
Take care of yourself.
"You know, if you've got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold..."
"Remember, your mind is the best weapon you have."
Stay sharp.
Don't forget to check inside the shop if you need anything.
Thanks for the business.
Enjoy your visit to Dragonsreach.
"If there's any more I can help you with, just let me know."
"Next time, deal with Avenicci."
"Now if you don't mind, I've got a city to keep."
Maybe we'll meet in the field. Just pray we're on the same side.
"If you run into any Stormcloaks, kill a dozen for me."
I've got my eyes on you.
"Mind yourself in front of the Jarl, or we'll have serious problems."
Ride strong.
"You always keep us in mind when you need a fresh horse, yeah?"
Uh huh.
"Back to work, I guess. There's never a shortage of dung to shovel around here."
Good. Chat time's over.
"Yeah, whatever."
"Please, leave me to recover my... mental energies."
"Riften's biggest exports used to be fishing and honey, until the Black-Briar family moved in. Now the meadery is the biggest game in town."
The Thieves Guild has been pushing hard to regain a foothold in this city. Rumor has it they're falling apart from the inside.
The city guard has been tearing Riften apart looking for the source of our skooma problem. I'd hate to be in their shoes if they get discovered.
Sibbi Black-Briar is furious that his ex-lover tried to murder him. He's leaving no stone unturned searching for her.
Mjoll the Lioness used to adventure across Skyrim before she settled down in Riften. I hear it all ended when she lost her enchanted blade.
Crime is at an all-time high in this city thanks to the Thieves Guild. Don't we have enough problems with the war going on?
"If Maven Black-Briar keeps raising prices on mead, I'll have to resort to watering it down just to make ends meet."
"If it's true that the dragons have returned, what will it mean for all of us? Is this how it all ends?"
They mean to take our history and crush it all in the name of some damn treaty.
The soil beneath our feet is steeped in the blood of our ancestors. We've fought for this land and... died for it.
"I lost my own daughter to the Imperial dogs, and by Talos I'll not lose anyone else!"
Talos is part of our culture. He's part of our heritage and our tradition. He's Skyrim personified.
To suddenly have all that wrenched away is like losing someone you hold dearly in your heart.
"The Empire already took my daughter from us, but by Talos they will not take our homeland!"
"Lilija joined the Stormcloaks many years ago, when the first of the skirmishes broke out across Skyrim. I was so proud of her."
"She served as a Battle Maiden, using her healing arts to help those that fell on the battlefield. Never even lifted a blade in her life."
It didn't matter. The Imperial soldiers cut her down... killed her like a dog and left her body to rot in the mud.
"And that's why I won't rest easy until every single Imperial soldier joins her, and Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim."
I trained our daughter Lilija as a healer... to one day tend the Shrine of Talos and replace me as a Priestess of Talos.
"When the fighting began over the White-Gold Concordat, she ran off to join the Stormcloaks. She had her father's fire, how could I say no?"
"She died out there, only having tended to the wounded soldiers for a few months. We never even found her body... the Empire burned all the dead."
"It was my sister, Lilija. She served as a Battle Maiden with the Stormcloaks."
We recently heard she'd been killed... I... I find it difficult to talk about. Perhaps you'd be better off speaking to my parents about it.
"Anyway, I'm glad my work at the Black-Briar Meadery keeps me busy. Helps me keep my mind off of things."
My father was a Stormcloak soldier in his younger days. Now he just walks the streets spewing his hatred and propaganda.
My mother is the Priestess of Talos. She tends to the shrine and teaches his ways. I'm just not so sure she's delivering the right message.
"Sorry, fresh out. Maybe next time."
Absolutely. Did you still want to buy one?
Nothing but the best. Black-Briar Mead... fresh from the vat.
"Best of all, you don't have to pay the ridiculous prices Maven charges. So what do you say to that?"
"Here you go. Oh, and keep it quiet. This stuff isn't exactly easy to get a hold of at these prices, if you catch my drift."
"Suit yourself. If you change your mind, I'll be around."
Sure. How do you think I get my hands on the good stuff and offer it so cheap? You think old Maven is just giving it away to anyone?
Good thing she makes so much money. Makes it easier for merchandise like this to fall through the cracks.
Take this with our gratitude.
"I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that, it's hard to say."
"Events in the last several hundred years resulted in a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid."
"The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known."
"An unfortunate natural disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched."
No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later.
"I know there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were responsible. I assure you this is not the case."
"Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out.  You see..."
"Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!"
"No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!"
We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!
Crystal....  gone...
[coughing]
Find... Paratus... in Oculory...
"What brings you, wayfarer grim, to wander here, in Sovngarde, souls-end, Shor's gift to honored dead?"
Beware! The World-Eater waits within the mist!
There is no escape. Courage is useless.
None may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.
"Living or dead, by decree of Shor, none may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test."
Yamarz has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave.
I must petition Malacath for relief. This curse must be lifted.
"But I cannot travel to Malacath's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need."
"I beg of you, can you bring me Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice."
"Lost it? Well, at least you showed signs of initiative by telling me."
I guess I shouldn't be surprised with the way things are going around here.
"Someone lied. Someone told the guard poor Cicero did something he did not. We were detained, delayed! The Night Mother kept from her new home!"
"But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hmmm? No. No... Of course not. Because then Cicero would get angry, and that would be... ugly."
Now Loreius. Loreius has learned the meaning of ugly.
"I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to, you know... clean up the mess."
"When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots of children, just like you."
You came to visit! It's so much better here with Grelod gone. Thanks to you.
"I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery!"
"I know, I know, how could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared a few drinks?"
But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of flesh.
"Details, details. The Sanguine Rose breaks all the time and is fixed with but a thought."
"In fact, here it is now. Think of it - a never-ending stream of minions. And all of the prestige of being Sanguine's chosen."
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Calcelmo's orders- no one gets through to the tower. Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need to.
Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born.
"You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted."
"You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it."
"Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night."
"It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter."
I've been looking for you.
Thank you for coming.
"Sigrid! Love of my life! When you get a spare moment, I could use some water."
"Don't you sweet talk me, Alvor. Not after last night. I'll bring you water when I'm done with my other chores."
"Woman, you'll be the death of me yet. Fine, take your time. I'll just die of thirst in the heat of this forge."
"Care to have a drink with me, sweet Sigrid?"
"Drunk again, Embry? Don't let Alvor hear you talking to me that way. He'll stick your head in his forge."
So that's a no I take it?
It seems like Dorthe grows a head taller every season.
"Aye. She's helping me in the house, and even helps her father at the forge."
She'll make a fine wife someday.
Thank Shor I have a lot of years before I have to worry about that!
Please! Release me! Cut my bonds!
You cut these bindings this minute! You hear me? You cut these bindings right now!
"Come now, my friend. Haven't we played this game long enough? Untie me, and we can all go our separate ways."
"Thank you! Thank you! I'll never speak of this to anyone, I promise!"
"Well it's about damn time. Capturing a woman from her home, keeping her bound like an animal. Ridiculous..."
"Ah, you see? That wasn't so hard, now was it? Let's the two of us just forget we ever met, hmm?"
He is our creator and master. The Daedric Lord of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
Malacath teaches us to honor all words with action. To demand blood from your enemies and strength from your allies.
He watches over all Orcs as his children. A truth those who leave the stronghold are quick to forget.
"The Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price."
"The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it."
"For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood."
It is said that an Orc first learns to wield a hammer in her mother's womb.
"By tradition, a mother always teaches her children how to smith. If a chief has a second wife, she is called the [QUOTE]Forge-wife[QUOTE] in honor of this."
"We have lived in Skyrim since before the Nords came. Our way is simple, all work to make the tribe strong."
"Only the bravest are allowed to lead, and to marry. A great chief is able to attract many wives and raise bold children."
Wise women like myself are mothers of chieftains. We guide the tribe and advice our kin on what is most pleasing to Malacath.
I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.
You should try that bit on the barkeep. Maybe get yourself a free drink.
That amount should allow me to readily acquire a drink.
I'll be at the market come morning. You better be there too.
I'm ready when you are. Just give the word.
Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
"Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!"
"Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. He's really doing it!"
Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
"Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!"
"Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. Looks like he really did it!"
"A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died."
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he's trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. I really hope he does.
"A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died."
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he was trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. Did he really do it?
"Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away."
"I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, and is trying to get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. That would be so wonderful."
"Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away."
"I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, to try and get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. And... he actually pulled it off!"
"Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away."
"But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and is doing some kind of dark ritual. He's trying to summon some killers to come get old Grelod."
"Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away."
"But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and did some kind of dark ritual. He summoned killers to murder old Grelod. He's saved us all."
"And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you."
"That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here, until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world."
"Now, what do you all say?"
"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?
"Yes, Grelod."
"Yes, Grelod."
"Yes, Grelod."
"Yes, Grelod."
"That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes."
I'm lucky enough that none of my friends have been killed. Of course we have soldiers coming through all the time.
Those falls... dangerous place. Derkeethus thought he could find some good fish in the pools.
Haven't heard from him in a long while.
"Not much to it, really. We fish, and keep to ourselves. Try to keep from upsetting the Empire or the Stormcloaks, and so far the war's left us alone."
A bunch of lazy rabble trying to make a living. Can't get better workers in because everyone's afraid of the tomb up above the mine.
Dead dragons... it hasn't moved since Ysgramor and it's not going to start now. Superstitious milk drinkers.
So it seems the milk drinkers were right. That dragon was nearly the death of us.
All we can do now is rebuild.
We got the mill up and running before we found out that the big stand of trees on the hill was sacred.
"Now we can't cut them, and can't afford to buy another mill somewhere else."
So we scrounge whatever we can from around the tundra.
"A lifetime of study, you might say. The best comes from Riften, but I haven't been there in years."
Ever tried making your own? It's... not easy. Trust me.
Not at all. I consider it a blessing.
"My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do."
Mages in Cyrodiil are all about politics. The Synod and the College of Whispers are too busy guarding secrets to bother to teach.
"Skyrim was not J'zargo's first choice, but Winterhold is removed from politics, dedicated to study. This is the place for J'zargo to become great."
"So far, if only because no one is telling me how great I ought to be."
"I just want to learn, I don't want to think about what's expected of me."
Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that.
"For centuries, we have benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with the south."
"In exchange, the people of Cyrodiil sleep peacefully, knowing their northern border is guarded by the fiercest warriors in all Tamriel."
"And here you go... your payment, just as I promised."
"The way things have been going around here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch."
I didn't think you'd get pinched.
Can't say I'm surprised with the way things have been going around here.
"Magic is shunned by most. If it can't be swung over your head and used to crack skulls, most Nords want nothing to do with it."
"Magic is seen as something for elves, and weaker races."
Not at all. I consider it a blessing.
"My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do."
"Well, look at the evidence. Nords generally don't trust magic, so it's not off to a good start."
"Throw in the Oblivion Crisis, which was caused by magic-users, and the troubles now with the Aldmeri Dominion, who are elves and magic users."
And finally take the fact that the College is the only thing left standing after most of Winterhold was destroyed. It's all fairly damning.
"Well, that depends on what you're looking for."
"Faralda can teach Destruction spells, and offers training in that school."
"Phinis is one of the best Conjurers in all of Skyrim, and can help with spells from that school."
"Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent scholar on Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always willing to pass on his knowledge."
"If you can find him and focus his attention, there's a great deal Drevis can teach you about Illusion magic."

"And finally, there's Colette. She may be... difficult to get along with, she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic."
You... You can see me?
"Confound it all. I was quite sure I was invisible, or at least transparent."
"But you can hear me, obviously. Something still isn't quite right. At least I'm making progress."
"Oh my, that's quite a difficult question."
"Never underestimate the ability to influence others. Whether they're friends or foes, they're almost all susceptible to Illusion spells."
They can turn the tide of a battle in a moment's notice.
"There are also spells that help in avoiding conflict altogether. Invisibility is tricky to master, but exceptionally useful."
"Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes."
"Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss."
You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell.
"Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire."
"It's lies. All of it. I don't care what she told you, it's all lies."
"Faralda. Don't act like she didn't say anything. I know her, I know what she's been up to."
Now. Enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.
Are those parts ready yet?
"I can only hammer so fast, Gerdur."
They don't have to be perfect. Just send them over when they're ready.
Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...
"No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed."
"Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?"
"Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales..."
Ha! Then I'm right. I knew it. He's trying to have somebody killed!
"All right. I won't deny it, child. What you heard is true. But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin."
"Hmm. Yes, it is quite sad. A young boy, Aventus Aretino, lost his mother recently, and was sent to an orphanage."
"But he has returned home, and people have heard strange chanting. They say it's the Black Sacrament, the ritual to contact the Dark Brotherhood."
"Why a little boy would want to contact a group of murderers is beyond me, but he is inviting evil into this city."


"Go, boys! Attack!"
"If I am to die today, so be it. But you'll not soon forget the Dark Brotherhood."
Hmm? What is it?
Another soul for the master!
"I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this, so I simply won't."
"A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes."
"I undertstand. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here, please."
My guards told me. Poor Margret. And witnesses report that the attacker was shouting some nonsense about being a Forsworn.
"I want to make things clear. Markarth has its troubles, but there are no Forsworn in this city."
"They're only a threat in the hills and along the roads, where they live. Everywhere else, we are in control."
"It's unfortunate that we live in such violent times, but there you have it."
Now I've been told that the attacker claimed to be a Forsworn. It's nonsense. More likely he was just sick in the head.
So don't concern yourself with it. Markarth is safe. You have my word.
"He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood."
"I worship Peryite, yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease."
"Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take Him in."
"If you wish to commune with Him, we'll need the incense."
"Ah, no. Don't think you've got the stuff. Come back when you've seen a bit more in life, perhaps."
"Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? Have you come to commune with Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord?"
"Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot, a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how."
"I'll see you at Northwatch Keep, friend."
"Please, get word to my mother."
"Let's go, let's go!"
"Of course. I should've known. Avulstein was behind this, wasn't he?"
"Of course. I should've known. This was all Avulstein's idea, wasn't it? Where is he?"
"A wise decision, but I fear he may not be safe there anymore."
"They'll go looking for me, and Whiterun will be the first place they search."
So he might still be in there?
I don't dare go back in now. I'll just have to hope that in the confusion he can slip out.
Avulstein... you stupid boy...
"What is my freedom worth, if the price is my brother's life?"
"I cannot stay. Not here, not in Whiterun. It likely won't be safe for Avulstein, either."
Our best hope now is to fall in with the ranks of the Stormcloaks.
"But would you do me a favor? Tell my mother to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll know what it means."
"I thank you again, friend. You've given me my life back."
I don't dare return to Whiterun. But my mother... She'll need some consolation.
"Tell her... tell her to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll understand."
"Though shall mourn my brother, I thank you, friend. You've given me my life back."
"Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath."
"Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me."
"I give you my ring. Wear it, and when you feast on the flesh of the dead, I will grant you my power."
"Wallow in your wretchedness, my newest champion."
"Your mockery will be the end of you. And on that day, another servant will feast on your entrails and discover a ring clenched in her teeth."
Be grateful for what time I give you until then.
To Oblivion with your loot! This ends now!
You don't have what it takes to kill me.
For once you'll actually pay for your crimes.
"Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of others."
"You're the one who put out the fire in the Lighthouse, right?"
That was good work. Deeja's in the hold of the ship. Go down two levels.
I know it's a bit strange. Not exactly a name to bring comfort to the sick and ailing who come to buy a poultice or salve.
"But what you must understand about Falkreath is that our town is defined, for better or wrose, by the large and ancient cemetery here."
"That's why the inn is called Dead Man's Drink, the farm is called Corpselight Farm, and so on. I suppose it's sort of a running joke."
"Well, my family back in Hammerfell didn't approve of my interest in lethal poisons and death in general. So I left, and wandered north."
"When I found this town, with its huge cemetery, I felt right at home. I opened the shop and I've never looked back. This is where I belong."
I was Dengier's personal guard for years. I risked my hide more than once to protect him.
"Why would I do that? For money? Because I swore an oath? No, it was because he was a good man and a true friend."
A true Nord places loyalty and honor above all else.
His name's Bolund. He's the one who works the lumber mill down by the river.
"If you meet him, don't expect much in the way o' conversation. He ain't one for talking, especially with folk he don't know."
"I was once, but not any more. I was wounded in a skirmish up near Windhelm. This was years ago, mind you."
"Now, maybe I don't pick up a blade in Ulfric's name no more, but I still hold with his ideals. Skyrim is Nord land, and we ought to rule it."
We don't need no help from the Empire on that count.
You think some Emperor sitting on a gilded throne in Cyrodiil is going to know what's best for Skyrim?
"The Imperial City's so far from here, it might as well be on one of the moons. And yet the Empire thinks it can tell us what to do an' how to live."
"I'm no man's fool. I know Ulfric Stormcloak's selfish and power-hungry, but he's the devil I know. Does that put it plain enough for you?"
"For one thing, I won't empty Falkreath's coffers to buy myself fine clothes an' expensive mead."
"For another, I won't get mixed up with criminals and other sorts who take advantage of the honest folk for profit."
"I might be old, but I haven't forgotten that a Jarl's first duty is to look after his people."
"Aye, not so long ago. Some'll tell you I stepped down on account of my old age."
"Truth is, I found out about all the Imperial spies crawling around Falkreath. A few well-placed bribes, and they bought themselves some friends."
"Suddenly the nobles are calling for a new Jarl, and all the while their pockets are jingling with the sound of Imperial septims."
"They named me Thane, and they got my nephew Siddgeir in my place. A real friend to Cyrodiil, that one."
I should think so! I'm well used to taking care of a house and the folk living in it.
Taking care of the entire hold is another matter entirely. It would be a big enough job without the war on and the dragons about.
I just hope I can do right by the good folk who are looking to us to see to their needs.
"Comes down to trust, I expect. After Dengeir gave up his seat to his nephew, he didn't trust anyone."
"Everywhere he looks, he sees assassins, spies an' plots against him. I'm the only one he confides in."
"So, when he was made Jarl again, he didn't wait a moment to name me his Steward. He said I was the only choice."
"Master Arngeir, are you going to just let him continue to..."
I have something to say first.
Here we go.
The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
We have no interest in negotiating with the Empire. It's only a matter of time before they are driven out of Skyrim.
"There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free people of Skyrim."
I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.
We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.
You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.
I consider even talking to the Empire a generous gesture.
Are you done? Did you just come here to make speeches? Or can we get down to business?
"Yes, let's get this over with."
We have nothing to say to each other. Paarthurnax's murder is beyond my powers of forgiveness.
"Yes. But understand - during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons were his allies. There was nothing else they could be."
"If not for Paarthurnax, Alduin could not have been overthrown. It was he that first taught men to use the Thu'um."
"I'd give a week's pay to see the look on Ulfric's face again, when he had to swallow the terms of the truce."
I hope this truce gives you what you need. It won't last.
"As soon as I get back to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready."
"When I return to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready to help trap this dragon."
The look on Tullius's face while the Greybeard read the terms was worth the trip.
I don't much like this truce. Feels like a betrayal to me.
We're counting on you to make this all worthwhile.
I sacrificed a lot here today for this plan of yours.
That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.
"You'd better be able to deliver, Dragonborn. I sacrificed a lot here today."
Is everyone here? Let's get this started.
"Don't worry, I'll come to this peace council of yours."
I never thought I'd ever willingly stand in the same room with Tullius again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.
It's good to be back in High Hrothgar after all these years.
I'd just as soon get this over with.
I'll come to your council. But I doubt any good will come of it.
When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?
I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time if you ask me.
I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.
Talking peace with Ulfric? You must be an optimist.
"You've done well, to even get the two of them in the same room."
"If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal."
"If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal."
We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.
What are we waiting for?
"We must make them see their danger, Dragonborn."
We must succeed here today.
And so we meet again. But this time I know who and what you really are.
I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the Blades is a choice you will come to regret.
I'm here to ensure that General Tullius does not exceed his authority.
You gave Ulfric more than he deserved. This will certainly prolong the war.
These terms are satisfactory to my government. The truce is unlikely to last long in any case.
I'm here because it's required of me. But there's nothing to be gained by talking to that murderer.
"I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for success."
I don't know why you gave Ulfric so much. That murderer will never rule Skyrim.
"I'm glad you were able to negotiate a truce, but I don't trust Ulfric. He'll break his word as soon as it suits him."
We should get started.
"You fight well, brother."
"You fight well, sister."
Argh!
Uf!
Yergh!
Egh!
Oof!
You must speak with the Farmhand at Chillfurrow farm.
"So you're the... the assassin? I need you to kill the Visiting Noble at Dragonsreach, in Whiterun. Here's the gold. I... I hope it's enough."
So you're the one from the... Dark Brotherhood? I need you to kill the Big Laborer at Katla's Farm. Here's the gold for the kill. Make it painful.
"You must be the... assassin. I need you to kill the Itinerant Lumberjack, in Morthal, at the logging camp. Here, this is all the gold I have."
"You're the assassin, right? Look, there's this Reckless Mage in the Frozen Hearth Inn, in Winterhold. I want him dead. This gold should cover it."
You're the one? From the... the Dark Brotherhood? The man I need killed is a Seasoned Hunter. He's just outside Falkreath. Here's the gold...
"You're here! I was wondering if that Black Sacrament even worked. I need you to kill a woman, a Poor Fishwife, on the Riften Docks. Here's the gold."
"Dark Brotherhood? You look the type. Listen, there's this Grim Shieldmaiden walking the streets of Markarth. Kill her. Now take this gold, and go."
"Are you the assassin? From the...? Well, there's this Traveling Dignitary, in Solitude. I need her... you know. This gold will cover it, right?"
"I'm glad you're here. I need you to kill a Coldhearted Gravedigger, tends to work in the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm. This is all the gold I have."
"Good, you're here. Look, in Ivarstead, there's this Beautiful Barbarian. I need her dead. Don't ask why. Just do it. This gold should cover it."
"If anybody asks, this meeting never took place."
I don't know you.
"Would it kill you to let a man go about his business in peace? Really, the nerve..."
"Look, I'm busy. Please go bother somebody else."
Did you want something? I'm quite busy.
"I'm dying for a rest. I swear, I could lie down right now, and just sleep forever."
The Dawnstar Sanctuary? That where you lot are holing up in now? Hmm... Tell you what. It'll cost you - a lot - but I can help you out.
What exactly are we talking about here?
"Tell me what you need, and I'll get my people get on it."
Of course you do.
All right. What's your fancy?
"I'm afraid that's it, my friend. I've done all I can. I hope the place is at least livable now. Good luck with, your, um... murders."
What... what happened?
"Thank you. I don't know what's going on, but I think I owe you my life."
"Sweet Breath of Arkay, were these the cannibals that were plaguing the Hall of the Dead?"
"I need to get back to Markarth. Here, take this. It's the least I can do for saving my life."
"Don't worry, Arkay's protection is absolute."
(yawn) I'm so tired...
Let me speak to our guest.
Don't be shy. You should be the one to carve.
This is your initiation into the coven. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
"Another new Apprentice, I see."
Are you of the sort that believe you're here to change the world? Or are you only in it for yourself?
I assure you that I shall be watching you -- all of you -- very closely.
I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations with your College.
I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires advice.
"Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim."
"To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future."
"Perhaps not as often as he should. In time, I believe he will be more trusting."
"Not within society, no. Many who practice within the school of Conjuration do so on their own, secretly."
"Falion is the only one I know who is public about what he does. He was once my teacher here, but left the College years ago."
"He didn't like the Arch-Mage. Hated dealing with him, hated having to answer to him."
"Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it."
"I understand he settled down in Hjaalmarch, and his presence there caused something of a problem."
"You are new, yes?"
Have you mastered the Expert level destruction spells yet?
You... you have? Already?
"Well, J'zargo is surprised. And pleased! There is real competition here. This is good."
"Ah, this is good. But J'zargo will know them first."
It is good to finally be around mages who may be able to keep up with J'zargo.
Is it? This is disappointing.
J'zargo hoped there might be one who could keep pace with his accomplishments.
"Oh, but you are wrong."
The only reason you could disagree is because you are losing so badly you cannot see it.
There is much for J'zargo to be sure of.
"There is skill in magic, there is charm, and there is a strong will. J'zargo will be successful, of this there is no doubt."
You've done it. The shrine is ours again.
Now we need to prepare a grand feast to welcome you to Namira's coven.
You will have the honor of bringing a fresh kill for the main course. And I know the perfect person.
"You are looking for Arkay's protection while you delve some dank tomb, I take it?"
My duties keep me busy in Markarth. I don't know if I can help you.
"Treasure, you say?"
I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a little while. Lead on.
"You know, in the Priesthood of Arkay, we have a joke about an empty pocket being better than a full grave."
"That's no small amount of coin, friend."
I suppose I can come with you for a short venture. Lead on.
"I'm just not up for it, sorry. I'd rather stay here, have a glass of wine, and perform my rites to Arkay in peace."
I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards.
"Yes, I'm positive I heard something."
Accidents' like this don't just happen! Someone is trying to sabotage my uncle's research!
I'll deal with my uncle. Just... go! Scour this place from top to bottom!
"Aedra, what a day!"
"I know you, Ulfric. You have no intention of coming to terms."
"You're here to blacken the Empire's name, and I won't be party to it."
You may think this war is nearly won. You're wrong. I've been fighting you with a mere handful of troops.
"Once the Emperor is convinced of the need, then you will see the full strength of the Imperial Legion."
"If you think you can hold Riften, you're as deluded as you've always been."
We get Riften back. Now we'll see if there's anything behind your fine words.
"I know how this works, Tullius. I've learned the value of Imperial promises the hard way. Never again."
You're losing this war and you know it.
"If you think that winning a few battles means you're winning the war, you're even worse at strategy than diplomacy."
You slaughtered the very people you claim to be fighting for! True sons of Skyrim would never do such things.
"Damned Imperial lies! My men would never stoop to such methods, even in retaliation for your butchery at..."
"This is our homeland, Tullius. All the blood spilled in this war is on your head."
Well said! You may be fighting on the wrong side in this war.
Well said.
I expected better from you.
I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair hearing.
I'm impressed at your even-handed treatment. Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.
What? Have you forgotten your oath to the Emperor?
"As I expected, you favor your friends."
Come see me in Windhelm when this is all done. There's always work for those willing to fight for Skyrim.
Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed Skyrim at every turn.
You... you disappointed me. You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.
I'm sure that will be a great comfort to the families of your comrades who died to free the land you just gave back to the Empire.
You should think harder on your commitment to Skyrim's freedom next time you're deciding what's right.
You made your decision. Now live with it.
"Very honorable, I'm sure, but you should not put your own honor above the freedom of Skyrim."
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a son of Skyrim.
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a daughter of Skyrim.
"Ulfric showed his true colors today, eh? Don't worry. You aren't the first to be taken in by his self-serving lies."
I think you may have joined the wrong side. You showed yourself to be a true friend to the Empire today.
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought you'd finally seen through Ulfric's lies.
"Excellent! You aren't the first to have a change of heart, after seeing what Ulfric's reckless pride is doing to Skyrim."
Come see me in Solitude when this is all done. The Emperor can always use another good soldier.
"Now, back to the matter at hand."
I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.
"If we're not going to get Riften, we need you to give us something."
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Markarth on these terms.
You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate this treaty and I would be recalled.
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These terms are still not acceptable.
"Come on, Ulfric. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both."
I'm listening.
Let's hear it.
"Out with it, then."
"Shor's bones, where will these demands end?"
Damn Imperial arrogance!
You see what talking to them gets us?
We want compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
We want compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
We want compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
We want compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
We want compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
We want compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
We want compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
We want compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
We want compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
We want compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
We want compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
We want compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
We want compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
We want compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
"We want Hjaalmarch back, and Idgrod Ravencrone restored as Jarl."
"You withdraw from Falkreath, and allow Siddgeir to resume his rightful place as Jarl."
We want the Pale returned to Imperial control. The traitor Skald the Elder will be replaced with a more loyal candidate.
"We want Kraldar removed as Jarl of Winterhold, and an Imperial candidate put in his place."
Never mind. I can see that these are the best terms we'll get from this council.
So be it. The Empire at least puts the greater good above our own interests.
"Why would I give you that, if I wouldn't give you Riften?"
"What next, Tullius? Shall I just hand over all of Skyrim?"
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn decide the fairness of my request.
I guess I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
"For what it's worth, I'm sorry to see you go. You fought well for us."
"Don't listen to him. Ulfric's been telling lies about himself for so long, he's actually starting to believe them."
"Jarl Baalgruf, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?"
"Well that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little detail, have you?"
Come on Galmar. We have a lot of work to do.
"This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And General Tullius. Riften is ours!"
"Giving up Markarth is a heavy price for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it."
"I admit, I really didn't expect you'd be able to arrange a truce. Getting Ulfric to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement."
"Yes, I'm ready to do my part."
"Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap."
Your man Horik is wearing his old Legion armor. What should I make of that?
"He's proud of his service, Skald. The Legion taught us loyalty. And we're loyal to Dawnstar."
"We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble."
Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work.
You'll never leave Markarth!
"You'll never see the sun again, you hear me? No one escapes Cidhna Mine."
No one.
"At last, the treasure is mine! All mine!"
"There must be a way to activate these doors deeper in the ruins. Here, take this key. It should open the doors on either side of this chamber."
There'd better be. I didn't come all this way to leave empty handed.
Hmm. These doors seem to be the only thing left between me and the treasure.
"I... oh, all right. If there is a thief, he won't leave this tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?"
"All right men, spread out and search the tower. No telling who- or what- we're dealing with here."
What a waste! There must be a dozen men up there!
Yeah. Calcelmo called in his entire expedition team- said he needed every man he could get to protect his research.
"Better them than us. We lost three good men to the traps up there, and for what- just to see another damn spider clanking around?"
"Well, at least this post is safe enough. Come on, let's get back to work."
"You heard me, captain- our work must not be disturbed."
Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one through.
"Sir, are you serious?"
"...As you say, sir."
What do you think this is?
"Another trap, most likely. Things are dangerous... three of the guards died when the lower hall flooded with steam last week."
What the...?
"Everyone, fall back! Run for it!"
"Oh thank you, kind stranger. Thank you for helping Cicero and his poor, stranded mother."
He he. That'll teach the little loony.
A jester. In these parts. Man must be completely off his tree.
"Move along, now."
You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?
Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law!
"You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue."
"Damn that Loreius. Oh, how he will pay for this treachery..."
"Listener! Is that you? Oh, I knew you'd come. Send the best to defeat the best. Astrid knew her stupid wolf couldn't slay sly Cicero."
"Oh, but this isn't at all what Mother would want. You kill the Keeper or I kill the Listener? Now that's madness."
"Ouch! Pointy pointy! My home is well defended. I always have been a stickler for details. Get it? [QUOTE]Stick-ler.[QUOTE] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I slay me!"
"You're... still alive. Cicero respects the Listener's abilities, of course, but could you at least slow down a bit? I'm not what I used to be. Heh."
"All right, so Cicero attacked that harlot, Astrid! But what's a fool to do, when his mother is slandered and mocked? Surely the Listener understands!"
"Brrr! Chilly! You'll enjoy this. Not an original part of the Sanctuary, per se. Let's call it a [QUOTE]forced addition.[QUOTE] Forced by what? Oh, come and see!"
"Cicero admits, he thought the Listener would be dead by now. Heh. Maybe we could just forget all this? Hmm? Let bygones be bygones? What do you say?"
"If it's any comfort, I do feel slightly bad about Veezara. Stupid lizard got in my way! But please tell me that hulking sheepdog has bled to death."
And now we come to the end of our play. The grand finale.
Our terms are simple.
Riften must be returned to Imperial control. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
"Elisif, are you really going to be a party to this foolishness?"
Do you really think Ulfric will just turn Riften over because some Imperial general barked an order?
"That's quite an opening demand, Tullius."
I'm sure General Tullius does not expect something for nothing.
"Of course not! What will you offer for Riften, Tullius? Some empty promises? Maybe some more Imperial bluster?"
"Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it."
"Come on, Tullius, you can't seriously expect us to just hand over Riften at the negotiating table."
You haven't been able to take it back yet. Why should we give it up now?
"Jarl Ulfric, what would you want in return?"
"First, let me be clear. The sons of Skyrim know from bitter experience that talking to the Empire is a waste of time, or worse."
Imperial promises are simply a way to lull you while they prepare a dagger for your back.
"But I accepted the Dragonborn's invitation to this council, and I at least will negotiate in good faith."
"Aye! We haven't forgotten Markarth, Tullius!"
"You heard the man, Tullius."
"You heard what she said, Tullius."
Riften is off the table. The Empire barely has a toehold left in Skyrim. We don't need to pay such a high price for this truce.
"We've made you a fair offer. If you're really serious about this truce, you need to reconsider."
Have you killed them all yet?
"Well, hurry up."
Then we've no time to lose. Follow me!
Don't fall behind!
"So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace."
I should not have agreed to host this council. The Greybeards have no business involving ourselves in such matters.
"Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting."
They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? [QUOTE]Season unending[QUOTE]... so it has proved.
"Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this... violation of all our traditions."
But regrets are pointless. Here we are.
Take your seat at the council table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of Skyrim.
You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.
We consider even sitting down to talk with these rebels more than generous.
We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
"Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to..."
Galmar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
Vignar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
"Yes, my lord."
"Enough, Galmar."
It has its advantages. I've never liked having the Empire perched on my doorstep. And Riften would be easy to hold...
"Yes. With Markarth in our hands, we'll be able to raid the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude..."
You're right. Tullius isn't in any position to ask for Riften.
"In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly."
Whiterun seems like a better choice to me. From there we can threaten to undermine the whole Imperial position.
"In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly. How about the Reach? Gaining control of the silver mines would be invaluable."
I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.
Well. Good! You favor the Empire less than I feared. Maybe we will be able to come to some agreement here after all.
Not enough to outweigh the loss of Riften. The whole south of Eastmarch would be open to Imperial attack.
You can't just leave me here!
Fie. We beseech you. Darken this gem so that we may use its power to restore The Order of the Black Worm.
Grant us this power so that in your name we may vanquish our enemies.
Fie!
"Yeah, fie!"
The Order shall rise.
"So. Arngeir, is it? You know why we're here. Are you going to let us in or not?"
You were not invited here. You are not welcome here.
"We have as much right to be at this council as all of you. More, actually, since we were the ones that put the Dragonborn on this path."
"I know what path you set her on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most."
"I know what path you set him on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most."
We know what path you've set her on. But she has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
We know what path you've set him on. But he has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
Were you? The hubris of the Blades truly knows no bounds.
She did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
He did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
"For now. The Blades' memory is long, as you know."
"If it were up to you, the Dragonborn would sit dreaming on this mountain doing nothing!"
"Delphine, we're not here to rehearse old grudges."
The matter at hand is urgent. Alduin must be stopped. You wouldn't have called this council if you didn't agree.
We know a great deal about the situation and the threat that Alduin poses to us all. You need us here if you want this council to succeed.
Very well. You may enter.
Damn right we do.
"Don't play dumb, Tullius!"
"Tell him, Ulfric."
I just want to make clear that the only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
We have no need to negotiate when the rebels are so clearly losing the war.
"I have no authority to negotiate a permanent settlement, unless Ulfric is ready to sue for peace and turn himself over to Imperial justice."
"Enough posturing, Tullius. If you came to talk, let's get on with it."
We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.
One moment.
Here we go.
Fine. Let's get this over with.
"What is there to know? It's in the temple, you bring it out. You bring it to me, I pay you. Now get moving."
"You're... probably right. Just hurry, please. Who knows what those things are doing to her."
"Thank you, friend."
Father!
"Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?"
Of course not. My spirit remains strong.
My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?
I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother.
It's our honor to have you there.
This man is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
This woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
Of course.
"Please, lead on."
Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery West as soon as possible. That was Maven's part of the deal.
"She's put me in charge of keeping the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do."
"If you're in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know."
I knew the Greybeards would send you there if they thought you were Dragonborn. They're nothing if not predictable.
"When you showed up here, I knew you were the one the Greybeards sent, and not some Thalmor plant."
You should know. You got the map for me from Bleak Falls Barrow.
I should say so. I'd be careful in the future before you confront someone without all of the facts!
Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever.
"Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me."
I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed!
"When I heard what Sibbi did, I fled. Now you've found me, and you're going to tell him where I am."
It's nice to receive good news for a change. Did you recover anything else from the warehouse worth mentioning?
Results speak volumes over words and you've just proved it.
Did you happen to discover where the fetcher was getting his skooma from?
Then there's no time to lose. It won't take long for Sarthis's associates to learn of his death.
"The source of the poison must be destroyed once and for all, otherwise another dealer will simply take his place."
Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.
Then I want you to head out there immediately and eliminate all of them.
I can't afford to have another Sarthis blunder into Riften because they think we're too lazy to disrupt their pitiful operation.
Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.
Good. Report back to me when your task is complete.
Good. Make sure not one of them escapes alive.
"I can't say I'm happy with your decision. If you change your mind, let me know."
I'm very disappointed. I'd advise you to rethink that decision soon.
"Look, I don't think I should say. I mean, they could kill me!"
It's not worth dying over.
It's got nothing to do with the coin... this is my life we're talking about.
You can't threaten me any worse than they have!
Thank you.
"Okay, okay, I'll tell you."
I get my skooma from Sarthis Idren. He has some sort of a setup over at the Riften Warehouse.
You can't get inside though. They've kept that place locked up tight since the war began.
"If it wasn't for skooma, I'd already be on my way out of this horrible city."
All my gold... completely gone. Now I have to start over. I'll never use skooma again!
Although I suppose a little mead now and then would be harmless...
I overheard Bolli say that only the Jarl carries the key to the warehouse.
"When I meet Sarthis there, he's usually waiting for me outside with his bodyguard."
"Yes, I'm afraid we're aware of Sarthis's presence in the warehouse."
"Unfortunately, we're certain he has informants within the city guard. Every time we've made a move to arrest him, he's escaped."
"However, if you'd take care of this discreetly, you might be able to surprise him without warning."
"Ah yes, Sarthis... a thorn in my side for the last few years."
"I've tried repeatedly to eradicate that meddler, but he has ears within the city guard. Gives us the slip every time we raid the warehouse."
"However, if you'd wish to eliminate that burden for me... well, let's just say it would go a long way with earning my favor."
"Excellent. Here, this is the key to the warehouse."
See if you can drop in on this dealer of poison and convince him to close down his operation permanently.
"Good. Here, take the key to the warehouse."
"Pay dear old Sarthis a visit and tell him Maven sends her regards, would you?"
"Hm. Well, if you change your mind, come see me again."
Let me give you a word of advice.
Think about your choices carefully from now on. You'll go much farther in Riften with me on your side.
"Oh come now, this is mead... not some wine to be sipped and savored."
You... you're in charge here until I can sort this all out.
It will be my pleasure.
"Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!"
I said move!
"Farewell, Sabjorn."
Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn.
Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven and the Guild.
"Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way, go right ahead."
"Hold on, my boy. Hold on!"
"Hold on, my dear. Hold on!"
I thought it high time I caught up with you.
"I've never seen anything like this in Nordic ruins before. Why, just look at all these coffins!"
This bears closer inspection. I'd like to stay a while and examine this.
"You, however, should press on. See if you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is truly dangerous, be careful."
Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up with you before long.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
"Gods, it's cold. They'd better find something good in there to make this worthwhile."
"As long as the College keeps paying, I'll keep digging."
"For thousand-year old ruins, they're not much to look at."
Can't imagine what the College expects to find in here.
But why?
"This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely."
Ohh... but I will have your blood...
My thirst will be sated...
"Oh, I can smell your blood..."
You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead...
Tell you what. You start running so I can stab you in the back.
Can't wait to count out your coin...
You cannot even conceive of the power I wield...
"Fire, frost, or lightning - you will suffer at my hands!"
Don't you see? I am master of the arcane!
Come. Come and face the Forsworn...
First you... then all of the Reach!
The Forsworn will reclaim what is rightfully ours!
Soon you will know the cold of death...
The endless sleep comes for us all...
Eternal slumber awaits...
Foolish human. Your time is at its end!
Time for you humans to learn your place!
"Soon, all Nords will be thralls to the Thalmor!"
Nord beast! Both your life and lands are now forfeit!
"Behold, the future. Behold, the Thalmor!"
Ha ha ha ha ha! You wish to defeat me? Impossible.
Don't you see? Elven supremacy is the only truth!
Death is the only way out of your misery!
"You are but a dog, and I am your master!"
Ha! You can never truly stop me!
Ugh! Only a fool tries to kill the dead!
Agh! Pathetic mortal!
Never!
Agh!
Unh!
Oof!
Waaagh!
Naggh!
Unh!
Oof!
Noo...
I will return...
Aggghh...
Uggh...
Agggh!
Uggh...
Unnff...
I sense a presence...
Hmm? Does someone live among the dead?
Lookee here. Looks like we got ourselves a hero.
"You picked a bad time to get lost, friend."
Now ain't this a surprise.
Who dares disturb my rest?
You are not welcome here!
All the living shall fear the dead!
Mortal fool! No one hides from the dead!
Death comes for you now!
Nothing... Nothing...
The glimmer of life is gone...
Such an abrupt end to our game.
Finality.
You dare hide from me?
"I still sense your presence, living fool..."
Gone. The living are right to fear the dead.
There is no more life here.
"We meet again, mortal!"
Time to end your foolish charade!
...retire some day... get myself an island...
...never enough gold... just need one good haul...
...might pay off my bounty this time... walk into the city a free man...
"..told him to just hand over the gold, but did he listen? Oh, no... they always have to fight back..."

It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its pedestal.
That's about the truth of it. Write tales about the sights I've seen. The battles I've fought.
Earned quite a name for myself when I was younger. The Bards College still teaches some of my work to their students.
"It's a school that teaches music, poetry, that sort of thing. Most bards in Skyrim have been to the college at some point."
"If you're thinking of applying, talk to Viarmo in Solitude."
"Beirand's my husband. He works the forge up at Castle Dour. I barely see him nowadays, what with him filling orders for the army."
My husband. He was the blacksmith up at Castle Dour.
"Ah... To be honest, no. But High King Torygg supported them, and now her lady Elisif has thrown in with them."
You could say I'm a King's man at heart. Hmph. I guess that's [QUOTE]Jarl's man[QUOTE] now.
"My loyalty lies with Solitude. So where Jarl Elisif leads, I follow."
"Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should see what we have available."
"Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should come by our shop. Radiant Raiment."
We could fix you right up.
I do. So few people possess the taste and sophistication of a proper wardrobe these days.
"Be sure and investigate Radiant Raiment's fine selection of clothing. We have many items you'll fancy, I'm sure."
"I suppose I would, but you're the only one who gets that greeting."
It's never been an issue. People say you helped with the problems at Wolfskull Cave.
I applaud anyone who assists the court.
"Oh, we do all right. Rumor is, you had a hand in the Blackblood Marauders' demise..."
I'm impressed.
Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we...
"Wait. You're that new bard, the one who saved the Festival. Aren't you?"
That was a good bit of work.
Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we get business.
"Well, as it turns out, I had a pet skeever when I was a boy and he used to wink."
"Down at the docks. There are a few good spots, if you can avoid the East Empire Company workers and those Red Wave thugs."
"Not much. But as a bard, I find the whole affair depressing."
There are no heroes in this war. No winners to be had and no real conclusion.
"Not much. But as a bard, I find the whole affair depressing."
"There are no heroes in this war. Even with Ulfric here in Solitude, there are no winners to be had. No real conclusion."
"They're... adequate. Honestly, I rely on the business brought in by the Burning of King Olaf, and that's not likely to happen this year."
"Oh, very brisk. When the snow sets in, even the hardiest Nord needs some spiced wine to warm the blood."
"I have my ways, but it's not easy these days."
The Blackblood Marauders have been plundering ships off the coast. A lot of people been hurt by their foolishness.
It's been easier lately.
"The Blackblood Marauders haven't been seen since the Icerunner attack, so my shipments have been more regular."
"No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title."
"Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line."
It seems I will never take my rightful place as High Queen.
"Not yet, no. Although it is true my husband Torygg was the High King, and I am his widow... now is not the time to lay claim to such a title."
"This land is riven by war, and her people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged."
Only then will I take my rightful place as High Queen.
I was a member of the court during the reign of Torygg's father. It was Torygg who appointed me to the position.
Please. You're in the presence of a born huntsman. I can hear the sweat sliding down your forehead.
Ha! I like you.
No man is a match for a dragon.
"Buying one of our blades wouldn't hurt your chances, though."
They were smaller back then.
I thought so.
"Did you see a hound on the road? A fine, strong creature that's been wandering near town."
"Fruit, fresh off the boat! The freshest in Skyrim!"
Get your fresh fruit and produce here!
"Apples, tomatoes, leeks and cabbages! Fresh and ripe!"
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!
Fresh Fish! Straight from the Fjords!
"The finest fish, here! Caught daily!"
Spiced Wine to warm the blood!
Keep the cold at bay with our spiced wine!
"Spiced wine, the taste of home and hearth!"
"Come on, now! I want those arrows dead center! The lives of your fellow soldiers are counting on it."
Concentrate. The battlefield is full of distractions. Ignore them! Focus on your targets.
"Some day soon, you will all see battle. And what you do here, today, may well save your lives!"
"You won't get anything out of me, you filthy sons o' horkers."
I stand with the Stormcloaks. You Imperial dogs will never break my will. Never!
"I've got weapons for givin', and armor for gettin'!"
Arms and armor! Forged by a master craftsman!
A coin or two for a veteran? It's not much to ask...
You know you can afford a septim or two.
Let us walk in the steps of the Divines.
"Remind us of our place, when we forget."
May knowledge of your Divinity carry us through our daily trials.
"I showed up to watch, yeah."
"I don't know if they were right to execute him for what he did, but I'll tell you something..."
It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
"Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!"
"He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything."
My brother was the best man in Solitude.
"I'm a Thane. In the future, you may want to gain that information before talking with someone. Risk of looking like an idiot, and all that."
Yes. My older brother and the person you probably want to be speaking to right now.
"But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop."
"Yes. My older brother. He was a bit of a fop, really."
"And truth be told, since Torygg's death, he had no real power in court. But still... He didn't deserve to die."
I make sure Erikur keeps breathing.
I provide my wisdom and insight to the court.
"It does indeed. You know, I hear you had something to do with Sybille Stentor's demise..."
"That must have been a hard bit of business. I hear Stentor had been alive for a long, long time."
"Aye, but I'll be here in Solitude for longer still. Fihada's skill as a fletcher drew me to this place. I wanted to learn."
"And there is still much of Skyrim I wish to see. I hear there is a city, Wind-Helm, that is nearly white with... What do you call it? Ah yes! Snow."
"And far to the west lies a ruin. Volskygge. Inside, there is said to be a wall, black as night. And it speaks! In the ancient Dragon tongue!"
There are wonders in this place I never dreamed imaginable.
"What? You see a man fallen on hard times, and you think he's been like that forever?"
"I was there. I fought in the Great War. I was on the field at Anvil. And when I was struck down, they left me."
You understand? They left me for dead. I didn't leave them.
"I shouldn't be. Mama says if I do, people are going to ask about uncle Roggvir."
"Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either."
I shouldn't be. Everyone wants to ask me about mama and uncle Roggvir.
"Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either."
"And why wouldn't I be? We sing tales of kings, queens and their politics, 'tis true. But do you know who really makes history?"
The person who writes it.
Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons but Inge... Dean Six Fingers... says I'm quite good with the flute.
Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons. Dean Six Fingers used to say I was quite good with the flute.
Aye. I'm the headsman here in Solitude. It's my job.
"She still mourns greatly for her husband, High King Torygg. So she leaves many of the courtly details to me."
"All my life. I practically grew up in the Hall. My father and mother were the priest and priestess of Arkay before me, you see."
I believe I was put here to protect this place from the darkness that pervades Solitude.
"Their aim could be steadier, but they're battle ready."
"Perhaps, but necessary. As you know my cousin, Fura, died out there fighting for us. She wouldn't have had to, if it weren't for Roggvir."
"Perhaps, but necessary. My cousin, Fura, is somewhere out there in Skyrim right now, fighting Ulfric Stormcloak and his damned insurrectionists."
"She wouldn't have to be there at all, if it weren't for Roggvir."
"No, no. Mostly, I'm just a simple herbalist. Lami over in Morthal should be able to help you."
"No, no. I'm just a simple herbalist. You'll want to see Arcadia, over in Whiterun."
"Oh, master. It's your time to do with as you please, but what about those who depend on you so much?"
"Tendrils of thought may wind their way through this realm, but those tendrils bind our reality together."
A method to your madness and your madness is the method and the melody...
I found the bone! I've brought it to you but still I am refused...
"Before we begin, I want to make two things perfectly clear."
"One, I'm the best infiltrator this rathole of a Guild's got, so if you think you're here to replace me, you're dead wrong."
"And two, you follow my lead and do exactly as I say... no questions, no excuses."
Then we understand each other... good.
"Now, it's time to get your feet wet and I don't want to waste a lot of time talking about anything but business."
"Easy, huh? So, should I just hand you purses of coin or are you going to work to earn your keep?"
"Let me give you a small bit of advice. Nothing in this line of work is easy. If it was, every dreg in the Ratway would be robbing Riften blind."
"If something's being handed to you on a silver platter, then there's a catch... steal the platter instead. You get it?"
Now you I like. I've been getting sick of the pushovers that usually walk in here.
I think you and I are going to get along just fine.
"Now, it's time to get your feet wet and I don't want to waste a lot of time talking about anything but business."
I'm not going to sugar-coat it for you. We're in a bad way down here.
Who knows. Old Delvin thinks it's some kind of a curse. I think he's crazy.
If you want my opinion I say it's just plain old bad luck.
You can get out there and start making a name for us again... make them start fearing us like they did long ago.
"And, while you're at it, make a little bit of coin on the side. Not a bad deal, eh?"
"Brynjolf, huh? Lemme guess. He plucked you off the street and dropped you into the thick of things without tellin' you which way is up. Am I right?"
"Lyin' to my face isn't gonna win you any favors with me, I can promise you that."
"On the other hand, takin' some of these extra jobs off my hands, now that'll get you to the top of my list."
"See, that kind of attitude comes from someone who wants to get rich and stay alive long enough to enjoy it. We're goin' to get along nicely."
"So, if you've got the nerve, I've got plenty of extra jobs to help get the Guild back on its feet."
"Look around you. The Flagon, the Guild... it's all fallin' apart."
"A few decades ago, this place was as busy as the Imperial City. Now, you're lucky if you don't trip over a skeever instead."
"Look, I know the others think I'm a bit daft for sayin' stuff like this, but I'm gonna give it to you straight."
"Somethin' out there is piss-drunk mad at us. I don't know who or what it is, but it's beyond just you and me. We've been cursed."
I'll tell you what we do. We spit in that curse's face and turn things around down here. Put things back the way they were.
That's where you come in. I've got plenty of work available that could guide us down the road to recovery.
All you need to do is ask and we can both come out of this smellin' like a rose.
"Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me."
"Welcome to the family, lass. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me."
Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing.
You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way.
"Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon... she'll set you up with your new armor."
"The Skyforge? Aye, my clan-fathers have worked it since the first Gray-Manes came to Whiterun."
"Skyforge Steel is all the Companions will use, for good reason."
Why? Who says I have to be?
"Skyforge Steel is my art and honor. The Companions need the best, so they come to me."
"Battle-Born is a name out of legend, sung in the songs of old and heard in deeds of valor for a hundred generations."
[QUOTE]For Clan Battle-Born![QUOTE] they cry in the mead halls. [QUOTE]First into the fray and last to quit their ale![QUOTE]
"We've got honor. Wealth and titles, too. Aye, and buxom women to warm your bed on a cold Skyrim night."
"Now if that don't answer your question, then no words will."
"Uncivilized, pelt-wearing axe-draggers. It's a wonder they don't still live in a cave like those ancestors they keep boasting about."
"It's true the Vignar Gray-Mane and his lot are one of Whiterun's oldest and, depending on who you ask, most respected clans. I don't dispute that."
"But it's one thing to take pride in your lineage, and another to cling blindly to the past. What they call honor and tradition, I call ignorance."
"Money, you laggard! What else? It always comes down to coin."
"The Gray-Manes have deep roots in Whiterun, but so do we. Difference is, we're rich, and Vignar hates it."
"Oh, and they hate it, too. All their big talk of pride and honor, and what have they got to show for it? Beggar's rags and stale bread."
"We've got the same pride, the same honor, and we've got wealth. No wonder they envy us."
"Peryite, heed our call if you deem us worthy. Our leader, Orchendor, has led us here and for that we are thankful."
"He has shown us that our suffering is not a punishment, but a blessing."
"Yes, a blessing. For many months we have sought your guidance, yet we have heard nothing from you."
"If we do not please you, give us a sign so that we may understand why."
"Yes, a sign. We are lost without your guidance."
"On the ninth of Rain's Hand our prayers went unanswered, yet here we stand, not faltering in our belief that soon you will show yourself to us."
"Yes, show yourself to us. Until that day, we will continue to devote our lives to you and suffer for you."
"Yes, suffer for you."
Keep your eyes and ears open my Brothers and Sisters.  Orchendor needs us to keep vigilant while he convenes with Peryite in the Arcanex.
"I'm sorry to wake you, my Brother. I have a request from Orchendor."
"Yes, what is it?"
He requests more barrels of ichor to be delivered to the Arcanex tomorrow.
This is the reason you wake me? I already have Orchendor's request taken care of.
I'm sorry my Brother.
Now leave me to my sleep. My strength and patience are waning.
"Yes, my Brother. Forgive me. May the blessing of Peryite be with you."
"Yes, yes, as with you. Now be off."
Are you asleep?
"I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become."
We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it?
Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of.
He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering.
"Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence."
I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker.
"But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises."
I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor.
Ah ha! So you're a student of theoretical applied harmonics!
"Putting aside Ralston's Constant of Universal Inversion for a moment, how would you approach the problem?"
Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent or allow it to generate its own field?
Seven. Astonishing. I hadn't considered that.
"I mean, it would take months... years to work out the differentials. But what a revolutionary concept."
"Wait, wait. I can see a minor problem in your theory. Without a soul siphon, how would you prevent permanent magicka burn?"
The blue thing? But even the simplest harmonic field is composed of entirely...
"Wait just a moment. The blue thing. Yes, yes, yes! I can see your point. Draw out the necessary energies using a Jarol Apparatus!"
But wait. What about soul reversal? You must be aware of the consequences when using the apparatus near an open magic field.
"Calipers? That's utterly ridiculous. Maybe long ago, you could just find calipers in every household across Tamriel, but not anymore."
"Hold on, you've given me a brilliant idea. Just as calipers hold materials in place, a soul siphon can hold magic fields in place."
"Genius! And I'm sure you've completely worked out how to counteract complete dimensional collapse, right?"
"Of course! Nine is the most basic of magical principles. Oh, how stupid of me."
"That completely takes care of all your basic problems, magicka burn, dimensional collapse and thermic drift!"
"You've done it! Now, if I can only remember what we were originally talking about."
Are you completely insane? Swallow a soul gem?
That has to be the most brilliant and unexpected solution I've heard in a long time. It solves all of my problems and keeps the field stable!
"Now all I need... wait, what were we talking about?"
"It was Aerin who found me dying outside of a Dwemer ruin. If he hadn't brought me here and nursed me back to health, I would have died."
"When my strength returned and he told me about the problems plaguing Riften, I decided fate brought me here for a reason... so I stayed."
"You know, I'm beginning to respect you. Other than Aerin, you seem to be the only other person I've met I might be able to trust."
"Since we share the same opinion of them, let me warn you that they're recruiting others to join their [QUOTE]guild[QUOTE] and you should be cautious."
That's a shame. Too many people in Riften share your view and look where its getting them.
It's going to take more than just myself and Aerin to help this city... it has to want to help itself first.
"You disappoint me. I expected someone from outside Riften to be different, but I see corruption's reach holds little regard for boundaries."
Enjoy the city. It will suit you well.
"You will find him holed up at Knifepoint Ridge, where he plays king to bandits and highwaymen."
"For a time he served his purpose, but that time has ended. He uses my gifts for his own amusement, and the only amusement I tolerate is my own."
"Kill every single member of his band. Do so as silently and invisibly as you can, for this is not about you. You are to be my instrument in this."
Slay him in the coldest of blood. Do not give him the dignity of defending himself.
"Once his corpse lays cold upon the ground, and all trace of his followers erased, retrieve my Ebony Mail. A gift fit only for my true champion."
"Oh, yes. J'zargo hopes to find things that will make him a more powerful mage here."
"Hopefully small things that fit inside pockets, and will not be noticed if they are missing."
Because Tolfdir says so. He says there are things to learn here.
"Hopefully we can learn something from the experience. How the ancient Nords used magic, maybe even what happened to this place."
"Not really. Just that it's very, very old. It was one of the first cities of men in Tamriel, I think."
Certainly! It's a fine tune and a good request!
"You can try, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly."
You're telling me.
Ainethach needs to get rid of those Silver-Blood. Then maybe we can go back to work.
You should talk to Ainethach. He runs the mines. Used to anyway.
You should talk to Ainethach if you have business with the mine. Not that there's much these days.
"Forsworn attacks are bad enough, but those sellswords are worse."
Do that and I'll make sure you get a cut.
Right.
"You're right. They always get what they want, somehow. Fine. Tell Atar I'll sell."
Someone has to stand up to them. I won't sell.
That's more gold than they're offering. Fine. I'll sell.
This isn't about the money.
Easy. I'll sell. Just don't hurt anyone.
Let's do that.
Dealing with a mob wouldn't be good for my coin purse. Fine. We're leaving.
Let's see them make us.
"That I will, stranger. This is more than the Silver-Bloods are paying us. We'll clear out."
Don't think I'm being paid already? Get lost.
Whoa. Wait a second. I was just kidding. We'll leave. We'll leave!
I thought today was going to be boring.
Milk drinker.
"Good work. Here's your cut. I guess this finishes up our contract with the Silver-Bloods, so we'll be heading out."
My family has owned Karthwasten for generations. Rare for anyone in the Reach that isn't a Nord.
Not that it does me any good. Nords think I'm working for the Forsworn. Forsworn think I'm working for the Nords.
I'm not from here. I'm a sellsword. These are my men.
And now you have it. No harm done.
I knew the Greybeards would send you for the horn if they thought you were Dragonborn.
Taking it was the only way I could be sure this wasn't a Thalmor trap.
"Yes. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning."
But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.
"The Thalmor. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning."
But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.
Something's happening to bring the dragons back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
The Thalmor happened. They've been hunting down every Blade they can find for the past thirty years.
"Thanks to the White-Gold Concordat, they've been able to operate throughout the Empire with impunity."
Part of the cost of peace. Emperor Titus Mede saved his Empire at a very high price. A price that included the Blades.
"The Nords didn't like the peace treaty much either. Thirty years later, the Empire ends up with the Stormcloak rebellion on its hands."
No doubt exactly as the Thalmor intended.
The Blades have always guarded and guided the Dragonborn. But we'd forgotten why.
"Now our purpose is clear. I'm all that's left of the Blades, and you're the Dragonborn."
"Together we're going to stop these dragons, if we have to put every last one of them back in the ground."
"Dragons are coming back, and you're a born dragonslayer. That's all you need to know right now."
Is there someone out there?
"You have to help me, they are going to kill me!"
We offer this soul to The Revenant: he who watches over the opponents of Arkay and his power over life and death. Fie upon Arkay and his followers!
No.
There's no chance anyone in authority approved this.
Our ancestors should be allowed to rest in peace.
"Why? Because it's old, and full of dead things?"
Clearly you've never spent any time in Morrowind.
Did he now?
Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?
Is that the one about something buried beneath Saarthal? Something that men and mer fought over?
I'll have to make a point of re-reading it. I don't recall the details.
"Ah, yes. Well, I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later."
"I just can't seem to tear myself away. Whatever this is, its beauty is like nothing I've ever seen before."
"If you'd allow me to indulge myself for a moment, I thought I might make a few observations..."
"This marvelous object. It practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt before."
"Oh, I think you dropped this. Some kind of note. Looks important."
You want answers? Well so do I. So does everyone in this city.
A man goes crazy in the market. Everyone knows he's a Forsworn agent. Guards do nothing. Nothing but clean up the mess.
"Ah, yes. You've proven to be a real bloodhound. Well, you've sniffed me out."
I've been playing this game for almost 20 years. Sending the young to their deaths. All in the name of the Forsworn. And I'm tired. So tired.
"This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial. Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion."
"There's a fine line between respect and boot-licking, new blood. But I like your spirit."
"We've decided this will be your Trial. Do well, and you'll be counted among the Companions."
Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he cut through the elven hordes that once swarmed this land.
He made it safe for our kind.
Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he came back from Atmora.
An axe of great vengeance. Each fragment is precious.
Lead the way.
You've come. The draugr infesting Namira's sanctuary are inside.
Clear Namira's sanctuary of the undead.
"Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of mortals, their crafts and their hearts."
"If they love me not, how can my love reach them?"
"Restore to me my beacon, that I might guide you toward your destiny."
A new supplicant approaches.
Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy.
Return my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.
And I will make you the instrument of my cleansing light.
"But first, you must restore to me my beacon."
I shall guide you unto it. Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward.
I was hoping you would say that.
Then I'll wait.
"You were young when you first tasted human flesh, weren't you? A brother or sister had died? An accident, of course."
Then the hunger set in. Curiosity. What's the harm in just one bite?
"It's okay, now. You've found a friend who understands you. You can let go of your guilt."
"It's inside Reachcliff Cave. But the dead have stirred from their slumber recently, and I was forced here."
Meet me there. We will fight our way to Namira's embrace together.
"Until then, tell the people of Markarth that their dead won't be disturbed, anymore. We have bigger plans ahead."
"Very well. But should the hunger call out to you, I'll be waiting outside Reachcliff Cave."
Tell the people of Markarth that their dead are safe. My work is done here.
"Divines preserve you, you're a hero. We'll re-open the Hall right away."
Here. Take my amulet as a reward.
"No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn to give it to us."
"The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what I mean?"
Silent means I don't tell and it's none of your business.
I don't think that could have gone any better.
Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?
Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you to get in there and get it done.
Now get going before Sabjorn grows a brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.
"If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for life."
"Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in jail, she's going to take over his meadery."
And guess who gets to run the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.
"So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh?"
You're welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his papers stashed in his desk.
"Here, this should help."
You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I suppose you can wait around if you must.
Have you lost your mind? I thought it was clear I didn't want anyone killed.
Now I have to spend a fortune to keep the whole thing quiet. Guess where that money comes from.
This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.
"Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me."
You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.
"Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me."
You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.
There's also the matter of your payment. I believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.
Look out! The wolf is loose!
You think it'll work?
Course not. Dogs I could train. But a half-starved wolf? Not a chance.
Right. Lucky if it doesn't rip our throats out.
"So, you in?"
"...Yeah. We can't have that rheumy-eyed fool as our watchman, even if he is Hajvarr's uncle. Time we dealt with both of them."
"We strike tonight, at dusk. Be ready."
"Eh? Who's there? Rodulf, that you?"
Good luck out there.
"I have need of a warrior. Only the most ruthless, cunning, and agile will do."
"You have gathered here night after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly with yourselves."
But which among you truly exceeds the rest?
Prove yourselves to me!
I have a special task for whichever of you is left standing.
Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb.
"If the owner cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the picture... which she can't afford."
"If I was Maven, I'd blame the Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place."
"Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support."
This Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.
I'm so sorry. I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future.
"The Forsworn? Strange. Well, I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future, for what it's worth."
"I'm sorry to drag you into Markarth's problems, but after that attack in the market, I'm running out of time."
You're an outsider. You're dangerous-looking. You'll do.
Changed your mind? Ready to find out the truth about Markarth?
Found another one of those vents in back near the scaffold.
Does Dravynea know?
She hasn't had a chance to look at it yet. Just be careful over there.
Always.
Sweltering in here.
"I'd like the fresh air better, but this isn't so bad."
How do you stay cheery down in these blazes?
I don't know. Maybe because it makes the mead taste that much better at night.
Again with the mead!
You going to be at the inn tonight?
Not sure. Feeling like taking another trip.
What's your wife think of your trips?
"They're none of her business, and none of yours either."
What did I tell you about snooping around my wards?
"Woman, there's a vein of malachite as thick as my leg back there."
"And if you don't let me secure the steam channel, your leg could get blown off."
So go dig at the other corner for a bit.
Well... just get it done.
Roggi tell you about the scorcher we found under the scaffolding?
Again? But there shouldn't be any earthstreams over there.
Well I nearly lost my eyebrows to it.
"All right, I'll take a look at it."
Is the new shaft cleared yet?
"No, I've been busy trying to keep the whole mine from collapsing, if that's all right with you."
You're busy. I'll come back later.
Kjeld bothering you again?
Nothing I can't handle.
"Well, you send that blowhard to me if he steps over the line."
How's the mine today?
Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.
As usual. I've always got an eye on the rocks.
What?
Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there?
That can't be a coincidence.
The Arch-Mage.
Wo meyz wah dii vul junaar?
Nivahriin muz fent siiv nid aaz het.
You do not answer... Must I use this guttural language of yours?
"Have you returned, Aren? My old friend?"
Do you seek to finish that which you could not?
You only face failure once more...
"You... You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place?"
Did he warn you that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?
Come. Face your end.
So you're interested in my potions and ingredients?
Got a pretty full stock of potions and alchemy reagents.
"Ah, so you're an alchemist, then?"
The finest weapons and armor.
"Hmm... Blades, helmets. Pretty much anything to suit your needs."
"Looking to protect yourself, or deal some damage?"
Usual guild rate. Let's take a look at them.
Why don't you take a look at some of my merchandise and we'll see what kind of a deal we can make.
I've got coin and I've got merchandise. Let's see what we can do.
I give special rates to members of the Thieves Guild. Show me what you've got.
Bow and arrows for the mighty huntsman.
"An archer, eh? Oh, I've got just what you need."
What are you hunting? Never mind. I don't want to know.
"Drink for the thirsty, food for the hungry."
"Let's sate that appetite, hmm?"
"Depends. Are you thirsty, hungry, both?"
Beautiful things for beautiful people.
Let see what adornments I might have available...
I've got some wonderful jewelry.
"Oh, a bit of this and a bit of that."
"Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing."
"Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures."
Just what you see here.
"Everything I've got on display, really."
See for yourself.
Spells and incantations for those with the talent to cast them.
"So, you wish to master the arcane arts..."
Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you'll appreciate this...
Clothes and raiment for the discerning customer.
"Breeches, gowns... clothes for any occasion, really."
Let's see if we can't find an outfit that suits you.
Take a look.
We've failed. The city is lost. They're through the gates and will be here soon.
The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They always make such easy prey.
"Old fort. Abandoned for years. They're like jackals, making their home anywhere they can find."
"You there. We are looking for someone in Whiterun, and will pay good money for information."
"So, what book should I read to you tonight?"
How about [QUOTE]The Lusty Argonian Maid[QUOTE]?
Mother!
"You've got no sense of humor, you know that? Why don't you pick up where you left off with [QUOTE]The Real Barenziah.[QUOTE]"
"Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day."
"That's all right, grandmother. I like staying home with you."
"It's that Braith girl again, isn't it? Has she been bothering you again? I've a mind to speak with her mother."
"No! Please, grandmother, don't do that. I'm fine. Really. Can we just... not talk about this anymore?"
"All right, dear."
"When will you be makin' some more jewelry, love? Some silver lockets and amulets would fetch a nice price at the stand."
Hrm.
"Wonderful, dear. Thank you."
Hrm.
"Eorlund, dearest, are you hungry? Would you like me to fix you something?"
Hrm.
"A venison pie, maybe? With a nice cup of mulled mead?"
Hrm.
"Oh, I didn't see you there."
"Of course I'm troubled. I'm on the verge of incredible wealth, but my cowardly work force ran at the first sign of danger."
"We were excavating this old tomb when we opened a chamber full of corpses. The team took one look, turned tail, and ran."
"Well, probably not like these. The ones in there are all still walking around."
"In any case, if I can't get past the creatures in that room, I can't recover the treasure. I need more manpower."
"Say, that's not a bad idea. You look like you could handle yourself against these beasts."
I'll tell you what. You help me get the treasure and I'll split it with you. Deal?
"Legend says this tomb holds a treasure that bestows great power on the one who discovers it. Beyond that, not much more is known."
"Obviously, this treasure will fetch a good deal of gold, and I'm willing to let you share in the reward when we find it."
"Excellent. With my brains and your brawn, that treasure will soon be mine... uh, ours."
Bah! You're just as bad as the rest of them.
"Bear in mind, even if you clear out the tomb, you'll still need a key to get to the treasure. A key I happen to possess."
"First, I need you to clear the main chamber of those monstrosities. I'll stay here until you're finished, planning our next move."
"You shoe that gelding, boy?"
"Yes, father."
"Groom her, too?"
You know I did.
You clean out that muck?
"Yes, father, I did. And I watered her, and got fresh feed, and refitted the old saddle, just like you asked. Is there anything else?"
Don't suppose there is. But you don't have to be so damned prickly.
"I tell you? Saw that wild mare again yesterday, just outside the walls."
Yeah. So?
So? So?
"Shor's beard, boy! You forget where you're standing? What kind o' business we're running?"
"We manage to break that mare and bring her back here, we can sell her for a small fortune."
Oh. Okay. So we should try to... what? Capture it?
"Yes, son. We should try to capture it."
"Listen, father. I've been thinking...."
"Here it comes again. Not happy with a roof and a trade, no. You want to be something entirely... different."
"I'm just no good at this. You said it yourself. Gods, I don't even like horses. And if it's true what they're saying about dragons..."
Dragons? You want to go out and fight dragons? Are you completely off your nut?
"Come on, father, how hard can it be? They're just... big lizards. And those scales and teeth, they must be worth a fortune..."
"Big lizards? By Shor, your mother gave birth to a half-wit. That is the end of this discussion."
"Hello, Fralia dear."
"Lillith - always a pleasure. Just browsing, or were you looking for something particular?"
"Funny you should ask. I'm in the market for a new locket. Something in polished silver, maybe. Big enough to hold, say, a folded-up letter?"
"Ahhh, I see. I think I know just what you need. I don't have anything like that here now, but my Eorlund - he can make you one right quick."
"When I get home, I'll have him start on it right away. Come back to pick it up in, oh... three days?"
"Perfect, my dear. Absolutely perfect. I'll see you then."
Do you have anything even remotely fresh?
"I can assure you, it's all fresh. I hunt the game myself, every day."
Hmm. As you say.
Maybe you'd like to try the horker? Or some beef?
"You don't prepare the meat with any of those strange Elven spices, do you?"
"Ahhhh... No, no Elven spices. Just some salt, to preserve it. You're not afraid of salt, are you?"
"I'm not [QUOTE]afraid[QUOTE] of anything. I simply prefer quality merchandise. No, no this meat won't do at all. Too much fat, and it all smells... wrong."
"Suit yourself, then. The woods are that way. Outside the walls, walk straight ahead. Can't miss them. Good luck on your hunt."
Good day.
"Can you close up the stand early today, mama?"
"I'm afraid not, little fairy. The fruit has about another day left before it spoils. We've got to sell as much as we can, as soon as we can."
That's what you always say.
Because it's always true.
Can we at least go to the tavern for supper?
"Tsk. And to think, I was going to feed you cabbages and apples again. Yes, little fairy, we can go to the tavern for supper."
Yay!
And what might you be looking at?
"Oh, the fruit looks so good. So juicy."
"No handouts today, Brenuin. Now scat. You'll scare off my paying customers."
"Oh, just one apple, Carlotta? Just one tiny apple. I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear it."
"That's what you said last week, and the week before that. Now go, before I call a guard."
"No, no! Don't do that. No need to do that. I'm going. See? I'm leaving. No guards, please."
"Look, come back tomorrow, okay? If I have anything left that's not sold or spoiled, you can have it."
"You've got the heart of Mara herself, you know that? Thank you, Carlotta. Thank you."
"Everyone is this city is so on edge. I could use some good news, Skulvar."
Ha! Four more geldings sold. Sound like good news to you?
Indeed.
"I do hate to admit it, but if nothing else, all the fighting lately has been a complete blessing to this business."
"Aye, that it has. Trust me, mum - once you've killed a man from a horse, you'll never want to fight on the ground again. Ain't no goin' back."
"Why thank you for that most colorful assessment, Skulvar."
"So we'll be needing fresh horses, then?"
"Aye, mum. That we will. Mares, stallions, donkeys - I don't think it matters. Pretty sure I can sell any steeds we get."
"Excellent. I'll send the proper letters, then, and have some fresh horses delivered straightaway."
Lookin' forward to it.
I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of Whiterun hold.
"Again? You just had an [QUOTE]extended hunt[QUOTE] last month. To the Pine Forest, wasn't it."
That was three days. I'm thinking more like three weeks.
Three weeks? You're mad! You can't keep the stand closed for that long!
Why not? Business has been terrible. Most folk would rather hunt their own meat than buy ours.
"Nonsense. That's just an excuse for you to avoid working, and [QUOTE]commune with the greenwood like our fathers of old[QUOTE] and blah blah."
"Congratulations, brother. You've been living in Skyrim so long, you've become a Nord."
At least the Nords don't shirk their responsibilities.
Our stock of arrows is running a bit low.
All right. I'll fletch some more when I get the time.
Good. I'll do the same. We've still got plenty of shafts from that Riverwood shipment.
"It's been two months, and no word from father."
"Don't worry, brother. I'm sure he's fine. We've waited longer before receiving a letter."
"Might be worth riding out to Solitude, see if a messenger ship's come in."
"If it'll put your mind at ease, then I agree. But not now, all right? We need the business from the stand."
"Oh look, it's little baby Battle-Born."
"Leave me alone, Braith..."
What are you gonna do if I don't? Huh? Gonna cry to your papa?
Just go away!
Battle-Born! Give me your money!
I... I don't have any money.
"You'd better give me five septims, right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose..."
"No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me."
"Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip."
Braith. I.... I've come to tell you that I'm not afraid of you anymore.
"Don't make me laugh, baby Battle-Born. You'll be afraid of me till the day I kill you."
You... You're wrong! You can't hurt me anymore...
Oh no? So you're gonna fight back if I punch you? Huh? You're gonna hit a girl?
"Well, no... I... I mean..."
"That's what I thought. Now get out of my way, baby. I got things to do."
"So I'm, uh... writing a song for you..."
"Why Jon Battle-Born. You're writing me a song? Does it somehow involve blood, or beheadings, or the honor of my forebears?"
"Well, that's where I started. But it turned into something of a ballad."
"A ballad? Oh, now I know you're joking with me."
"It's all true, I swear it. You can hear it when it's done. I'll just need a year or two smooth the rough edges."
So have you spoken to that man from the Bards College?
"No, not yet. But I will. I just haven't... gotten around to it yet."
"Oh Jon, stop dallying. You know you have to go. It's why Mara put you on this earth."
You think a few miles can truly keep us apart?
"You mean you won't forget about me the moment I'm out of sight? Get yourself a nice old rich husband, have sixteen babies?"
Tsk. You've uncovered my master plan. Now I suppose you'll never leave.
Harlot.
I want to see you when you're done working.
"I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my father is starting to suspect something."
"I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my family is starting to suspect something."
That's your imagination running wild. Nobody knows how we feel about each other.
"Don't talk about my father like that, Jon. And the answer's still no."
But tomorrow. Definitely.
Don't say that out loud. Not here. And the answer's still no.
But tomorrow. Definitely.
Fancy a game of Iron Hearts later?
"You going to lose horribly, and then say you let me win?"
Probably.
Then you're on.
You ain't made me that stew in a long time.
"Which, the mutton or the vegetable?"
Mutton.
"Hmm. So I haven't. All right, I'll buy the ingredients tomorrow and we can have it for dinner."
"There's a chill in the air. Ysmir's beard, it gets colder in here every day."
"That's just you getting skinnier every day, old man. You're losing your padding. You need to eat more."
"Well if my layabout manservant fed me more, that wouldn't be a problem."
Oho! Manservant? Is that what I am now?
"My mistake. A manservant wouldn't let me starve or freeze. I let you live here, and now I'm two steps closer to the grave."
"Old man, without me, you would have withered away a long time ago."
Hmph. Damn you for being right.
"Papa, I want to talk to you..."
Hmm? What about?
"Well, there's this boy, and..."
"Listen, Braith... Why don't you talk to your mother about this, okay? There's a good girl."
I wish your mother were still alive. She could answer you much better. Let me think on it and we'll talk later.
Mother?
What?
I wanted to ask you something. It's about a boy...
"Not now, Braith. Go... go ask your father."
Mother? Can I talk to you?
"Not now, Braith."
But...
"Not now, Braith."
"Papa, the next time you go away, I want to come with you."
"When I go away, I go to war. That's no place for a little girl."
"Every knight needs a squire. I could help you with your sword, things like that."
"Nice try, blossom, but I'm not a knight, I'm a mercenary. The answer's still no. Besides, your mother would miss you too much."
Yeah. Right.
Aringoth sold Goldenglow? What's that idiot thinking?
"He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out."
If only this parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol. Any idea what that might be?
"Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and speak to Mercer."
"But for now, you're off to speak to Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by name."
I'll give you one good reason. Maven Black-Briar.
Burn all the hives and she'd have to import honey for Black-Briar Meadery which would cut into her profits.
Worthless mercenaries.
"I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow me to get away with this, but I had little choice."
"I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat."
Fine. Take it!
"Once the new owner finds out I gave in, I'm as good as dead anyway."
I don't believe you. That's not your way.
"Keep your eyes open, they'll try to hit us again... I just know it."
"If they do, we'll send them crying back to their boss again."
I can't believe how lucky we got landing this job. It's a far cry from working for the Stormcloaks.
You're telling me. Playing nursemaid to a bunch of bees and drinking mead all day beats dying on some battlefield.
So why did he sell this place? I mean look at it. This is how to live.
No idea. Maybe he got tired of getting stung by these damn bees.
Agh... so bored! Only one fight in the last few weeks? This is gonna' drive me crazy.
"Aringoth said as soon as the deed goes through, we're done here. Then we'll head south and look for more work. Deal?"
Did you get a look at that thief that they sent to break into the place? What I wouldn't give for a night with her.
Sure. Then you wake up in the morning with your purse empty and your gear stolen. No thanks.
"Have you seen Refnir? I told him to check out the well drain, but he never reported back."
Probably got drunk and fell into the lake. Who cares.
You are exactly what I was looking for.
My brother told me you were coming. I'm supposed to give you what you've earned.
You're the one Mazzaka described to me.
I'm Captain Aldis. I'm here to help you take down these bandits.
"We're stretched thin in Solitude, and I don't expect these bandits to be much challenge. Are you ready?"
With pleasure.
"First you murder my sister, then you massacre my men!"
"You've betrayed me, murdered my sister and massacred my men!"
It's appreciated. The captains around here will have one less thing to worry about. Here's your reward.
Good riddance.
I'll take care of it.
"I've been away from Solitude for as long as I can. But if you decide to finish these bandits off, you'll be rewarded for your efforts."
Really?
"Well, I do recall warning them it might not be the safest of locations. I hope this doesn't become a problem for us."
Were you able to learn anything?
Hmm. I can't say I've any idea what they were up to. Have you found this observatory?
"You might be able to learn something from it. Keep looking, but be careful."
"I can't imagine what that might be, but if it's safe, you might see if they were successful."
"You could get some useful information about whatever they were up to. Sounds like it won't be of use to them now, anyway."
What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?
"It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything!"
"If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted."
"And you. If you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've wasted your time."
And just why would you be doing that?
"Oh, it doesn't matter now. Gavros is never coming back, and he was supposed to have the crystal. Without that, we're lost."
It's all been for nothing.
"So congratulations, whoever you are, you've found the Synod. Just me, alone, surrounded by angry machines and angrier Falmer."
"It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't listen. [QUOTE]No, it won't be too cold[QUOTE] he said."
"Well, I was right, wasn't I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had warped it!"
Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.
I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's all you need to know.
"I might well ask the same of you, running around by yourself in this dangerous place."
It's time to leave.
Not without a fight it isn't!
"As soon as we can muster our forces, we'll be back."
That's the battle you need to fight. Not this. This will be suicide. And to what end?
And my children?
"I assume everyone's gone ahead of us as planned. I just swept through the castle, no one's here."
"Now. We really must be going, sir."
Fine. Let's go.
"Come. You, too. We can escape through the tunnels."
"First, an incantation to remove the barrier."
Forgive me if I don't appear relieved... this temple has taken its toll on me.
"In time, I believe I will."
Yes. The Skull has been destroyed and Dawnstar is safe.
"Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or coin, but perhaps I can offer you something better... companionship."
I'd constructed a meager shrine to Mara in the antechamber where we entered.
"My intention was to spend the rest of my years here, burying the past and praying for forgiveness."
"But instead, I wish to offer my services to you. If you ever wish to journey with me, I'll be here."
There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of Dawnstar.
"If anyone should be thanked, it should be you."
"Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you."
Look out! The prisoners are loose!
"Look, I... I..."
"You're right. You're right. Feller might be nutters, might not. But fact is, he needs help. I turn him away, what kind of man am I, hmm?"
"Look, um... Thanks. And I'm sorry for my unneighborly reaction. If you talk to Cicero, you be sure and tell him I'll be down to help soon."
Who enters? Will nobody save poor Melka?
"Careful here, there's a trick to this. Trick is to not bleed to death. Ah, and there's a lever, too."
I will be waiting at Reachcliff.
Say hello to Verulus for me.
Namira covets your ugliness.
Blessed are the forgotten. The wretched.
The dead exist to feed the living.
"Don't worry, the Eight are watching over us. I hope."
You've returned. What happened in the Hall of the Dead?
Find out what's happening in the Hall of the Dead. Arkay will watch over you.
"If it's about the Hall of the Dead, no, you can't go in there."
"Not many would walk blindly into a crypt, smelling of steel and blood, but not fear."
I feel the hunger inside of you. Gnawing at you. You see the dead and your mouth grows wet. Your stomach growls.
Arkay keeps the cycle. He watches us in life and death.
Arkay will guard our eternal rest. His servants shall protect the dead from harm.
"Protect us, Arkay, from the foul and unclean who seek to disturb the dead's rest."
"Let us sleep, sweet Arkay, by your side. Let no harm come to us."
Tread lightly in the Hall. We don't know what's in there.
My daughter Fjotli... she was murdered a few months ago. Left her laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood.
"I assume they were after her valuables... she always wore far too much jewelry in public. When I told her it'd be the death of her, I never thought..."
"No need to explain, I'm well aware of your Guild's methods."
"It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine?"
Let's just say I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye and leave it at that.
"He fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know."
"Well, like I told Delvin, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process."
"Exactly. One of the pieces stolen from her was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back."
The only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking.
"It pains me to see this locket... to be reminded of  Fjotli once more, but I'm glad it's back where it belongs."
"Tell Delvin that if he still desires to have my support for the Thieves Guild in Windhelm, he's got it."
I'm still amazed that your plan worked.
You'll be the toast of Whiterun for this!
No one can doubt that you truly are Dragonborn.
"We're ready, Dragonborn. Just say the word."
You're getting pretty good at this dragon-fighting business.
I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this plan of yours.
"My job is to keep the Jarl safe, despite his best efforts."
I can't believe that worked!
"Something to tell the grandkids, eh?"
I can't believe I'm still alive.
He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead.
"If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!"
Very true! Hmm. I wonder... do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?
"Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to hold a captive dragon - hence its name."
"Well, you see, the palace - Dragonsreach - was originally built to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name."
"Oh, this was thousands of years ago, before the Akaviri crusaders cleansed Skyrim of dragons."
Skyrim's mountains were still infested with dragons. One of the early Nord kings caught a dragon and kept it in Dragonsreach.
"You could trap him there, exactly."
"Yes, yes. We must think. He must have some means of travelling to and from Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be."
"The Jarl's palace in Whiterun? Ah, yes... the old story about King Olaf's pet dragon. Ingenious!"
G...Gavros? Is that you?
I'd almost given up hope. Let me get the door...
What the...
Who are you? Where's Gavros?
"You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to Arn, there'll be hell to pay."
A close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us.
Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in Solitude.
Hold a moment. This is more than a simple prison break. I want to have Arn's name stricken from the record books permanently.
I'm setting him up with a new identity. It's the only way to throw the guard permanently off his trail.
"The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn."
The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.
"The city guard in Solitude is seeking Arn for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine?"
"Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him."
"If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional."
"You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers."
"One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid."
I have eyes within Dragonsreach. They tell me that all correspondence from other holds are sent to the Jarl's private chambers.
It's a well-known fact that the steward keeps all of the records on Whiterun's prisoners in a large book.
My sources tell me you can find that book in a study in his quarters.
Change Arn's entry in the book to anything you want and they'll be forced to let him go after he serves a few weeks.
Arn? Never heard of him.
I guess that means you're finished. Here's your payment.
Tell Delvin that he has my support and all the weight it carries in Whiterun from now on. I think he'll be quite pleased.
It's about time you got here.
I'm not accustomed to dealing with people who are unreliable. That's why I asked Delvin to send me his best.
Hmph. That remains to be seen.
That's more like it.
Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time.
Captain Volf of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established.
I need you to help me show him the error of his ways by sneaking on board the Sload and planting some contraband.
"You'll need to get your hands on some Balmora Blue from Sabine Nyette down by the docks. She's the first mate on another ship, the Red Wave."
"Once you get your hands on it, I want you to plant it in Captain Volf's footlocker. I'll take care of the rest."
Captain Volf is ashore right now and I want the authorities waiting for him when he gets back.
Now get going... I don't want to see your face until the job's done.
"Yes, I know. In fact, by now, Captain Volf should be on his way to the prisons."
Our contract is complete. Here's a token of my gratitude for your efforts.
"Oh, convey my compliments to Delvin for me. Tell him I'll be happy to reopen whatever doors he needs in Solitude."




"Get back! Get back! We need to trap it, not kill it!"
Take cover!
"This is getting ridiculous. If we can't get this open soon, the boss will have our heads."
Lure it into the trap! I'm counting on you!
Do whatever you're going to do before it kills us all!
My men are ready. Now it's up to you.
"Come, my men stand ready on the great porch."
Let's do this. Summon this dragon of yours.
Get it into the trap before it kills us all!
Let's get this over with.
"This was your crazy idea, huh?"
You better know what you're doing.
I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this.
Let's get this over with.
"What? An intruder? Attack, my lovelies!"
"Ah, another plaything for my collection."
What's happening? No! Leave me alone!
The others do not speak. Their Voices are too powerful for you to withstand.
"As my Thane, I'm sworn to your service. I'll guard you, and all you own, with my life."
Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck!
To feed my power when I come for you in Sovngarde!
"Yes. You're right. If they needed to die so that Dawnstar could live, then it was worth the price."
"And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would be sealed. You have a unique way of looking at things, my friend."
No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception.
"Had we aided them in releasing the Skull, they would use it to wreak havoc across Skyrim. They... they had to die."
It's time. The Skull must be destroyed.
"If you'll stand back, I'll perform the ritual granted to me by Lady Mara."
Wait...
Veren... Thorek... you're alive!
"No thanks to you, Casimir."
"I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, Priest of Mara."
You're a traitor. You left us to die and then ran before the Miasma took you.
No. I... I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.
Enough of your lies!
"I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara."
Then you leave me no choice!
"Watch your tongue, stranger. We don't take backtalk in this inn."
I long to taste battle again.
"I cannot go into battle without a sword, Hjalti."
"You don't remember me, Hjalti? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again."
Disappointing.
"On your way, then."
Very well.
I thought I was clear when I said I didn't know.
"Endon's mold? I'm afraid you have the wrong place, my friend. You'll find no silversmiths here."
"I assure you, I have nothing of value. I'm nothing but a poor woodcutter just trying to make ends meet."
"Well uh, Endon is a silversmith in Markarth, so I just assumed..."
"So that's how it's going to be, huh? Fine. Take your best shot!"
No harm done. Tell this Endon fellow I hope he finds what he's looking for.
"Well, can't say exactly where the mold is, but something does spring to mind."
It seems there's this strange button on the wall opposite the fireplace in my house. Always wondered what it was for.
"Think I'm going to head out now. Take a long vacation from woodcutting, you know? Good luck."
"Come on, what are trying to do? Insult me?"
Oh thank goodness! I wasn't sure where else to turn...
Several months ago I ordered a special silver mold from some artisans in Valenwood by way of a Khajiit Caravan.
"Well, it never arrived. Later I found out that it was robbed by a group of bandits led by someone named Rigel Strong-Arm."
"Look, I talked to the Jarl, the Steward, the Housecarl... everyone. They all told me their resources were spread too thin right now."
Word on the street says that the Thieves Guild is coming back into its own in Markarth so I figured...
Exactly.
"Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild."
"Yes, indeed. The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch."
"I'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you. Good luck."
You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward.
Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it.
"If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do."
Come to gawk at the monster?
"Verner, you should have come out with me yesterday. I found the most amazing tree growing right out of a cave."
And I found a new deposit of amber. Would have been nice to have some help pulling it out.
You used to love finding new places.
I still do. I just like to have food waiting for me when I come home.
"Sweetheart, did you move my pickaxe?"
It's at the south end near that loose rockpile.
So you can be helpful sometimes.
No need to get snippy.
Ever think about spending more time around town?
Not when there's so much to see!
I guess I should join you more often.
You should. I miss you.
Thanks for looking after Hrefna.
"Oh, it's no trouble. She's a smart little girl. Might talk your ear off, but she's fun."
"Well, I know she thinks the world of you."
"Well, I'll try to be a good influence, then."
"Sondas, does Hrefna ever mention Meieran to you?"
She hardly mentions anything else.
I'm just worried about what he's teaching her.
I wouldn't worry about that. He's a good elf. I trust him.
You're probably right.
Daar sul thur se Alduin vokrii. Today Alduin's lordship will be restored.
"But I honor your courage. Krif voth ahkrin. Die now, in vain."
For Skyrim!
This library used to be filled with arcane volumes. Now look at it; almost everything's been burned.
I hope the tome we need is still intact.
"Hakon! A glorious day, is it not!"
Have you no thought beyond the blooding of your blade?
What else is there?
"The battle below goes ill. If Alduin does not rise to our challenge, I fear all may be lost."
"You worry too much, brother. Victory will be ours."
"You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, [QUOTE]Dah,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Push.[QUOTE]"
"With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use it wisely."
Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of [QUOTE]Dah.[QUOTE]
"Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Wuld,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Whirlwind.[QUOTE]"
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Nah[QUOTE] - [QUOTE]Fury[QUOTE] - the second word of Whirlwind Sprint.
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Kest[QUOTE] - [QUOTE]Tempest[QUOTE]- the third word of Whirlwind Sprint.
We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout.
I see that you have already begun to learn the Whirlwind Sprint Shout.
"Comes with living to a ripe old age, people start thinking there's something magical about you. Then, the insults."
"Still, a little knowledge of plants and potions can get you by. Not that anyone likes to admit buying things from you."
See? I even have a little potion for the Steward. Mind handing it over to him? Just say it should solve that problem he has.
Thank you.
Pity.
"Oh... yes... um... thank you. Here you go. Some gold for your assistance and your, discretion."
"No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn!"
Ha! We'll see about that!
You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!
"Then go back to your boss and tell him what I've already told him so many times, I lose count."
His request is denied... I'm not paying him any more gold. This madness has to end.
Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.
I'll send word to the strongholds to let you in as one of our own.
Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.
"Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes."
"We must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time to lose."
"Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say."
"When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters behind to die."
And what would you have me say? Sorry for following the misguided teachings of a mad Divine? Sorry for stealing memories from children?
"Do you realize when the orcs attacked, I was only concerned with myself? I fled... and left my brothers and sisters behind to die."
"I've spent the last few decades living in regret and seeking redemption from Mara. And by Her Benevolence, I will right my wrongs."
It's just up here.
Be careful... we're certain to find more of the awakened within.
Thanks! I'm out!
"Sondas, I've heard about Morrowind."
Oh? What about it?
That it was black and gross and nobody wanted to live there anymore.
"I'll have to take your word on that one, my dear."
"Do you ever want to go to Morrowind, Sondas?"
I've been in Skyrim my whole life. Why would I want to leave?
To see the fires!
I think I like the lake here just a little more.
And Meieran thinks that we should go there.
"I don't want to hear another word about what you're learning from the elf! It's high time you learned to be a Nord, too!"
But mama...
He's a half-decent farmer. Ask him to teach you to farm!
Hagraven up ahead. Pull the lever when you're ready and we'll take her.
Locked. Damn! One of the hags nearby will have the key. You'll have to take it from here. I'll keep watch here - unless you can pick the lock.
He didn't want to hit the bar like the rest! Ha ha ha!
Oh my... that's the worst one yet. How about we stop talking and keep our eyes open like Gulum-Ei said?
"What, seriously? Come on, I thought that was funny!"
"We go up, yes? Always up."
Such a kind nibble you are.
"You, meat! Come, come."
Don't leave poor Melka to die.
Petra! Petra! Curse her eyes!
Do you like my pretty tower?
"Petra! Evil Petra put me here, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat."
"Because, because you are such a nice Breton, yes!"
"Ah, I have a pretty staff. Help me find Petra, wring her neck, pluck her eyes. Take my prize staff, I just want my tower back!"
Oh. Yes. You all look the same.
Because you are such a very nice Orc?
"Live in my tower, roost in my home. Mix pretty poisons and collect shiny eyeballs, yes."
"Yes, kind morsel. Let us go up, and mind Melka on the way."
"Press only middle button! Clever trick, yes? Nobody ever thinks of the middle."
What? That flower-chewer's died? Then let me out. My tower!
You'd better find that chest that fell off the boat or Gulum-Ei will have your hide!
"I know! I know! Just shut up and let me look, okay?"
"Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open."
What? How did you get this far?
What? No! Get back in your cage!
Is there anything more revolting than spiders? Too many legs...
"You know, I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago."
I can't wait to see what the future brings.
I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?
This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.
By the gods... you! But it can't be. You're dead. You... Yeaaaahhhh!
"Speak, if you have aught to say worth the listening."
Now you see why I've warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!
So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you.
Did he tell you what you wanted to know? Did he teach you the Dragonrend Shout?
So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this... we will bow to his wisdom.
We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things.
As for where to find it... such blasphemies have always been the stock in trade of the mages of Winterhold.
They may be able to tell you something about the Elder Scroll you seek.
"The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax?"
Listen to your inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into doing something you will later regret.
"After all, repentance is something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called justice."
"You're learning, Dragonborn. Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult."
"I trust that you will make the right choice, in the end. Listen to the Voice that Kynareth has placed within you, and your path will be clear."
"Kynareth has placed the Voice of wisdom within you, Dragonborn. All you need do is learn to listen to it, and your path will be clear."
"My oath binds me, Dragonborn. Until Paarthurnax is dead, you aren't welcome here."
Do the right thing. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
We have nothing to talk about until Paarthurnax is dead.
"You shouldn't be here, unless you've decided to bring Paarthurnax to justice."
What further business do you have with us?
"You have made your choice, Dragonborn. You are not welcome here."
"Speak, and then begone."
This is how you repay our trust? Paarthurnax's trust?
"His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone, and for what?"
A mindless vendetta urged on you by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians!
"Begone, before even my philosophy is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace, and you are not."
I'll be the one asking the questions.
"All you need to know is that the Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above the law."
"They have clashed with the Aldmeri Dominion before, and I have no intention of allowing that to happen here."
"Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion, and I cannot ignore this situation."
"Don't worry, you can return to your petty squabbles and meaningless 'research' as soon as this matter is resolved."
Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.
I merely wish to talk to you.
"I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief."
"The situation here at your College is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed."
I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The Eye of Magnus as your people have taken to calling it.
The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen.
"The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with."
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal.
"You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically... intervene directly in events."
"My presence here will be seen as an affront to some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be leaving your College."
"I'm all too aware that my arrival has aroused suspicion, especially in Ancano, your Thalmor associate."
"Nevertheless, my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do so."
"As you may have learned, this object... The Eye... is immensely powerful."
"This world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will be misused."
"Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already... Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be avoided."
"We believe the your efforts should be directed towards dealing with the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be."
"Unfortunately, the future is as obscured to us as it is to you. The overwhelming power of the Eye makes it difficult for us to see."
"I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College."
His perception may be more coherent than ours.
I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order?
"The Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will not allow them to control us."
I assure you that we mean you no harm.
He was once a student here at the College. Now he is... something different.
I... I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one of your colleagues must know his location.
"I am sorry I cannot provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a great deal of effort on my part."
"Now, I am afraid I must leave you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we can."
It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.
So you were right. Go tell the Jarl. Hurry!
Die rebel!
Send Ulfric my regards!
You call yourself a warrior?
For the Emperor!
For the glory of the Empire!
Die dog!
A pox on the Empire!
I'll water the ground with your blood.
For the sons of Skyrim!
Talos smite you!
We're almost through!
They're at the gate!
We're through! Keep at them!
They're in! Don't let them gain further ground!
Keep it together! There's not many of us left!
This is hopeless! Retreat!
"Yeaaaah! Come on, we can take them!"
Here they come!
That's it! We're pushing them back!
"Fall back, fall back! Regroup and fall back!"
We've got them pinned in! It's only a matter of time now. Keep fighting!
This is it! Hold at all costs! Don't give them any more ground!
Someone take out that mage!
Someone put an arrow in that damn wizard!
Take out their archers!
Archers!
Over by that bridge!
"Along the fence, do you see them?"
They got archers over there by the fence!
Wizard! Hiding over there by that fence!
"They're over there, next to that house!"
By that rock over there. See 'em?
They're hiding over by those stables!
Up in that tower! Quick!
Archer in that tower!
Mage up there! In the tower!
Over by the tree!
They're up on that wall.
They got archers up along the wall!
Look! Up on the wall. A wizard!
Look sharp. There they are. In the window!
Archers. Behind those windows!
They've got a mage hiding in that window up there!
Laelette! She's dead!
Ysmir's beard! She's...she's a vampire!
"Derkeethus, from Darkwater Crossing."
Should have known better than to swim all the way to the falls.
"Please, get me out of here!"
"By Sithis, what a mess. I guess this is the end."
You just worry about fulfilling the contract. I'll take care of things on this end.
What? Well - what did she say?
Amaund Motierre? But that would mean...
"Hmph. All right, then. Go. Go, my Listener. Find out what that slimy bastard Motierre has to say, then send the Emperor to Sithis."
"Ah, but when you're done, there's no use returning here, is there? I was thinking... the Dawnstar Sanctuary. We could make a proper home there."
"Listen, when you're finished with this Emperor business, meet Babette and me there. I'll find some way to move the Night Mother. Don't worry. Now go!"
"And come back with a barrel full of gold, hmm?"
"Babette, my girl - pack your things. We're moving."
I was hoping you'd say that.
"I'll admit, I'm having trouble coming to terms with all of this. I'll just follow Nazir's lead."
"Please, make haste. The Emperor's ship won't stayed moored forever. We won't get a chance like this again."
"Well I'll be damned. We heard you were dead. Motierre's in the back room, if you've got business."
Who will start?
I'll do it.
The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor. You'll have to prove yourselves to them.
It's not that you're intruding. I'd wager they've actually expected us.
They just want to be sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.
"What are you doing here, outlander? We don't deal with your kind."
This is our stronghold. Leave.
Outsiders. Nothing but trouble.
Malacath blesses us with this land. It's not for your kind.
This stronghold is for the Orcs. Leave. Now.
"We don't know you, and we don't want you here."
"Leave, outlander."
You've no right to be here. This place is for Orcs. And Orcs alone.
Outlanders should learn to not wander where they don't belong.
"I don't believe it. You found the Forgemaster's Fingers. You've impressed me, outlander. No one else has returned from this task before."
"By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Kin to the Orcs. Let it be known among the strongholds that you are family, now."
"Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman."
"Welcome to our stronghold, Blood-Kin."
"Few outsiders earn the right to enter our strongholds. Speak with more respect, or we might forget your gifts."
"Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman."
What's the bloody hold up in there? How long can it take to run through a few scraggly assassins?
"If they were easy to kill, don't you think we would have done it years ago? If our men aren't out in a few minutes, they're dead, trust me."
"Anyway, I can smell the smoke. They've already set the place alight."
"And so ends the Dark Brotherhood, once and for all. About bloody time."
It's our wedding day. I feel like all of Skyrim is focused on just the two of us.
"This is a fine wedding. And to think, it's for us."
This ceremony is so different from an Orc marriage. Less blood.
I never would have dreamed I would be getting married in the Temple of Mara.
Weddings always make me cry. What am I supposed to do now that I'm the one getting married?
"It's a simple ceremony, but it'll do. You're here. That's enough."
Who would have thought I would be getting married?
How could you? Just go.
I don't want to see you ever again.
Get away from me. Liar!
You should leave. Now.
Get out. Leave me alone!
You're abandoning me? Me? I never want to see you ever again.
Get out of my sight.
Get out.
Congratulations on your wedding. I'm so happy for both of you.
Just leave.
[QUOTE]Forgiveness is the heart of Mara's blessings.[QUOTE] Very well. We shall re-arrange your wedding.
Tomorrow. Same time as before.
Well I think your betrothed might feel otherwise. The two of you will need to work this out before the temple will marry you.
"Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?"
"Under the authority of Mara, the Divine of Love, I declare this couple to be wed."
"I present the two of you with these matching rings, blessed by Mara's divine grace. May they protect each of you in your new life together."
You're just going to walk away from your betrothal? Get out of the temple.
"Ah, here's the blushing bride now. Let's begin the ceremony."
"Ah, here's the proud groom now. Let's begin the ceremony."
"Where am I? You! Out with it, then."
"Ah, I was beginning to think the day would never come. So you broke the binding spell, did you? Matters little."
"Their souls are trapped in Oblivion all the same, and here I stay."
"Where I belong is back aboard my ship, on the Abecean."
"You've no hope of defeating me, pup. Don't bother. Why not broker a bargain, instead?"
"Have it your own way, meat."
"Those kids are dead anyway. Killing me won't bring them back. I, on the other hand, have done quite a bit with my time on Mundus."
"Release me, and I'll share a bit of my wealth with you."
"Years back, I had to ferret away some booty nearby. We'd sunk an Imperial Galleon off the coast. Good plunder, but we needed to travel light."
"We stashed what we couldn't carry, and I hid it with a trick I know. I can point you in the right direction, and we'll each go our separate ways."
"Names have power, lad. You should know by now. Just say [QUOTE]Velehk Sain, I release you.[QUOTE], and [QUOTE]Poof![QUOTE], I'm on my way."
"Names have power, lass. You should know by now. Just say [QUOTE]Velehk Sain, I release you.[QUOTE], and [QUOTE]Poof![QUOTE], I'm on my way."
There's a smart lad. Take the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
There's a smart lass. Check the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
"Clever try, scab, but it won't be that easy!"
This looks like the way.
"Come on, hurry up."
Better to stick together down here.
This way.
"Come on, hurry up."
Better to stick together down here.
Rise up and live again!
I grant you a new life!
"Come on, get up!"
This should work. I've done it before.
Gah! This staff is useless... I'm useless. The whole world is useless!
Oh... hello there. Didn't notice you come up. I was focusing my magicka.
"Or at least, I thought I was. I don't really know what I'm doing."
You don't have to tell me that.
"I used to think so, too."
"See, my grandfather was a wizard. My father wouldn't talk about him much. But I found some of his things in the attic. Including this staff."
"After that I thought I was turning into a wizard too, because dead things near me would come to life again for while."
"I even went to the College of Winterhold. But they just laughed at me. The magic is in the staff, not in me they said."
In fact. Keep it. I must have used up the magic in the staff or something. It's just a dumb stick of wood now.
My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through the city.
"But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do."
"Here, I have a delivery I need to make to Calcelmo. Why don't you take it to him? He knows the history of Markarth better than anyone."
"Do I look like a guide? Only thing I do is sell meat. Now, are you going to buy or not?"
"Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting to pick that up. Poor Kerah, such a patient woman."
"Now, you're supposed to get something for your trouble, aren't you? How about some gold? People seem to like that, I notice."
"To protect my research, for one. There are more cutthroat scholars out there who would steal my findings if they got the chance."
And the excavations into Nchuand-Zel are dangerous. Dwemer machines and traps still function even after thousands of years.
"Oh, by the Divines is it that obvious? I swear, if my Gunnar was alive to see me now."
This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to Forsworn attacks. A specially-made Dibella statuette.
"You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn."
"Ah, there it is! This little gold delight is going to keep us afloat for a while. Thank you. Here's something for your hard work."
"Mortals call it Dawnbreaker, for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life."
"You will enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty blade."
I'm afraid the Winterhold you see before you is somewhat... underwhelming.
"I can assure you, though, that it was quite something in its prime. An early capital of Skyrim, you know."
"Sadly, the Oblivion Crisis took its toll on Winterhold, in more ways than one. Then, the Great Collapse swallowed most of our beloved city."
"What's there to tell? It's mostly gone now, thanks to those damned mages in the College."
Someday there'll be proof they caused the Great Collapse. Most of a city just dropping off into the sea... That doesn't just happen.
I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be.
"You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn."
"Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some."
We should keep moving.
We'd best be careful in here.
It's starting to look like Esbern was right.
Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords.
"Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time."
I know the prophecy by heart. Once all Blades knew it.
"Well, I'm going to look around some more. See what the old Blades left for us."
"Yes... yes, that's an excellent idea. Who knows what other lost treasures we might discover?"
I'll stay here. You try not to get into too much trouble.
As you wish. Just don't forget about me.
"Here? Right here? Very well, J'zargo shall wait."
Certainly. Be careful.
All right. Don't take too long.
All right. Don't be long.
You sure? All right. I'll keep guard here.
If you say so.
Don't make me wait too long. I get bored very easily.
"Patience isn't exactly my strong suit, but alright."
As you wish.
I'll be right here. Be careful now!
"As you wish, my Thane."
Very well. Just be careful!
I'll wait here. Just don't start any trouble without me.
You go on ahead.
(growl)
"Head on, then. I'll keep an eye out."
I'll keep watch from here.
You sure? Fine. I'll stand watch.
Go on ahead. I'll stand guard.
I'm right with you.
J'zargo is ready for more adventure.
Of course. Let's go.
"Certainly, I'm ready."
I'm ready. Let's go.
Good. We should keep moving.
I've got your back.
Good. I'm ready for anything.
Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens.
Onward to our next adventure!
I am the shadow at your back.
Good! Let's go find something to fight.
I'm ready.
Great! Let's go!
"As you will, my Thane. I will protect you with my life."
(bark)
Let's get going.
I will walk alongside you.
Khajiit walks in your footsteps.
To the next fight.
Lead the way.
Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had to learn to use their power.
"Those that shrank from their destiny... well, you've never heard of them, have you?"
"And there are the villains - those that misused their power. There's always a choice, and there's always a risk."
"But if you live in fear of what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the Greybeards up on their mountain."
"Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn you away from your destiny."
"You're Dragonborn, and you're the only one who can stop Alduin. Don't forget it."
"Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde."
I worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord warrior.
Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord Hircine.
"Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I crave the fellowship of Sovngarde."
"Yes, but it's no easy matter."
But you don't need to share the worries of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery!
"Oh. I'm sorry I said anything, then."
I see.
If that is your wish.
Very well. I am poorer for it.
"What are you, some kind of tease? Stendarr's Mercy...."
"Waste of time, then."
Your choice.
Wonderful. Where to begin?
"Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost."
We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.
"Yes. If you were ready, of course. Are you familiar with how marriage works in Skyrim?"
"Typically, love in Skyrim is as earnest as the people who live here. Life is hard, and short, so there is little room for long courtship."
"A person who is looking for a spouse simply wears an Amulet of Mara about the neck, showing they are available."
"When another person shows interest, and the two agree to be together, one of them comes to the Temple and we arrange a ceremony."
"Well, yes. Why wouldn't I be? Are you... interested in me?"
"I am. I'd be glad to stand by your side until the Divines take us, if you'll have me."
"You're strong. Clever. I'd be proud to face the challenges of life with you, if you feel the same way."
"You have a kind heart. I'd be honored to walk by your side until the trees themselves fade away, if you would have me."
I'd be a fool to turn down a chance of marrying you. I'm game if you're game!
"You are pleasant company, more than pleasant. And what about you? Would you... be interested in a life together?"
"Won't lie, I am. And you?"
"It's settled then. Brief as life can be in Skyrim, at least we'll have each other."
Together.
And mine is yours.
"As short as life can be in this land, we will have each other."
"Well, look at us, getting married. Life in Skyrim ain't all bad, huh?"
Good. The two of us then. All of Skyrim should get ready to stand aside.
Then it's settled. You and me.
"I'm not exactly... comfortable around guards or jails. Definitely not when associates of mine have been locked up. No, I'll meet you outside of town."
Really? Now that is interesting...
Then you should know that Louis and I have a certain... history.
"Tell you what. Go along with his plans for now. I'll keep an eye on you both and, when the time is right, I'll settle accounts with Louis."
Looking for work? I need someone to deliver a message to Sibbi Black-Briar.
I'm still looking for someone to deliver my message to Sibbi Black-Briar...
It was Mara that first gave birth to all of creation and pledged to watch over us as her children.
It is from her love of us that we first learned to love one another. It is from this love that we learn that a life lived alone is no life at all.
"We gather here today, under Mara's loving gaze, to bear witness to the union of two souls in eternal companionship."
"May they journey forth together in this life and the next, in prosperity and poverty, and in joy and hardship."
"Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?"
I do. Now and forever.
"Alduin's wings, they did darken the sky. His roar fury's fire, and his scales sharpened scythes."
"Men ran and they cowered, and they fought and they died. They burned and they bled as they issued their cries."
We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage. Heroes on the field of this new war to wage.
"And if Alduin wins, man is gone from this world. Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled."
"But then came the Tongues on that terrible day. Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray."
"And all heard the music of Alduin's doom. The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um."
"And so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage. Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new Age."
"If Alduin is eternal, then eternity's done. For his story is over and the dragons are... gone."
"Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart."
"I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes."
With a Voice wielding power of the ancient Nord art.
"Believe, believe, the Dragonborn comes."
"It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes."
"Beware, beware, the Dragonborn comes."
"For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows."
"You'll know, You'll know the Dragonborn's come."
"We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone. For the age of oppression is now nearly done."
"We drink to our youth, to days come and gone. For the age of aggression is just about done."
We'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own. With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.
We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own. With our blood and our steel we'll take back our home.
All hail to Ulfric! You are the High King! In your great honor we drink and we sing.
Down with Ulfric the killer of kings. On the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing.
"We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!"
But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.
"There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!"
"And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!"
"But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said..."
"[QUOTE]Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed![QUOTE]"
"And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!"
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
"Dragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay!"
"And the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumph's shout, Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!"
"Hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one!"
"Who was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun!"
"And the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Tamriel shuddered with war!"
"Mighty Thu'um, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Dragonborn issued his roar!"
"And the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled!"
"Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world!"
"But a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon's lies, will be silenced forever and then!"
"Fair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin's maw, Dragonborn be the savior of men!"
"Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin, wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal!"
"Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan, Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal!"

"You might just make it. But for now, you're still a whelp to us, new blood. So you do what we tell you."
"Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you are."
You are not welcome here!
Unworthy!
Fall before the will of Sithis!
You dare invade this Sanctuary?
Yeagh!
Heyargh!
Grrr!
The Dread Lord awaits!
I... am Lucien Lachance.
"Another soul for you, Father!"
"I weep for you, mortal."
Another thrall for the Void!
Yeagh!
Raaarr!
Grrrarrggh!
Huuragh!
Ha ha ha ha!
For the Night Mother!
Who's the fool now?
"Stab you, stab you, stab you!"
Yeagh!
Raarrgh!
Grraaagghh!
Eyyaargh!
Pathetic!
Yeargh!

You dare invade my home?

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"You can't kill what's already dead, mortal."
Ugh!
Oof!
Nuh!
Ha ha! I've suffered worse!
There is no pain in the Void!
You would shut out the darkness?
You wish to kill me? Someone has already had that honor.
Ugh!
Agh!
Ooof!
Nyargh!
Come on! Do it again! Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm bleeding! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ow! Cheap shot!
Is that the best the Listener can do?
Ugh!
Agh!
Oof!
Nyargh!
No!
"By Sithis, I'll see you dead!"
You won't get that lucky again!
Nyargh!
Agh!
Oof!
Ugh!
Precious release...
Father...
Ahhhhhhhh!
Yeeeaaahhh!
I... am... eternal...
Back... to... the Void...
"I return to you, Father."
Ahhhhh.....
Hhhhuuuuuhhh....
Aiiiieee!
Aiiiieee!
Aiiiieee!
Coming... Mother...
Well done...
Uhh.. thank you...
But... we had a deal...
"I can't believe you're speaking to me, after what you've done. You broke my heart."
We have nothing to talk about. I can't believe what you did to me.
Your words are cheap. Why should I speak to you after what you've done?
And why should I speak with you? You broke my heart.
You. You should just go. I don't have enough ale to stomach talking to you.
"Look at you. Come crawling back, after everything you've done to me?"
What do you want? There's no words left to say to each other.
"All right, just because it's you, we'll try again."
"I'll give you another chance, but watch yourself."
"You want to try again? Fine, but I'll be watching you carefully."
"Try again? You and me? Fine, but I've got my eyes on you."
"You're testing my patience, but very well. I'll give you another chance."
"All right, we'll start again, but watch yourself."
Get out of my sight!
Get out of here. Get out of here and never come back!
What did you say? Get out of my sight!
You're a monster. Leave and never come back!
What'd you say to me? Get out! I never want to see you again.
You come all this way just to hurt me a second time? Get out of my sight!
Leave. Now!
I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years.
It's not like my poaching is hurting anyone. The Jarl can hardly eat every deer now can he?
There's enough for all of us if you aren't greedy.
"Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold."
"This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor."
"This woman has endured, has challenged, and has shown her valor."
Who will speak for him?
Who will speak for her?
I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.
Would you raise your shield in his defense?
Would you raise your shield in her defense?
"I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us."
"I would stand at her back, that the world might never overtake us."
And would you raise your sword in his honor?
And would you raise your sword in her honor?
It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.
It stands ready to meet the blood of her foes.
And would you raise a mug in his name?
And would you raise a mug in her name?
I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.
I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in her stories.
Then the judgment of this Circle is complete.
His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
Her heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
"Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call."
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
"Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint."
"Well, girl, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint."
Mirabelle will be waiting for you.
My son? Erik? What about him? Did something happen? Is he alright?
But the world is a dangerous place. Erik has no idea what he's getting himself into.
"What's more, he's got no armor. I'll have to save up the money for it."
You would give your own coin to help my son? I'm moved by your compassion.
"Your kind deed will not go unrewarded, my friend. Tell Erik I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor."
"I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather not be in debt to a stranger."
"Ah, I see. I've just remembered that I saved a few septims in case of an emergency. This is starting to feel like one."
"Tell Erik that I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor. And please don't hurt me!"
"Go ahead, hit me as often as you want. It's not going to change anything, other than to make me and the town guard angry."
"I... I cannot deny the truth of what you say. Erik is all the family that I have left, but it's wrong to hold him back as I have."
Go and tell Erik that I've changed my mind. I'll see about borrowing some money in Whiterun for his armor.
Perhaps you should let a father decide what is best for his own son.
"I welcome you, friend. How may I serve you?"
So many refuse to talk to us. They call us thieves and smugglers. I am glad to see that you are not such a one.
"Welcome. If I cannot serve you, I am sure that one of my other traders can do so."
I have traveled far across Tamriel to serve you.
"Perhaps you have encountered Ma'dran or Akhari? Both are sworn to me, and both have worthy goods to offer."
The road makes this one weary.
The wind blows bitter cold in this place.
"The longer we travel the roads of Skyrim, the more empty this land seems."
The warm sand of Elsweyr is far away from here.
The roads of Skyrim lead to many dangers.
We are creatures of the desert. The north wind chills us to the bones.
There is much beauty in this place.
How high the mountains of Skyrim rise!
A peaceful greeting to you.
"It is a strange sight, the white flakes that sometimes fall from the sky."
"The air is so clear in Skyrim, one can see forever."
"A welcome to you, fellow traveler."
"Khajiit welcomes you, and also your coin."
Do you seek to make a purchase?
"Khajiit has wares, if you have coin."
Fortune smiles upon this meeting.
Welcome to you.
"Warm sands, friend. How may this one serve you?"
"Please, come and browse our goods."
May your bed be warm and your food sweet.
You honor Khajiit with your presence.
"Many fine things are here for you, friend."
"Come and see what is for sale, traveler."
"May the sun warm your path, friend."
Speak to one of the others if you wish to buy something.
This Khajiit guards the others.
"Bring your coins, but do not bring trouble."
Khajiit is always watching for thieves and pickpockets.
Khajiit is ready for any troublemakers.
"If you have come to see our wares, speak to the others."
Welcome to Khajiit's humble camp.
"Khajiit is just a guard, and has no wares to sell."
"Blessings of the moons upon you, traveler."
"Some come to buy, but others come to steal. Khajiit shows no mercy to thieves."
"Khajiit are not welcome in the cities, so we make our camps outside the walls."
There is no trust for Khajiit in this place.
Soon it will be time to replenish our supply of water.
The road takes us past many cold rivers. We can fill our skins there.
"If the river is not frozen to ice, perhaps."
My bones ache for the moonsugar. It has been too long since I tasted it.
You know that our supply is limited. It could be a season or more before we get a new shipment from the south.
"My ears hear the truth in your words, and yet my body shakes with the need."
Control yourself! Do not frighten away our customers with your fits.
"Yes, of course you are right. Still, I would give much for even a few grains of moonsugar."
"Put the thought out of your mind, and do not speak of it again."
"It has been a profitable journey, and yet I long for the warm sands of Elsweyr more and more each day."
I feel the same. I do not think Khajiit were made for the cold.
"Not only that, but these Nords have no love for us. They look upon us and see only thieves and smugglers."
"It is a pity, but it cannot be helped. Perhaps if we continue to show that we can be trusted, they will open their cities to our caravans."
Hah! I wish that I had your optimism.
"We have been in this land for so long, I have forgotten what it feels like to walk on warm sand."
"Yes, I know just what you mean. My toes are numb from the cold more often than not."
Do you ever find that you regret making this journey?
"In truth, I do not. I have always dreamed of seeing new lands, and it does not hurt that we are making a good profit."
That is true. Perhaps I should be more grateful for this opportunity. Not many Khajiit can say that they have visited Skyrim.
All this talk of dragons returning to the world makes me more than a little nervous.
Moons protect us! I hope we do not encounter one of them on the road.
"I suppose if we do, we will find out just how fast each of us can run."
"As the saying goes, you do not need to be faster than the dragon; you need only be faster than your friends."
Do you believe all this talk of dragons? Can the ancient ones truly have returned?
"I wish I could say that I did not, but in every part of Skyrim, there is talk of dragon sightings. It is no coincidence."
"S'rendarr be merciful! What ill fortune that this should happen now, while we are trying to make a living."
"We are fortunate. We travel lightly, and can escape at a moment's notice. We have no home that a dragon can burn to the ground."
"I feel pity for these Nords. When the dragons attack cities and towns, they will lose everything."
"And we will lose customers. Let us hope that if there are dragons, there are only a few and they are not too foul-tempered."
I wonder if we should offer discounts to the soldiers.
"The soldiers? From which side, the Stormcloaks, or the Imperials?"
"Both. One or the other is bound to win the war eventually. Why not curry favor now, so that the victor will look upon us kindly?"
"Hah, you have the foresight of a Khajiit in a sandstorm. If we offer a discount to both sides, the winners will persecute us for helping the losers."
Hm. I had not thought of it that way.
"Between the war and the return of the dragons, I wonder if we should not leave Skyrim and ply our trade elsewhere."
"I admit, the dragons are a concern, but we can avoid them if we do not stay in one place for too long."
"That may be, but what of the war? That is not so easy to escape from."
"The war? That is not a reason to leave, it is a reason to stay."
And what makes you think that?
"Because war is good for business, of course."
Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and that was in Mercer's company.
"If you can get past his trained watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second floor balcony in his backyard."
No. It's some sort of crazy contraption Mercer commissioned for quick escapes.
I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would lower it in a hurry.
"That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one."
"Mercer's holding something over his head, keeping him loyal."
Talk to Vex. She used to know him very well... if you catch my meaning.
"That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know."
Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person.
The only thing Vald understands is gold. A man after my own heart.
"Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray Mercer Frey."
"Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the details."
"Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need off of his corpse... I could care less."
Of mine? What is it?
"No visitors. No way. Now piss off, before ya' make me mad."
I can't believe it! How did ya' talk her into this?
"Never mind, I don't care. I'm just glad I don't gotta' work for Maven anymore."
"Here, ya' did me a favor, I guess I owe you one."
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away unless ya' can talk Maven Black-Briar into letting me outta' my debt.
"You try and set one foot in this yard, and I'll cut it off."
It's just across the bridge and up that hill.
We're close now. I can see the camp.
My men? What did you do? You'll die for this.
"Wait, it's haunted? I don't like ghosts... let me think about this for a minute..."
Why don't you go in there and get it?
Hmm....
Wait... who in blazes is this?
"Oh! Um, he he... Hold on... I... I can explain..."
"Valmir, you rat. You're not a soldier at all! Must be one of the Thalmor!"
"I'm a Forsworn. One of our raids went bad, and I got captured."
"Would've been fine dying for the Reach with my kinsmen, but the Silver-Bloods want their ore mined, so they threw me in here."
Murder. Banditry. Assault. Theft. And lollygagging.
"Year seven, I think? Surprised I haven't cut my own throat out by now, but something keeps me going."
Guards brought me in about 12 years ago. Was running a good group of bandits up until then.
But these Forsworn. They're nothing like the men I cobbled together. They're real killers.
"Guards say I murdered someone. I was just sleeping off some mead in my aunt's house, but that didn't stop them from arresting me."
I don't even know who they said I killed.
"A couple of years? I wasn't a Forsworn when I came, but I joined up when I got in. Easier that way."
Don't want to talk about it.
Long enough.
The first time? Thieving. The second time? Thieving. The third time? Thieving. It kind of keeps going like that.
"First it was 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Now I'm in for life."
"Yes, you certainly do."
"You'll be going back to the College, then? I, uhh... I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself."
"Let this whole thing blow over, you know. Give certain parties a chance to forget what I may have done."
"Still, you've gotten me out of that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to you."
"Have the books, do you? I mean, I'm very glad. That's wonderful."
"You could, you know, let me out of this cage now."
"The undercroft is ahead... ugh, Necromancers. Be careful."
The library is just through here. We're getting close now.
And the outpost at Dragon Bridge?
It'll be shuttered by the end of the month.
"Very good. And you'll be returning to... Well, if you don't mind me asking, where exactly will you be going now, sir?"
"Hmph. Now there's an excellent question. An excellent question, indeed. Truth is, as soon as the Emperor sets sail,  I'm resigning my position."
"Oh... I see. Well then, let me be just say that it's been an honor serving under you Commander Maro."
"The honor has been mine. You should be proud of what we've accomplished here. The Dark Brotherhood is no more. And the Emperor, finally, is safe."
Yes sir.
"And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could."
"My uncle Dengeir was Jarl until a short time ago. His old age and failing health caught up with him, and he stepped down."
"He now serves us honorably as Thane, and to the great benefit of the hold, I now serve as Jarl."
Karliah's been through here. What does she expect to find?
The stench in here... this place smells of death. Be on your guard.
"Pull the chain over there, and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all of the traps."
There's two more of them ahead.
Bone chimes... clever. Rigged to wake the draugr I'd bet. Don't blunder into any of them.
Karliah always was a nimble minx... slipping passed these draugr must be child's play for her.
We're on the right track. She's been through here as well.
"Difficult? I am a Jarl. I eat the most succulent meat, drink the finest ale and hunt with the best hounds in the hold."
"Meanwhile, my very capable steward sees to the needs of the smallfolk and ensures that my hold runs smoothly."
Being a Jarl could hardly be simpler. You should try it sometime.
"It was Dengeir who made me a steward, long ago when he was young."
"When Dengeir's health began to fail, young Sidgeir was appointed Jarl in his stead. It was simpler just to keep me as steward."
"Sidgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly."
"Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these."
"In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here."
"Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life."
That door up ahead... looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.
Leave this place... Leave this place...
We've been awaiting your return.
He'll answer any questions you have.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get him killed.
She'll answer any questions you have.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get her killed.
Ysgramor was the hero who started the Companions. Wuuthrad was his weapon.
He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves.
"But not all of them, because some of them are still here."
It was the blade hefted by Ysgramor when he returned to drive the elves out of the old Skyrim.
"Without that axe, this whole land would be overrun still."
"Wuuthrad is a relic of Ysgramor. Through that weapon, we trace our line straight to the first harbinger of makind in this land."
"What fragments we have are displayed in honor, but we always seek more."
I watch you to make sure you are honorable.
"If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you brother."
I watch you to make sure you are honorable.
"If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you sister."
I would hope that's obvious.
"Do well here, and you'll be a full member of the Companions."
"Fail, and it won't matter anyway."
Bad people who don't like werewolves.
So they don't like us either.
A group of werewolf hunters who have gotten wise to our little secret.
"They've made it their mission to hunt us down, but we are hunters ourselves."
"Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody."
"Not all of us, just the members of the Circle. We shouldn't be talking about this anyway."
Fascinating! Original Akaviri bas-reliefs... almost entirely intact!
"Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead."
"We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?"
Amazing... you can see how the Akaviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...
"She sold the city out to the Aldmeri Dominion. Were it not for her betrayal, Taneth could have held its ground in the war."
The other noble houses discovered her betrayal and she fled. They want her brought back alive.
"The resistance against the Dominion is alive and well in Hammerfell, and they want justice."
You have? Where? Tell me now!
"Money, if that is what you wish."
Now tell me where she is!
"We cannot go after her, not without drawing attention."
You must bring her to us.
"Lead her to the Whiterun stables, outside of the city. We will wait for you there."
"All right, Delvin. What gives with that case of Shadowbanish you sold me?"
What do you mean? That wine tastes finer than anythin' Surilie Brothers ever made.
"Sure, it tastes great. Only one problem. You said it can make the darkness as clear as day when you drink it. Guess what? It doesn't."
"Am I responsible if the vintage was off on that case? Sorry, you know the rules Vekel. No refunds."
"Puttin' together another shipment from Morrowind, Vekel. Lookin' for anythin' special?"
"Well, if some Moon Sugar should fall into your lap..."
Maybe. That stuff's gettin' tough to bring across the border with all the Argonian patrols.
"Well if it turns up, I'll be willing to buy."
"You need to tell your boys to place nice, Delvin. Almost threw two of them into the well last night."
They aren't my boys. Do I look like the leadin' type?
"You know what I mean. Tell your boss that rough is rough, but when someone pulls a dagger fun time is over."
I'll pass it along.
Good news. I found that dwarven hammer you were looking for.
You did? Thanks. I get you the rest of your coin by tomorrow.
"Yeah, funny thing about that. The price was a hundred higher than I expected."
"Vekel, you have no shame. I'll get you the rest like I said. I want that hammer."
Why can't you just settle down and run the Flagon with me?
I don't want to settle. I like things the way they are.
"Come on, Ton. Marry me. Let me take care of you."
I can take care of myself.
How dare you! After all we've been through together? How can you do this to me!
"Look, I need to know. What's going on between you and Brynjolf?"
That's all they are... rumors. So quit worrying.
"I need you to do me a favor, Dirge."
"Sure, Ton. You know I'm good for it."
There's a new guard nosing around the meadery. Can you do something about it?
"Gladly. He won't bother you anymore, I promise."
"Please milady, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?"
"Please my lord, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?"
"Please help me, I'm starving."
"Please, I don't have anything to eat."
Can you spare any coin?
Spare a septim?
Go away.
"Edda, you know well I barely have any coin to call my own. I'm sorry."
"You must be starving. Here, spend it well."
"All right, all right. Here."
"Yes, I hope this helps."
"Yes, of course. This war is causing your woes, it's hardly your fault."
"Certainly, good lady. Here."
Are you joking? Go earn a living and stop loafing!
"I would if I could, but I can barely make ends meet."
"Here, this should help."
"Of course, here. Be well."
Maybe you should look for work instead of begging for coin.
Here you are.
Oh you poor thing! Come by the temple and my husband and I will keep you fed.
"Edda, Edda. There's no need for this. Just come by the temple and we'll care for you."
"Sorry, all out of coin."
"I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. Leave me alone."
"Ugh, you reek. Get out of my way."
"Here you go, dear."
"Oh, very well. Just try and clean yourself up."
"Get away from me, you filthy woman."
Spare a coin?
"If you could spare a septim, I'd be grateful."
"Help out an old man here with some coin, would you?"
"Hey, can I get a gold or two?"
I could sure use some coin.
No. Now shove off.
"Snilf, it's me. I don't have a roof over my head either, remember?"
Oh if only I could provide more than this coin. I hope it'll do.
Again? Buy some food this time will you?
"Yes, I hope this helps."
"Another uncounted causality of this war. Here you are, you poor man."
"Certainly, my good man. Here."
"You're disgusting, stay away from me."
"If I had even a pot to piss in, I'd gladly share. Sorry."
"Yes, I hope this helps you."
Absolutely. Here you are. Be well.
"Ugh, you smell horrible. Get yourself cleaned up."
"Very well, here."
"Oh you poor thing, you must be starving. Come to the temple later and let us feed you."
"Snilf, I told you begging isn't the answer. I expect to see you at the temple later."
"Sorry, no time. I'm late."
"If you want to awaken from your next slumber, I suggest you leave me be."
What? No. Get away from me.
I suppose. Just get something to eat and stay away from the Bee and Barb for a change.
"Very well, please use it for food."
Never. Now move aside.
"That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle, your blood must be as ours."
Meet us here when you're ready.
Why are the potions I requested not completed?
"I'm sorry, milady. The components for those elixirs are quite volatile and in some cases, very dangerous to handle. I must take care."
"Excuses are not acceptable in my court. When I ask for something I expect results, and I expect them immediately."
"Yes, milady. Sorry, milday. They will be completed."
"There's still the matter of the prisoner to discuss. Now, his family is willing to contribute handsomely if we release him."
The execution will proceed as planned.
"But, mother... this is quite a sizable contribution and the crime doesn't befit such a harsh punishment."
"Are you going soft on me, Hemming? Perhaps I made the wrong choice installing you as steward."
"No, mother. The execution will proceed as planned."
"Hemming, have you dispatched that letter I gave you yesterday?"
"Yes, and I sent it with our fastest courier and under the cover of night, exactly as you specified."
"Good. If I need to light a few fires in order to get what we need to defend this place from the Stormcloaks, so be it."
"I'm almost certain he'll reach the Imperial City tomorrow, so we should have an answer by the end of the week."
Any word about our little problem in the Ratway?
I've spoken to Brynjolf and he assures me it'll be taken care of.
"Next time you speak to him, tell him to clean up his own messes. I'm not about to jeopardize this position for a bunch of low-life thugs."
I'll let him know.
Your mother seems to have taken to her seat quite well.
"Yes, she's been grooming herself for this for quite a long time."
It's surprising the Council is allowing a Nord rule Riften under the Imperial flag. That can't be their first choice.
Let's just say my mother knows which pockets to line and keep it at that.
"So, have you thought about what I said?"
"I find the concept of sleeping with you not only repulsive, but morally unsettling. Does that answer your question?"
You listen to me. I'd be careful wagging that pretty little tongue at me like that otherwise I may just have it cut off.
Just stay away from me and maybe I won't weave a spell to shrink something that matters to you.
"Maul, can I ask a personal favor of you?"
"Well that depends on what the favor is, now doesn't it."
It's Hemming. He's making advances and I can't bear the man's presence. Is there anything you can do?
"I'll talk to him, but he's stubborn. He's like his mother; he sees what he wants and he won't quit until he has it."
Anything you can do to keep his filthy hands off of me would be a welcome change.
My agents are telling me that we've appropriated the caravan from Hammerfell... with minimal losses.
"For what it's costing me, I should be handed the merchandise on a silver platter."
"The coin isn't just for the men, there's a lot of people that need to be compensated in order to make this happen."
And a hefty cut for yourself too I'm sure. Just see to it the items are secured and the rest disposed of properly this time.
"I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point."
"Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones."
This is an utter waste of time.
Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!
"Very well, I'll keep practicing them."
"Ingun, you clumsy fool! You've tainted our entire supply of Painted Troll Fat. You have no idea how hard that was to get."
I'm sure my mother can compensate you for it.
"I'll draft a letter to Rythe. If you could have it sent to Cheydinhal for me, that would make up for your blunder."
I'll make sure it's sent right away.
"Niluva, you promised me you'd pay me back yesterday. So what's the story?"
Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.
"If you'd stop wasting your coin on that skooma, you'd have enough gold to live on."
"Sorry, Tythis. I'll get it to you somehow."
"How do you do it, Valindor? How do you work at Black-Briar Meadery and the Fishery without getting exhausted?"
"Oh, it's not so terrible. I actually find the work quite relaxing."
Relaxing? They must be working you to the bone! You should rest before you do yourself in.
"Not to worry, dear Svana. I promise you I can handle it, but your concern is quite flattering."
"Wujeeta, you really need to stop using that skooma. It's very bad for your health and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to you."
"I can't, Valindor. It won't let me go. It's taking over my life."
It's an evil substance. Whoever's selling it to you should be brought to justice.
"If there was any justice in the world, I'd just get this over with and die peacefully."
"Wujeeta, you're worrying me. You look so... well, so sad."
"Don't worry about it, Svana. It's my problem... no need for you to get involved."
"Look, if you're in some sort of trouble, I could talk to Haelga."
"No, no... please, I'm just tired is all. Thank you."
So how are things with you and Bolli?
How do you think? He's a pig. All I am to him is a warm body to lay with.
Nivenor! How can you say that? He gives you everything you ask for.
"If I cared for your opinion on our affairs, I'd ask. Now, if you'll excuse me."
You found it? I've been looking for that blade for months. You took on all those bandits yourself?
"Thank you. Here, my father had a favorite sword and shield technique. Let me teach it to you, in honor of his memory."
"Bless you, friend. You have renewed my hope."
"Before I came into Zenithar's calling, I confess I was a thief. But I learned a few things in my time that might help you survive. Let me show you."
"You mean... there's still a chance? But how? Our plan has gone to ruin, everyone is dead, the Family..."
"Ah, yes, I can imagine you'd want to settle that score. Last I heard he was at the Solitude Docks, conducting the Emperor's departure."
The poor child is probably beggin' for us to string up her murderin' father.
Best tell the Jarl.
The spirit world is strong in this place.
Look to the graveyard. That is where you'll find her.
You saw her ghost?
I'm glad it was you and not me.
She's buried outside of town. That's where I'd look.
"Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that."
Here's your share. Nicely done.
"Bunch of foreign troublemakers. Wandering around, getting into mischief, scaring the citizens."
"They've been told to stay out of the city, but keep trying to get back in."
"Ooh, you're a wizard! I mean, you cast that spell just now, yeah? I was hoping you could make me invisible or something. Can you? Make me invisible?"
Awww. And here I thought you could do it...
"Well, I'll just have to think of something else then. Bye."
Really? I mean... I still feel like I'm here.
"Okay, great!"
Now I'm finally going to have some fun around here.
Bye!
"Okay, great!"
Now I'm finally going to have some fun around here.
Bye!
You're dumb.
All right! I knew you'd do it. This is going to be so fun. You can't even imagine!
I can't wait to be invisible.
Come on. Hurry it up already. The waiting is killing me.
Hey... So are you ever going to make me invisible or what?
Boo! Ahahahaha!
Oooooh... weeeeoooooo....
That's right. Who's invisible? Me!
Surprise! Ahaha!
Really? I dunno... I don't feel invisible.
"You disrespected the Brotherhood. And it'll cost you. You want back into the Family, you pay the price. 500 gold, and all is forgiven."
"You may be Listener, and head of the Sanctuary, but your recent behavior sets a bad example. I must insist you pay a fine of 300 gold."
"If the Tenets were still in place, you would be required to defeat the Wrath of Sithis. Now you just need to pay a fine to Nazir. Ah, the Old Ways..."
"When you disrespect your Family, you disrespect yourself. Don't you care for anything at all? Prove that you do - speak with Nazir, make reparations."
"Bah. If it were up to me, we'd cut off your hands and never let you back in this Sanctuary. But no. All you have to do is pay Nazir a fine. Pathetic."
"Ah, don't worry, we all like to break the rules sometimes. Just see Nazir and pay the fine. Seems I do that at least once a month..."
"There are so few rules here. All we ask is that you don't disrespect your Family. But for some reason, you have. Best talk to Nazir and pay the fine."
"Idiot. I may not have a lot of rules, but that doesn't give you free reign to do as you please. You want to resume your duties? Go talk to Nazir."
"Oh, but Cicero can't talk to you. You've been naughty, naughty. I think you need to clear this whole mess up with Nazir."
"Looks like Cicero's not the only only one to go a little crazy from time to time. Eh, Listener? You should talk to Nazir, work this whole mess out."
"With all due respect, Listener, you broke what few rules we seem to have. Nazir insists you talk to him and work this issue out."
"I do apologize, Listener, but Nazir made it clear the initiates are not to speak with you until you first deal with him, and atone for your actions."
Good. I'll spread the word that you've made reparations. Now let's forget the past and get back to business...
"Excellent. Now we can get back to business. I think it's best we just forget this ever happened and move on, hmm?"
"Then I suggest you [QUOTE]collect[QUOTE] it. Until you pay the fine, you are effectively cut off from all Dark Brotherhood duties and contracts."
"Not ready? Well, my arrogant little sibling, until you pay the fine the Dark Brotherhood holds nothing for you. No contracts. No rewards. No respect."
"I understand, Listener. And I hope you understand that until the fine is paid, I must insist you refrain from all Dark Brotherhood business."
My pa always warned me about these things!
Damn dustmen! Why don't you stay dead?
Just what I was afraid of!
Damn dustmen!
Why don't you stay dead?
Look out! Draugr!
It must be the Stormcloaks! Find them!
Look out! Draugr!
It's got to be the Imperials! Find them!
Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else.
"I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it."
"He didn't say, but you'd better move fast."
"There's probably something I could find for you to do, but best to check with him."
"I don't know, but he sounded impatient."
"I did. Your time, it seems, has come."
"Yes, and we have something special for you this time."
Last week a scholar came to us. He said he knew where we could find another fragment of Wuuthrad.
"He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right, the honor of the Companions demands that we seek it out."
"Aela will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp."
"Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp."
So I'm told. Try and keep up.
So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.
"Ah, you're back."
Me? I'm Burguk's brother. I came back after serving many years in the Legion.
"By then, Burguk had already become chief, and he welcomed me home as family, not a rival as is tradition."
"I did. I was known as Ghorbash gro-Dushnikh in those days, in honor of my homeland."
"Many Orcs leave the stronghold to join the Legion. They welcome our skill in battle and smithing, and we welcome a chance to see the world."
I do. There is a freedom the roads give you that the stronghold does not.
"But I have a place here, and I wouldn't want to dishonor my clan by leaving again like some young pup."
I couldn't. It would dishonor the place the chief has made for me.
"You're right. Look at me, talking in circles like some old wise woman. Very well, outlander. You have my axe when you need it."
"Yes, but I am honor-bound to stay here."
"Well, for that much, I don't think Malacath would turn his scowl on me. All right, outlander. My axe is yours."
"My honor isn't so cheap, outlander."
"I'm not a coward, outlander. You want me to prove it? Fine. My axe is yours. To the most dangerous corners of Skyrim and back."
As you wish.
"I am Larak's daughter. Soon, I'll be of age and will be sent to marry an Orc chief in some distant stronghold."
"Until then, I train. My new home will need strength, and my new sisters must know I am not weak when I arrive."
No. A chief's daughter marries who her chief wishes. It ensures the stronghold receives a fair trade in goods for my absence.
"I used to look forward to the day when I was of age, to see new places and people, but now it feels like a cage."
"Yes, but I must stay here and wait for the day when I'll be married and sent to another stronghold."
"It is our way, and I am proud to follow my people's traditions, but I can't help but feel chained."
I couldn't. It would shame my chief and my mother and foremothers.
You're right. Malacath teaches us to meet our fate. Perhaps this is mine.
"What do you know about my people, outlander?"
No mercy!
Bring it on!
Gettin' to old for this.
You're mine!
I'll cut your throat!
Come on!
You've breathed your last!
Your end is near!
Out of my way!
You mean nothing!
Your life is mine!
You're making this too easy!
Your fate is sealed!
"Nocturnal, guide my hand!"
Dodge this!
Darkness consume you!
Shadows take you!
Is that all you've got?
You fight like a child!
Ha! You're pathetic!
"Die, damn you!"
"Come on, put up a fight!"
Give up?
Yeargh!
Rargh!
Hyargh!
Nyargh!
Yiiee!
Hunh!
Die!
Grrarrgh!
"Die, insect!"
I will end you!
You're as good as dead!
You're... dead!
"Fall, damn you!"
Agggh!
Come on!
I... Willl... kill you!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You're pathetic!
Talos smite you!
Talos smite you!
Die dog!
Hahaha!
On your knees!
Take that!
Die!
Yeeeaarrggh!
Hhyyaarrgghh!
Nnnnyyaarrgghh!
Rrargh!
Hrargh!
Unnff!
Nuhn!
Aggh!
Oof!
Arrggh!
Gah!
Hunh!
Wagh!
Unh!
No...
Enough of this!
"Damn it, no more!"
I'll... get you...
I'm not done yet...
Gods... the pain...
You'll... pay for this...
Noooo....
Shadows take me...
Aghh..
I don't have time for this.
There's no need to hide. I won't hurt you.
"Come out and face me, you coward!"
I can smell your fear.
I can hear your heart beating.
Hiding? The shadows are my domain!
Hiding only prolongs the inevitable.
I know you're here. Show yourself.
I'll find you... it's only a matter of time.
Coward. Come out and fight me!
"Come on, show yourself!"
I'm going to find you...
Hm? Something's near...
"Wait, I hear something..."
I heard something.
Who's there?
What was that?
Time to fight!
Finally! Let's end this.
There you are!
Your feeble attempt to hide is insulting!
You can't hide from me!
"Enough games, let's end this!"
"Come coward, now we fight!"
I knew I heard something!
Now you're mine!
You've got moments to live.
I'm endin' you right now!
"Sure, pick on the old guy!"
"Come on, I won't bite."
Let's get this party started.
Been itching for a fight.
I promise a swift but painful end!
No mercy for the weak!
I'll give no quarter!
"So, it's to the pain then!"
"Ah good, I could use some practice!"
I'll tear you apart!
The burden of death approaches!
"Come, taste darkness's embrace!"
Your life is forfeit!
I bring death from the shadows!
"By Nocturnal's grace, I will defeat you!"
I'll bury my blade in your heart!
Your death will be my triumph!
You're not a threat... merely an annoyance.
You've just written your own epitaph.
Your blood will adorn my blade!
This shouldn't take long.
"So, it begins."
Where'd you come from?
Hey!
Talos smite you!
Sovngarde awaits!
This should be fun!
For the Emperor!
Die villain!
I'll enjoy killing you!
Guess it was nothing after all.
I must've been hearing things.
They picked on the wrong old man.
Haven't fought like that in years.
That was fun.
Waste of time.
Didn't even work up a sweat.
Pathetic.
That's what happens when you cross the Guild.
I think they got the message.
"Damn, just as I was getting warmed up."
I hardly felt a thing.
And that's why I'm the best.
The afterlife will bring you darkness.
"Bless you, Lady of Shadows... I live another day."
I send you to your rest.
You were no match for a Nightingale.
Shadows consume you.
"That wasn't a fight, it was an execution."
So ends the lesson.
That was hardly worth my time.
How disappointing.
Hmph. Hardly a challenge.
That'll teach you to cross me.
That's the end of that.
"Oh come now, resorting to petty tricks are we?"
A bold but foolish move.
Coward.
You cannot escape!
Where'd you go?
Come back here!
Where are you?
You can't hide forever!
You can't get away from me!
Show yourself!
No one here now.
Must've scared 'em off.
Enough of this! Fight me!
"So, you reveal yourself!"
You can't hide from me!
Now you die!
There you are!
"Ha, found you!"

"That is a fine idea. The stronghold would need the gold when I left to marry, anyway. I am ready when you are."
No. That won't be enough.
"I am not weak. Very well, outlander, I will go with you whenever you are ready."
You dare challenge a child of Malacath?
Thank you for asking.
"You wouldn't be a sellsword, would you? I have a little problem you could solve."
"I used to be an adventurer in my day, then I settled down. Got married."
I may have accidentally let a prisoner escape. The leader of one of those bandit groups.
"I told everyone he died during questioning, and I need you to track him down and make sure he doesn't show up to disprove that."
That's right. Used to explore all over. I'm the one who originally found the mine Darkwater Crossing was built around.
"I was actually scouting a bit the other day, old times sake. Spied a brigand heading back to his camp."
"Up for a little hunting? My husband is being a sad stick, so I can't go myself."
"Whenever a group of marauders attack a Nord village, Ulfric is the first to sound the horn and send the men."
"But a group of Dark Elf refugees gets ambushed? A group of Argonians, or a Khajiit caravan? No troops. No investigation. Nothing."
"There's a group of cutthroats out there right now that Ulfric doesn't lift a finger to bring to justice, as long as they don't threaten Nord land."
Good. I'll have a sack of coin waiting for you when you get back.
This brings back memories. Come back when you're done and maybe I'll be up to showing you a few tricks.
That's a brave offer. I'd be happy to throw in my coin behind that.
"You deal with them, I'll make sure you get paid. Maybe this old soldier will throw in some lessons as well."
Suit yourself.
Fair enough.
Yes. It is.
That's a load off my mind. Here's your pay.
You remind me of myself a few years ago. Let me show you a little bit about wearing light armor. It's helped me out whenever I was scouting.
"Now I've got the itch to travel again. If you're leaving town, I wouldn't mind coming with for a while."
"Now that's good work. Everyone will be a lot safer with them gone, Dark Elf and Nord alike."
"Here, some gold as promised, and let me show you a bit about wearing heavy armor. Save you some aches on a long march."
My husband. We used to go out in the wilds and collect ingredients together. He used to call me his [QUOTE]pretty Juniper.[QUOTE]
"It's quite romantic, if you're an alchemist. Frost took the old fool a few seasons back, while he was looking for the Ring of Pure Mixtures."
"I found the ring's resting place after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now."
"I am. I came into Arkay's light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics."
I'm fortunate that Kust and the people of Falkreath have come to accept me as one of their own.
Could you do an old elf a favor? I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return.
"I was the finest scout in the Legion, once. Tracked down all the places in the wilds that were causing people trouble."
"Lost my helmet in one of the old caves. My pretty, pretty helmet. Life just got worse after that. Kept losing things. So many things...."
"Yes. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here."
Legend says that my forefather Lenne discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead.
"Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe."
"Of course I am. What do I look like, a tavern wench?"
"Ah, don't let my words cut you too deep. I've just been working the forge too hard. Trying to set this sword right."
"Well, aren't you sweet? I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me."
Blessing of Arkay to you for your help.
"Oh, you could? I sure would love to have it again. Could show you some of my old scouting tricks."
"According to my grandfather at least. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into."
"Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques."
"Jarl wants it to look like an ancient blade. High Queen Freydis ruled over Windhelm in the Second Era, and her sword was legendary."
"Getting the real sword would be even better than making a copy, but no one wants to risk getting it from its resting place."
"If you find that sword, traveler, I'd be grateful."
Why am I not surprised?
Very well.
So many things lost....
"Well, I never claimed otherwise."
Pfft. Ungrateful milk drinker.
"Thank you. Here, let an old alchemist pass on some of her secrets to you."
"Thank you. It's a collection of regrets that I try not to forget. Here, I promised you this."
"Look at it. That's real Nord craftsmanship, that is! Let me show you an old trick I learned as a scout. Makes it harder for the enemy to notice you."
My clan's shield. So Lenne really did stumble into that cave and was eaten by monsters.
"In honor of his memory, let me show you a few shield techniques. And tell me if you're leaving town. Be good to travel again."
Look at that edge. Still sharp.
"I'll present this to the Jarl later. As for you, let me show you some smithing techniques."
I've finally found you! I want to join the College of Winterhold. But I need help with my wards. Can you teach me?
Oh. All right... I guess I'll just keep practicing on my own. Sorry to bother you.
"Really? Great! Okay. So, first, you raise your ward and I'll throw a little spell at it. That way I can see the [QUOTE]right[QUOTE] way to do things."
Get your ward ready.
Great! Now I'm going to cast some spells at you. Keep your ward up so I can study it.
I think I see what I was doing wrong...
Come on. I don't want to hit you until you have your ward ready.
All right. That should do it. I think I'm ready to try the College again. Thanks!
We would but there's a big wedding taking place at Castle Dour. We'll have to wait until after the wedding.
Come back in a few nights when the wedding reception is over and we'll start the ceremony when you do.
Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar.
The Emissary? What's this about?
Wait... who are you? Intruder!
Well? Get out of here and mind your rounds.
"Please, cut me down!"
"You! Please, help me!"
"Hurry, cut me down!"
I want to get to my son. He's all I have left.
"That which is unknown can create unease, even fear. It is to be expected."
"Some fear our new resident wizard. As they grow to know him, they will accept him."
Time will prove me right.
Really? He's safe? Where is he?
"Mara's mercy, then he's safe! Come on, we have a lot to discuss."
What? You left him on his own? With the Thalmor after him? Go make sure he's safe and bring him here!
"So what are you doing here? Lorkhan's eyes, you can't let the Thalmor get to him first! Get back to Riften!"
Did you tell him you were Dragonborn? I didn't think so.
"Lorkhan's eyes, do I have to do everything myself? Get back to Riften before the Thalmor find him!"
"Hasn't she told you? We were both Blades, back when that still meant something."
"Now we're just fellow fugitives from the Thalmor. I didn't know she was still alive, but I'm not surprised. She was a survivor."
"Well. They've been hunting down Blades since the Great War, on general principle."
"But if you mean me, now, in particular... maybe they've started to get an inkling of what the return of the dragons means."
"I don't suppose they want the world to end any more than we do. Or at least, they'd prefer to end it on their terms."
Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!
"If we can just find out what this Dragonrend Shout is, you may have a chance."
Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.
Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!
"If we can just find out what Shout the ancient Nords used, you may have a chance."
Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.
"It's the prophecy, don't you see? Only a Dragonborn can stop Alduin and avert the end of the world!"
But... I don't yet know how you can stop him. The prophecy doesn't say. But Alduin's Wall does. I hope.
"Not yet, not yet. When we get to Riverwood... with Delphine... I'll tell you both then, when I've collected my thoughts."
"I never expected... well, suddenly here you are and now I'm too muddled to explain myself."
I still need some time to get used to the idea that there might be hope for us after all.
"Yes, yes, you're the new Family member. Let's make this easy - consider me the cranky old uncle nobody talks to. You go your way, I'll go mine."
"There you are! Astrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the ole' [QUOTE]Choose your victim[QUOTE] gag with you. Ah, I love that one..."
"Well, well. It's raw meat. Oh, my beautiful wife has told me all about you."
New brother. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
New sister. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
"Welcome, my brother. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you."
"Welcome, my sister. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you."
Hmph.
I'll give you a week before you end up dead in a ditch.
You certainly have a strange energy about you. I look forward to following your progress.
"You just trust in Astrid, follow her orders, and you'll do fine here."
"You're going to love it here. We have a lot of fun, and we look out for each other. Just like any family."
Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy.
"Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. [QUOTE]Ooh, you are such a pretty little girl. Would the sweetie like a sweetie? Oh yes, how about some chocolate?[QUOTE]"
"Oh yes, please, kind sir. My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley."
"Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth... your teeth! No! Aggghh!!"
"Oh Babette, but you are so wicked."
"What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?"
"Oh, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry..."
"Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know."
Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came [QUOTE]this[QUOTE] close to turning that priest inside out. Damned messy.
"And what of your latest, Arnbjorn. Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?"
"Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!"
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style."
But now he's dead... and I have a new loincloth.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
You call yourself a wizard? I challenge you to a duel!
I won't take no for answer!
The gods will be the judge of that.
Stop it! This is a one-on-one duel!
I thought you were a wizard. Hit me with a spell!
You're cheating!
It's no fun unless you fight me with magic.
"This is a magic duel. Ma-gic. You know, with spells."
That's better. Now we can talk.
The research I've done seems to indicate that Skorm Snow-Strider left part of his journal here after laying siege.
I believe it should indicate how to enter the blocked off sections of the stronghold.
"I should warn you, Forelhost is quite haunted, but I'm sure you can handle it. Return to me here once you've obtained the staff."
"Me? No, I'm too important to the war effort to risk life and limb in there... Besides, that's what I'm paying you for."
It seems that after the strength of the Cult was broken in the Dragon War a last contingent came here to create a stronghold and regroup.
"King Harald's forces crushed stragglers here the during the First Era and it has been haunted ever since, but the specifics of the siege are unclear."
They were among the first men to arrive from Atmora and they worshipped certain animals as avatars of the Gods; Dragons being foremost.
"And for their bloody sacrifices, the Dragons gifted their priests with terrible power."
"But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land."
Oh... well... of course they'd disavow all knowledge... spies are everywhere.
"I've just been asked enough questions. I'm here to learn, not to explain myself over and over."
"Forgive me, I didn't mean to assume."
"No, I suppose we haven't. Brelyna Maryon, of House Telvanni. First of my family to leave Morrowind in a long time."
Now I'm here to study Conjuration. That's what's important.
Didn't you know?
"Before the Oblivion Crisis, many elves called Winterhold their home. More visited the College from Morrowind every year."
"After, growing distrust of magic made life difficult for many. Some left rather than endure the growing hatred from the local Nords."
"Others returned home after the Red Year, when Vvardenfell erupted and caused much destruction."
Winterhold itself died in the years between then and now. What's left out there is a husk. Only the College really remains.
"You consider Restoration a valid school of magic, worthy of study, don't you? Don't you?"
"Good, good."
"Not that I require validation, of course. There are just some - and I shan't name names - who would disagree."
It can make life difficult when one's colleagues fail to recognize the research one engages in.
I... I see.
"Well, I'm glad we've established this early, rather than me hearing about it years or decades later when the whispers behind my back are loud enough."
"It's quite simple really. There are some who shall not be dignified by being named, who have implied that it is not."
"That is to say, it's been suggested that resources used for my study of Restoration could be put to better use. Any other use, in fact."
"It's not just healing cuts and bruises, you know. The undead are a very real, very dangerous threat and Restoration magics can keep them at bay."
Not to mention the benefit of wards! How can they continually overlook wards! It's baffling!
"Well... No. Not really. Not directly, I mean."
But I know things are said behind my back. Conversations cease when I enter rooms.
"I'm quite aware of what's going on here, and I will not stand for it!"
"You are now in the Arcanaeum, of which I am in charge. It might as well be my own little plane of Oblivion."
"Disrupt my Arcanaeum, and I will have you torn apart by angry Atronachs."
"Now, do you require assistance?"
"Of course I do. If I didn't, most of these books would've been burned to ashes or dissolved to nothing before the Third Era."
Mages need to be reminded to be careful around research materials.
A mage is only as good as what he knows. I try and make sure as much knowledge is available as possible.
"We've been keeping this collection since the Second Era. Books have come and gone during that time, but it's mostly intact."
"If you require assistance with summoning techniques, please let me know."
"If you would, please also contain your summons to the College grounds. The locals do not need to be agitated further by Atronachs roaming their town."
The summoning of undead is even less advisable outside of the College.
"By Sheor, no. Those archaic policies died out with the Mages Guild, and were never enforced here."
"Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used."
"Of course, non-mages may not see it that way, so we don't go around flaunting it."
Do not cross the bridge unaided!
"You risk death by doing so, and you shall not gain entry."
"You must first prove your worth, and then I shall lead you across."
"Dragons, is it? Does that make you the fabled [QUOTE]Dragonborn[QUOTE] we've heard mention of?"
You were just going to prove that you're Dragonborn.
Can you? You have the power of the Voice? Now I'm interested.
"By all means, show me."
"So you have the Voice, then? I would be quite impressed to see that."
You do indeed have the power. I'm impressed.
"Please, follow me. I'll escort you inside the College."
The key to wards is that they take time to charge.
"Not long, but you can't start casting with a fireball coming at you."
"Also, if your ward isn't negated by an incoming spell, it will recharge itself after a moment or two."
"Just be careful. Casting wards requires constant concentration, and you can easily find yourself drained of your magicka reserves."
Walk always in the shadow of Sithis.
May the shroud of death embrace you.
Darkness guide you.
Burn that little jester alive.
"Remember, fireballs. You can never go wrong."
"Go, incinerate some poor bastard for me."
"Yeah, yeah. Goodbye, kill lots of people, Hail Sithis, and all that."
Go. Do what has to be done.
Have fun!
Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.
Have a good contract.
"Kill well, and often."
"Just come back alive, and I'll be happy."
Go on now. Time to get your hands bloody.
"Take care of yourself, beef roast."
"Later, ham hock."
"Yeah, good luck."
"Represent us well, brother."
"Represent us well, sister."
"Remember, when you kill - we all wield the blade."
Watch yourself out there.
Cicero bids you... farewell.
"Oh, yes. Goodbye, goodbye."
"Farewell, farewell!"
"Until next time, brother."
"Until next time, sister."
Kill well. And often.
"Right, then."
Stay safe.
Only way you could have found one of those is by stealin' it. Guess you'll fit in around here better than I thought.
So what do you want to know?
"The name's Maul; I watch the streets for the Black-Briars. If you need dirt on anything, I'm your guy."
Do I look like a merchant to you? You're going to have to take that up with Vex in the Thieves Guild.
Get in good with them and you'll find her.
Not exactly. The crown is what the Guild calls a paragon; an object that enhances our thieving abilities.
"At least, that's what I'm told it does... there hasn't been a paragon in this Guild for hundreds of years."
"If we want to stay on top in Skyrim, the Guild needs that paragon back."
"Without it, we're just a bunch of petty thieves."
"When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power."
Dragons have always been able to Shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being.
"There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking."
"In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do."
"For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout."
"But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort."

Their Voices are too powerful for anyone not trained in the Way to withstand. Even a whisper could kill you.
"Five. Our leader, Paarthurnax, lives alone on the peak of the Throat of the World."
"When your Voice can open the path, you will know you are ready to speak to him."
"As I said, you will know you are ready when your Voice can open the path to him."
How can you just sit here and wait? We should be in there!
We must gather our strength. Who knows what's inside?
"Treasure, that's what! Get off your scaly rump and let's go."
"Hush, Salma. We aren't alone."
Too easy.
There's the Blades agent! Kill him!
There's the Blades agent! Kill her!
"If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do."
The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.
"Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?"
"No. And they're afraid of you, of your power."
"Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?"
What? You have it?
"No... No, as tempting as it is, it won't do to have both sides angry at us."
The College has had enough trouble staying out of the war. No need to make it worse.
You take that book to General Tullius or Ulfric and let them have their little triumph. It will be delivered back here to me soon enough.
"They live in seclusion near the top of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim."
They're masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting.
"It's a great honor for them to summon you. They speak to very few - in fact, they hardly speak at all."
No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons.
"You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear."
"The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do."
"Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods."
True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.
"In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance."
"We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller."
Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar.
"But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice."
"Sky above, Voice within."
Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days.
"We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though."
"For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do."
But we never found one. Until now.
"The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back."
There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.
I'm very dangerous! Don't make me come out there and hurt you!
"I'm not opening this door, so you might as well leave me alone."
"If my friends find out you've been bothering me, you'll be very sorry!"
Go away!
This one's mine.
Wind guide you.
Sky guard you.
Stand together and we shall defeat him!
There he is!
"No escape this time, foul worm!"
Careful!
Uh-oh.
This is not good.
Be careful. The Forsworn are just as dangerous as they look.
The roads just aren't safe these days.
I don't have time for this.
Where do they keep coming from?
Watch out. Wolves.
Should have picked somebody else for your dinner.
If that's the way you want it.
Good. I can use the practice.
Here we go.
Look out!
On guard!
Ah ha.
So it wasn't my imagination.
"Ach, there you are."
Aha.
I've got one!
Bad move.
This won't take long.
Too slow.
This is how it's done.
"Well, I guess you'll have to."
If you really think you can manage...
"I mean, I'd hate to leave now and find out later you met some horrible fate at the hands of the Caller."
"But if you insist, I suppose I'll be on my way. Thank you, and good luck."
"Yes, let's!"
"Really, I think there's been a mistake."
"May I just speak with her, please, to clear all this up?"
Just let me out of here. I only wanted to help you!
"Okay, now can you let me out? Please? I won't tell anyone it was you."
"Just open the cage, and I'll leave quietly. Won't make a sound, won't bother you at all."
Quiet down.
Stop your whining.
"She said you stay in there, and that's final."
I'll give you something to cry about if you don't quiet down.



"You just can't leave well enough alone, can you?"
And just what do you think you're doing?
"Unfortunately for you, we don't allow men into the inner sanctum."
"Unfortunately for you, we don't allow the uninitiated into the inner sanctum."
Indeed it is.
There are many valuable artifacts all through the temple.
"You have committed a breach, and must pay the penalty."
"Normally, a quick death."
"Normally, a period of servitude."
"Luckily for you, there are more pressing matters. We could make an example of you, but perhaps you could be put to better use."
The ceremony you so rudely interrupted was the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil.
I don't expect you to know what that means.
Suffice to say that our Sybil was recently lost to us.
"Through the Protocol, we have seen the home of the next Sybil, to the north, in a small village pressed against the stone."
"If you can travel there, and retrieve our young Sybil, your transgression will be forgiven."
So be it. We gave you a choice.
So be it. We gave you a choice.
We believe the place in our vision to be Karthwasten.
Now move quickly. The girl must be brought to the temple as soon as possible.
The sisters are communing with Dibella. They can't be disturbed.
You'll have to come back another time.
Why the drawn weapon? Is it contemplating violence?
"Neat weapon. You're not going to hurt anybody, though. Right?"
I trust you'll put your weapon away?
You planning on using that weapon?
Civilized people don't brandish their weapons unless they plan to use them.
"Umm... you're not planning on using that weapon, are you? At least not on me... right?"
You'd better know how to use that weapon if you plan on swinging it around in here.
Perhaps you'd care to put your weapon away? Hmm?
There a reason you're walking around with an unsheathed weapon?
This one wonders why you brandish your weapon so?
Might want to put it away that weapon... unless you plan on using it.
"You got no respect, strutting about with that weapon out, threatening everyone."
Dear. You should put that weapon away.
You got guts walking around with that weapon out. Looking for a fight? Is that it?
Put that thing away before someone gets hurt!
"Now, now... no need for weapons."
Nice weapon you have there. But I don't suppose you'd consider putting it away?
"What's this? Is it spoiling for a fight? If not, it should hide its weapon away."
You want to fight? That why you have your weapon out?
Wow. Nice weapon! Can I hold it? I promise not to break anything. Honest!
Put your weapon away.
"You're not planning on hurting anyone with that weapon there, are you?"
"So... carrying that weapon around like that makes you feel safe, does it?"
"Uh. Hey. That weapon there is just for show. Right? I mean, you aren't going to hurt me or anything... right?"
"In some parts of the world, wielding a weapon openly like that is an invitation to combat..."
"Ooh, real tough, wagging your weapon around..."
I suggest you put away your weapon. Wouldn't want to cause a... scene.
"You're not planning on using that weapon in here, I hope."
"That's mighty bold, strutting about like that, looking for a fight. This one will oblige if he must."
Oh ho! What's with the weapon? Looks like it's about to get rough in here.
"Damn fool parading around with your weapon out. You planning on hurting someone, huh?"
You're making people a bit nervous. Should consider putting that weapon away.
Ever see someone killed with their own weapon? Would you like to?
Walk into the the wrong place with your weapon drawn? You might not walk out again....
It's probably best if you put that weapon away.
Nice weapon you got there. Care to put it away?
"If you cause problems, I'll have to ask you to leave."
You're making my patrons nervous. Put the weapon away.
Put that thing away. You're making people nervous.
"We've all seen your little weapon. We're impressed. Now, please put it away."
It's time to put the weapon away now. Thank you.
"It is making patrons nervous. It needs to put the weapon away, now."
You. Weapon. Away. Now!
"You can bring weapons in, but you can't use 'em in here. Got it?"
"If it's not too much to ask, put the weapon away? Thanks."
"I trust I won't have to, but I'll bust your head in if you cause problems for my patrons."
"While a good fight is always entertaining, my patrons don't like blood in their food. Put the weapon away."
"If you don't mind, my patrons would appreciate it if you put the weapon away."
"Don't break anything with that weapon, okay?"
"You break it, you buy it."
Please... don't break my wares!
"If that weapon breaks anything, you will be buying it."
This is a proper store. Start acting like a proper customer. Sheathe that weapon.
Don't start swinging that thing in here.
"If that weapon breaks anything of mine, I'll break something of yours."
"Put that thing away, or get out."
You should probably put that away before you knock something over.
"Break my stuff with that weapon, and I'll break you."
Watch it with that thing!
"Fine weapon, but you wouldn't mind putting it away, I'm sure."
Look. You're making my customers nervous. Put the weapon away.
You. Weapon. Put it away. Now.
"Don't start swinging that thing in here. You break it, you buy it."
Brandishing your weapon is not going to help you negotiate a better sale...
You're disturbing my other customers.
"That weapon breaks my wares, we're gonna have us a real problem..."
You won't be intimidating me into lower prices. Put that thing away.
Walking around with your weapon out is bound to make people nervous. We understand each other?
"If that weapon causes problems for my customers, I cause problems for you. Got it?"
"Unless you're here to sell that weapon of yours, why don't you put it away."
Come on. Put the weapon away. You're making people nervous.
"Pff. Go away, if you know what's good for you."
I got nothing to say to you.
I'm not looking for a conversation.
Leave me alone.
He's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
She's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
You're sure?
Of course I'm sure! He was asking about Esbern.
Of course I'm sure! She was asking about Esbern.
Doesn't matter. We'll kill them either way.
"For your help, I'm sending word to the Orc strongholds that you're to be trusted. You should be welcome there now."
Yes. I earned the right by slaying my father in single combat.
"One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief."
"Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength."
Are you a sellsword? I don't like your kind. No honor. No loyalty. Unreliable.
But I can't turn away a potential ally in these times. Let's see if you're better than a common mercenary.
"My scouts have tracked down one of the Forsworn leaders, hiding out in their blood-soaked camps. Deal with them."
We will see.
Then leave.
"I'm impressed. Forsworn usually make short work of mercenaries, but you took care of them. Here is your reward."
"Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid."
"You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover."
"The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you."
"The contracts I dole out are fairly simple - go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different."
"The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed."
"You're headed to The Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison."
"And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself."
"You're only young once. Trust me, I know."
"Yes. Just because you're now a professional assassin, don't think you have to skulk around in the dark like a skeever and stab people."
"Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time."
"You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself."
"I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well."
"She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head."
"Of course, they'd probably already be dead..."
But you know what I mean!
"You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule."
"Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid."
"Does she? Listen, sister... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid."
"Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never."
Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.
"And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on."
"To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."
"Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women."
"Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others."
"You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother."
"The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious..."
"So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that."
"But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly."
"If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the Listener... your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to fear your power."
You've got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day. What's next? Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?
"Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?"
Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.
"It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring."
"But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude?"
"If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard."
"Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?"
"Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once."
"It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there's is a difference! Stupid cow."
"I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception."
"There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill."
I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.
"What's the matter, Listener? Night Mother not feeling very chatty these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers?"
"You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect... for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake."
"Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother."
"Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, sister."
"Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common."
"Killing him secretly will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses, so be it."
"Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him."
"I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable."
"Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!"
"Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did."
"Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words."
Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it.
"All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this."
"Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons..."
...go murder a clown.
"I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways."
"Our actions were shameful. Surely, the Night Mother weeps this day."
"The last thing you need is my help. Listener or not, you've proven yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family... and to me."
"Hmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably be an easy kill. Just be discreet - alerting others will be the real threat."
"Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven."
"That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy..."
Yes - don't kill the Gourmet!
"Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, less flavorful place."
"You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool... the sea."
"Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even earn his respect."
"You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and spectacular."
"Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up."
Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef - it only makes sense.
"Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications."
"Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an Atronach to cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away. Use your imagination!"
"What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis."
I am so very happy for you. If not a bit... envious.
"Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we celebrate."
"It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but I've secured your exit out of the keep."
"Just follow my instructions, and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you... Listener."
"Look. If you're trying to get to know me - don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But..."
"My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad."
Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.
I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf.
"So you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did."
"Oh yes, I was once brother to the Companions. Let's just say they found my methods [QUOTE]unsettling.[QUOTE] The Dark Brotherhood, obviously, feels differently."
"What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns."
"In fact, I once took a seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn... which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle."
"I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes."
"I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me!"
"Rather convincing, don't you think?"
"In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh."
"Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally - you can see how painful that would have been for mother."
"But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha!"
"When I was thirteen I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts. Completely."
I went on to teach at the College - left after two years. Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the Destruction school...
"Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my hatching."
"Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary."
"I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good."
"This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I first discovered my, shall we call it [QUOTE]aptitude,[QUOTE] for elimination."
"I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on."
"I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are."
"Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like most of my kind you'll find in Skyrim, that's for damned sure."
"I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe."
"My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back."
"Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like you. Hmph. No, definitely not like you."
"I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe."
"My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back."
"Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy..."
"But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray, that one will come to hear her say..."
The words.
"Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy..."
But I am not the Listener. Oh no. You are the Listener! You heard the words! And everything will soon be put right.
"Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an age long since passed. Astrid is my matron now."
"Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect."
"Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking."
The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.
"Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long."
"Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing."
"Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do."
"But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy."
"I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters."
"As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve."
"Welcome, people of Solitude! We of the Bards College are pleased to be here to celebrate the Burning of King Olaf."
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our latest applicant.
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our most recent inductee.
With the lighting of the effigy...
He becomes a full-fledged member of the Bards College. Please welcome our newest Bard!
We remember all those Solitude soldiers out fighting the good fight in this thankless war.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
You want to work on something that's not officially allowed? Don't tell anyone you're doing it.
"You need something you're not officially supposed to have, you come see me."
"You tell anyone that I told you, and I'll fry you from the inside out. Got it? Good."
"All right, let's not overdo it."
Meet me at my quarters.
I hope you've got some coin.
Let's just take a look then.
Well then you'd better have something I really want to buy.
"Before you even ask, yes I have an ancestry steeped in magic, and no I don't want to talk about it."
"Yes, I know Winterhold used to be full of my kind, and no I don't care that they're all gone now."
Does that cover everything?
"You're the one who's coming to Japhet's Folly with us, right? You ready to go?"
All aboard!
"Well, hurry it up!"

Well... if you say so.
Move along. Nothing to see here.
"Well, this is a nice mess you've gotten me into."
That could have turned out better.
I can't believe I got caught.
"Oh, you wanted the attic room? Why didn't you say so the first time?"
The thing is... we don't actually have an attic room. But I think I know what you mean. Go ahead and make yourself at home.
"Attic room, eh? Well... we don't have an attic room, but you can have the one on the left. Make yourself at home."
"Next to the door, the room on the left."
Teach them to stop paying me.
Here. You deserve a reward for your service.
"What? No! No, you don't understand! There's been some kind of mistake! I... Aggghhh!"
"Well then, if you don't want the extra gold, you can certainly let Letrush keep it as a gesture of goodwill."
"I'm not stealing anything. Besides, some jail time isn't going to make me roll over and play dead."
You there. I don't think I've seen you around before.
Haven't seen her around before.
Haven't seen him around before.
Come here. Let me see your face.
Seems a bit short to me.
"Wait, is that a tail?"
Must be new around here.
"Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?"
Who are you? Intruder!
What? Raise the alarm!
Raise the alarm! We've been infiltrated!
I'm still sore where I took that arrow. I hate archers.
This imperial armor is damn heavy.
I'm sick of waiting. When are we going to see some action?
Hope I don't draw guard duty.
I bet we have rabbit again. I'm getting sick of rabbit.
We're running out of bread. I hope the supplies get here soon.
"Aw, quit your bellyaching."
"Yeah, I know what you mean."
It's not that bad.
You'd rather be plowing a field? Not me.
Go tell the commander. I'm sure the boot in your arse will take your mind off your troubles.
You must be all right if you've got time to complain.
"We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice."
"You stand in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain."
"Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer selves."
"We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you."
We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.
We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny.
You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift.
But do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out for you? That remains to be seen.
You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind.
Whether you are the only Dragonborn of this age... that is not ours to know.
You are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can say.
"That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your destination."






It's time for you to go.
"Hey, get out of here!"
Leave or be removed.
You need to leave now.
"Go, you're not wanted here."
I don't think you belong here.
Leave now or suffer dire consequences.
Get out of here before I call the guards!
"Both of you... out, out!"
I think it's time for you to get going.
Could you please leave now?
You must leave immediately.
You're not welcome here. Go.
You need to leave.

May Kynareth's winds blow you to fortune.
For Kynareth!
Scourge of nature!
"I'm sure Pavo would be grateful, and we'd all rest a little easier."
"But that's nonsense. You can't handle a group of Forsworn by yourself. If their axes don't get you, their magic will."
I'd be grateful. Kolskeggr is my home.
"But, I wouldn't go there if I were you. There's a whole group of them with axes and magic on their side. You'd never stand a chance."
Aye.
You're telling me.
We're going to need an army to clear out that crypt.
"Fine, but there's a whole crypt of draugr underneath the mine."
"We're not going in there until the Jarl's men come to clear them out, so I wouldn't go down there."
"You're joking, right? Those bone-walkers will tear you limb from limb."
"But if you want to get yourself killed, go ahead."
Good to hear.
"They just call themselves the people of the Reach. Lot of common blood with the Bretons, by the looks of them."
"Used to have their own kingdom, till the Nords came, now they're at the bottom of the hay pile."
We will see.
Then leave.
Thank you.
As you wish.
What? That little tease! Leading me on and turning cold at the last minute. I don't think so.
"The Empire is fortunate to have the support of the Thalmor during this difficult time, don't you think?"
"Mark my words, the war will be over in a matter of months. Once Ulfric sees the full might of the Empire, I'm sure he'll come to his senses."
I don't understand why General Tullius hasn't been recalled. The man is clearly incompetent. I have half a mind to tell him so myself.
"Trust me, there's no place better to forge relationships with the movers and shakers of Skyrim."
I wasn't expecting to see you here! I assume you have your reasons. Everyone does.
"Look around the room and you'll see what we're up against. Just between you and me, a lot of what Ulfric says about the Empire is true."
I swear Elenwen holds these parties just to make the Empire look bad. Almost makes me want to join the Stormcloaks.
The only reason I'm here is because my refusal to attend would cause a diplomatic incident.
I need another drink.
I don't remember seeing you at one of these before.
Do I know you? I didn't think so.
Go ahead and play your joke.
"Just between us, I've got more important things to do than attend these meaningless parties."
I should be back in Windhelm. I've got work to do.
Did you know Vittoria is the Emperor's cousin? Best stay on her good side.
Did you know Vittoria's getting married? They say the Emperor might even come to Skyrim for the wedding!
I'm ready for this party to be over.
Vittoria! There's someone I'd like you to meet.
"It's very nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse Orthus here. He so rarely gets back to civilization. Stuck in Windhelm, poor fellow."
"Don't worry, Orthus. I'm doing my best to get you reassigned to Solitude."
"Oh, don't worry about me. I relish the challenge."
You think living with Grogmar is easy? Did you see how he lives?
You two will just have to learn to get along until we can build you another house.
At this rate that'll never happen.
Quit your bellyaching. We've all got our problems.
"I've been cracking rock ever since I was able to hold a pickaxe and I'm telling you, this mine is drying up."
"And I'm telling you, you're wrong."
What makes you so sure? What if I'm right?
"I know there's ore still in there, I can smell it. If you think you're right then you can pack up and leave any time you like."
"How are your parents faring, Grelka? Doing better than we are I would guess."
"It's no feast in their neck of the woods either. Last time I was up there, father said they were barely scraping by."
This civil war is taking its toll on all of us. Miners are some of the hardest hit.
That's what scares me. I'm afraid I'll travel to Darkwater Crossing and find it burned to the ground.
All I'm asking is that you clean up once in a while. How you can find anything in your half of the place is beyond me.
I'd rather spend more time in the mine hauling up iron then doing woman's work keeping the house clean.
I'll have you know I can haul up just as much iron as you in a day and still manage to clean up my messes.
"You think so, huh? Maybe you'd like to put some septims behind that boast."
You have yourself a bet.
"Grelka, do you fancy a walk tomorrow?"
"Odfel, I've told you time and time again. I'm not interested in a relationship with you."
"And why not? I'm handsome, strong and smart. What else could you possibly need?"
I need someone that cares about me more than they care about themselves. That person isn't you.
"I've been watching the way you mine and I have to say, I'm very impressed."
I owe it all to my father who started me swinging the pickaxe when I was a barefoot little girl.
"Well, it shows. Your skill rivals some of the greatest miners I've known."
Thank you. It's nice to know someone admires me for more than just my appearance.
This is not the time to keep Astrid waiting.
"It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all."
"Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood, and Astrid was just a [QUOTE]pretender.[QUOTE]"
"I assume you saw the Gildergreen? Big tree, all burnt up, in the middle of the Wind District."
"It's part of the Temple of Kynareth. People want Danica to do something about it, but I don't know what they expect."
Here you go. Your continued assistance to the cause is appreciated.
I wish more had the dedication and strength of character that you demonstrate. I'll be sure this gets put to good use.
"I surrender! Give me a few hours to gather my household, and I'll depart. You have my word."
Now? I announce to all of Markarth that I have returned. Don't worry about your name. They'll know who to blame and fear after today.
"It'll take years, but I'll organize the Forsworn again. We'll reclaim our land, and then, when power is ours, we'll have peace. A kingdom."
"Until then, let me offer you a warning. Beware the Forsworn. No place in the Reach is safe from us now."
"You mean the official sort of business? Hmm, well... no. No, not really."
"But... I can't help but notice that you're doing quite well for yourself, rising through the ranks and all."
"It may not be [QUOTE]official[QUOTE], but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on."
I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.
What?
"No, no. Goodness, no!"
"At least, I don't think so. No, it's just... It's just something I'd prefer to keep to myself."
"Ah, yes. Umm, no. No, I don't think so. Not at this point."
"It's just that, well I'm not even really sure it's going to amount to anything just yet. All theoretical right now, you understand."
"But the implications are quite intriguing, I think. I simply need some experimental results to confirm my suspicions."
Just... Just bring me some Dwemer cogs. I need to examine them for the methods used in forging them.
"Ten of them should be enough for me to get a better understanding of how they were crafted. That's all I need, all right?"
"Ah, that's excellent news. This will be most helpful in furthering my research."
"I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now, but please take this. And perhaps, if this is all successful..."
"Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early to be getting excited. Still, this is most encouraging."
"Thank you again. If I require anything else, I shall be sure and let you know."
"I simply need more pieces of Dwemer equipment to study. It's nothing dangerous... At least, not necessarily."
"And please, let's just... Let's keep this between us."
"As a matter of fact, there is something you can do for me."
"What? Oh, no. No, no. I need more time to research the dwarven machinery. Thank you for offering, though."
"I had retained Enthir's services in, uhh, acquiring something specific."
"But now he's refusing to deliver. Could you perhaps speak with him, and see if we can come to some sort of arrangement?"
Oh dear.
He's so afraid to talk to me he's sending you to do it? I should've expected as much.
"I'm afraid you've been a little mis-informed. I have something of mine, that I was going to sell to Arniel."
"With all due respect, Arch-Mage, I'm not in a position to just give this away."
"I told Arniel what I wanted in exchange for it, and he was unwilling to come up with it."
"Now, if you're here on his behalf, I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on my original payment."
"You think you can do what he can't, and I'll sell it to you. Then you're free to run off to him with it, if you like."
"I have a... friend, let's say, who's interested in a staff. A particular one."
"It's nothing dangerous, so don't worry. I'm not even sure why he wants it, but then that's not really my concern. He's willing to pay for it."
"The problem is that it'll be a little difficult to acquire, seeing as how it's in the hands of someone who isn't exactly friendly."
"So, you bring that staff back here, and I'll consider it payment for the item Arniel was after."
"Well, well."
"All right, you delivered on your end, so I'll deliver on mine. Here's the gem Arniel was after."
Can't imagine what he expects to do with that... it's warped beyond any ability to capture a soul.
Do you?
"Wonderful. I was afraid I'd have to give up, and when I'm so close..."
Thank you for this. I have a great deal of work ahead of me.
"Terrible, just terrible. I vastly underestimated the heat transfer necessary, and have destroyed my only working model. I'm at a loss."
"Look, it's all very simple."
"The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of."
"Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... Mystery."
Don't patronize me!
"Their disappearance, of course!"
"Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened."
"After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation."
"Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster."
Precisely!
What could be worth studying about a long-lost civilization?
"Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event."
"The dwarves were very clever, tapping into and drawing power from the Heart of Lorkhan itself."
"Lacking the heart of a dead god myself, I was attempting to substitute a rather specific soul gem. The ahh, the one you helped me acquire."
"Well, yes. I mean, no. That is, it might, but I'm not completely sure. I'm no tonal architect, I've only read their writings. Scraps, really."
"The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The dwarves had machines for this sort of thing."
"I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwarven Convector."
"It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process."
"Hmm? No, no. No! I'm too close now. Can't take the time."
"Though... Perhaps there's another option. I, umm, I may require further assistance from you."
"Well, yes. The designs for my Convector were based on real dwarven machines, so there may still be some in existence."
"I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations."
Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
"It's very particular, and very important."
"Well, I... Don't you see?"
Unlocking this mystery... The story alone is worth more riches than you can even imagine.
"And perhaps... well, I don't wish to speculate, but... What if we could contact the dwarves? What if they're still out there? Imagine!"
"Wonderful, just wonderful! I knew I could count on you!"
"Now this spell is not for defending yourself, but it's just right for heating the Convector. At least three seconds' burn is necessary."
"Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors."
I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
"But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?"
"No, and at this rate, I never shall!"
Enthir is once again holding out on me. He refuses to deliver yet another item absolutely essential to my work!
"I am close, so close! You must force him to see reason!"
"I don't know, I don't know!"
"I've already agreed to pay him quite handsomely for the... well, the item in question."
Just... Do whatever it takes to get him to stop lording this over me.
"Oh, by the Divines, you too?"
I've already told him. I don't have it!
"Nothing, nothing at all! Arniel already overpaid for... whatever it is."
Did I ask you to? Did you hear me say that?
You're not listening to me. I don't have it.
I set up the whole deal. A courier was supposed to be bringing it from Morrowind. He never arrived.
"Okay? The deal was already done, the thing just never showed up. I can't help that!"
What?
I... I don't understand. Where is it?
"No, no no no. This can't be happening."
He has some simple-minded courier delivering it?
"It can't be lost. It just can't! It's irreplaceable, do you understand?"
"Without it, I cannot finish my work. All these years, so much time, so much energy..."
You must find it! It cannot end this way! Not after I've worked so hard!
"It... It's very valuable. Critical to my work, and one-of-a-kind. That's all I care to say for now."
Have you lost your mind?
"Think, please, just for a moment, about what he would do if he knew its true value."
"Do you really believe he would honor our agreement, or go running off to the highest bidder?"
"Please, you must set this right. I'm begging you."
I don't know. He never told me.
"He made most of the arrangements himself, he just needed it transported from Morrowind. That's what I agreed to help with."
"If I'd known it was so important to him, I'd have charged him more."
I don't know. Are you not listening at all?
"It was a simple task, so I didn't keep close tabs on it like I do with the dangerous stuff."
Last I heard he intended to pass through Eastmarch on his way here.
"Last I'd heard, he was crossing the border from Morrowind into The Rift."
"If you're getting involved in this, that'd be where you start looking."
"Why is this suddenly so important, anyway?"
"I heard one of them was just arrested trying to sneak into the city. If he's locked up in the jail, perhaps you can get it out of him."
"Please, I know I'm asking you to do something difficult, maybe even dangerous. I just don't know who else I can trust."
"You've seen them? Then waste no time, head there at once!"
"The longer they're around, the more danger I'm in! Please, kill Kematu and end this nightmare for me!"
Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.
Elenwen! This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.
I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!
"Is that so, Erikur? And you with such delicate sensibilities. It must have been most upsetting."
"Well. Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect. Take her downstairs."
No!
"Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing!"
"Sir, you must tell her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!"
"Yes, Madame Ambassador."
"Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over."
"I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir."
"I hope you're enjoying yourself, ma'am."
What can I get for you?
I trust that this is just the begining of a long and mutually beneficial relationship.
I'm so glad you could attend today.
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
"Please, help yourself to more wine."
The hospitality of the Thalmor Embassy is at your service.
"Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after."
"I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur."
Please tell him to leave me alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to him than I would.
There's a likely-looking filly. Even if she is an elf.
"You there! Serving girl! What's your name, dear?"
"Uh, Brelas, sir. Did you need a drink? Something to eat?"
"No, no, that's not what I'm interested in right now."
"I just wanted to get a better look at you. I like what I see, my dear."
"And believe me, I don't say that to everyone. I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form."
"Um, thank you. Sir. Was there anything else I can do for you?"
Oh... not at the moment. Maybe later. Don't go far.
"Yes, sir."
"Have you talked to Brelas yet? I'm not a patient man, you know."
Did you see that serving girl? I hear elf women are insatiable...
"For the man who knows how to make money, war can be a most profitable venture."
The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.
Elenwen always throws quite a party. I never miss one if I can help it.
"You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a stake in most anything of importance in Solitude."
"I feel that it's time to put aside the grievances of the past, and let peace and prosperity flourish between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion."
"I try to do my little part. Besides, just between you and me, it's making me pots of money, hahaha."
"Mmm, yes... Brelas, is that the one? I hope you're not thinking of cutting me out, are you? Haha."
"I'm warning you, when I get my heart set on something I'm not easily put off."
"Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be playing hard to get when I spoke to her earlier."
Go on. See what she says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.
"Ha. We'll see. I do have my eye on her, but she seemed a bit cold when I spoke to her earlier. Maybe just playing hard to get, eh?"
"Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now."
"Haha. I knew it! No woman yet born has been able to resist my charms for long. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one."
"Hello, my dear. I got your message. Where shall we go?"
"So. You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want."
"What? I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood. I'm not permitted to leave the party."
"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier. I meant no disrespect."
"Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer."
"Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?"
"No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I must get back to my duties."
"Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut! Do you know who I am?"
"Please, sir, leave me alone!"
Use your Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.
"Trust me, we have nothing to say to one another."
Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it was worth it.
I should have known this would end badly. I can't believe I let Delphine talk me into this.
"Let's get out of here, for pity's sake!"
I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.
We've got to get out of here.
You saved my life. I won't forget it. Look me up if you're ever in Riften.
"You didn't have to help me, so... thanks."
"Here's your pay. It's never enough for what we do, but war gives us warriors its own kind of benefits, doesn't it?"
"Are you sure? It's rightfully yours, but this money could go to getting better weapons and armor, and making repairs to the settlements we control."
"Did you clean the linens, yet?"
I did. Those mead stains are always tricky.
"Mama, where did papa go?"
"He's off fighting the war, dear. For the Stormcloaks."
Last time you said he was fighting for the Empire.
Yes. I'm sure he's doing well there.
"Nosy one, huh? I was a mage back in Morrowind. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe."
"By Azura, it gets hot in there. I use Frost Salts for a potion to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out."
"If you want to go to the trouble, feel free. I suppose I could offer you a bit of free Alteration training when you get back."
"It's not any of your bother, so I don't see what you're apologizing for."
"Well, well, you actually did what you said you were going to do. I'm impressed."
"Here, let me teach you a thing or two about Alteration magic. It's the least I can do."
Suppose so. Got one all saddled if you've got the coin.
Not today. Sold my last one. Pretty sure I sold it to you.
"Yeah, I got one for sale."
You could if I had one. Sold my last available horse to someone that looked an awful lot like you.
Got one all saddled and ready to go. What are you willing to pay?
If I had one. Sold my last one to you a bit ago.
Reckon you can. How much you willing to pay?
Nope. Sold my last one to some stranger.
"It's for sale, if you've got the coin."
Not right now. You bought my last one.
That one with the saddle? How much are you offering?
Can't help you. They're all spoken for.
Don't mind if you do. What's your price?
If I had one you could. They're all spoken for.
I've got one all saddled up for you! What do you figure she's worth?
"Wish I did, but some outlander bought my last one."
That's what I'm here for. What are you offering?
Don't have any that are for sale right now.
"Yes! Yes, you can. She's all saddled up and everything."
"Not today. You should have come by earlier. Wait, didn't I sell me last one to you?"
You've got a deal. It's the one with the saddle.
Then come back when you've got that much.
That'll do. She's all saddled up for you.
"When you get it, she's yours."
"Sounds fair. She's yours. Like I said, she's all saddled."
"When you got that much, we'll talk."
Fair enough. You can have her. She's the one with the saddle.
Didn't think you had the coin.
That's your best offer? I suppose so. She's the one with the saddle.
"If you had it, you'd be riding and we wouldn't be talking."
"That much? I mean, of course. If that's all you've got."
"I'd sell her for that, but you ain't got it."
Sold. She's all yours. She's already saddled up.
"That would work, except you ain't got."
Wish everyone haggled like you. She's all yours.
Too bad you don't have that much. Guess you'll have to walk.
Good enough for me. It's the one with the saddle.
"That would be a fair price. When you've got it, come see me."
"Wow! Didn't think I could get that for her. I mean, sure!"
Looks like you're a little short on coin though. Sorry.
Suit yourself.
Don't blame me if your feet get sore.
Then stop wastin' my time.
Off with ya then. I've got work to do.
Didn't think you had the coin for it anyway.
Then off with ya. I've got better things to do.
Should have known you'd be a cheap one.
Then what are you wasting my time for?
"Walkin' never hurt nobody. If you change your mind, I'll be here."
"Oh. Was it something I said? I can't afford to lower the price, but come back if you change your mind."
"So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?"
"Ah, you're back. Ready to try again, are we? Let's start from the top. You were sent to kill the Gourmet. And he is..."
"Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane. Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as his own."
All you've got to do is find and kill one lousy chef. The clock is ticking...
"So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well."
"You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid..."
"Ah, and word has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely demise."
You performed your duties to the letter.
"Right, which we had already established. And you managed to hide the body as well? Good."
"You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. So there's that. And Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good."
"Well, looks like you completed the contract as directed. Finally. A little sloppy, but, well... done is done."
"Here's your gold, with a little extra for hiding the body. Now go see Astrid. The final stage of the contract has come. The Emperor must fall."
Good. And his Writ of Passage?
"Oh wait, let me guess - you don't have them."
Fool! Amateur! Without those papers you'll never be able to present yourself as the Gourmet! Off with you! Back to the body to retrieve them!
"Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage too, I see, so that's done."
"But why? Why, pray tell, have I received word that Anton Virane is still walking around Markarth, hale and healthy as the day he was born?"
"Back to Markarth with you! Virane must be silenced! He's a potential witness, you witless dagger jabber!"
"Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So there's that."
"I've also received word from Markarth. It would seem Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good."
"But unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to handle?"
Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.
"Look. I gave you a contract, and you completed it. Barely. Now let's go back to you being insufferable, and me being... me."
(screams)
There's a... ghost. Just wandering around my inn like it owned the place.
"Yes. I've heard stories that Old Hroldan was haunted, but no ones seen a ghost here since the Great War."
"He's from the battle, I just know it. He's one of Tiber Septim's soldiers... back from the dead."
Hjalti? I've never heard of anyone named Hjalti. Tiber Septim had many names. Maybe that's one of them?
A sword? I remember a legend that Tiber Septim had attacked one of the enemy camps before he came to Old Hroldan. It could be there.
I'll mark it down on your map.
"It's been an honor to serve you, brother."
Remembers our lessons from the sword masters of Alcaire? Let me show you a few things you may have forgotten before we leave Hroldan.
Mara have mercy that gave me a fright.
Do you think the ghost is one of... Tiber Septim's dead men?
"All of a sudden, the ghost disappeared. What happened to it?"
Do you think that ghost is coming back? It seems to have vanished.
"I was just getting used to that ghost being here, and poof, now he's gone."
Hjalti? Is that you? I've been waiting.
I've been waiting for you. Hjalti.
I fought by your side. To take back the Reach from the savages.
"Do you remember me now, Hjalti?"
"Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman!"
Please. Please just let me be...
The... the Gourmet?
"Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to my grave."
The Dark Brotherhood?
"Now... now wait a minute. Let's not get hasty. I mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right?"
"Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc! He's staying at the Nightgate Inn. That's all I know!"
Now... now you'll let me go. Right?
"Okay. All right. Wonderful. You're welcome! I'll just be on my way, then..."
"No. Oh, please no..."
So... we're done?
"Listen up, spy! You're trapped in here, and we have your accomplice."
Surrender immediately or you both die.
"Never mind, I'm dead already-"
"Silence, traitor! Move. Slowly."
He's got to be here somewhere.
Good luck. You're on your own now.
I wish you luck in finding the verse.
We should really get to court.
We should present the verse soon.
Don't forget to speak to Jorn when you're ready for the festival.
"Be careful, you might find more than just King Olaf's Verse in Dead Man's Respite."
Best batch of Spiced Wine I ever had.
I thought the festival wasn't happening this year.
Thanks for convincing Elisif to put this on again.
Come on! Light the fire!
"Jorn is the best of the bunch, you should hear him sing."
I heard you're the reason we get to have this.  Thank you.
I believe Sanguine would be pleased with this festival.
I like the pretty lights.
Burn the king!
You've done well by restoring our Festival.
Thank you so much. The festival has really increased my sales.
There's the man himself!
There's the woman herself!
Burn the King!
Congratulations on getting the festival restored.
Get your festival meat pie. Specially made.
Try our meats made here at the Festival. They're the best.
So nice to get this break from my cleaning duties.
You might as well have some sweets. I made them for the festival after all.
Great. Looks like you'll be one of us soon.  We'll gather outside the College for the Burning of King Olaf.
I'll tell everyone we're ready but we'll start the festival at dusk.
"Come talk to me after dark, we'll get the festival started when you do."
I'll speak with Aela about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
I'll speak with Farkas about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
"It's tough, with just the two of us."
There's hardly ever time to make the occasional delivery to the taverns of Skyrim.
We could use a pair of hands and a strong back. There'd be a little coin in it for you.
Indeed I do.
"That'd be great. There's a case of our soon-to-be famous mead that needs to get to Winterhold. Get it there, and you can keep the delivery fee."
"Ah, good. I've been waiting on that."
Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
"Ah, good. I've been waiting on that."
Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
"Ah, good. I've been waiting on that."
Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
I need you to take a case of mead to the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
Another case of mead needs to find its way to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
"Candlehearth Hall is running low on our famous mead. Can you drop off this case? The gold is yours, as always."
"There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?"
Quite so.
"But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a [QUOTE]he.[QUOTE] Could be a woman for all we know."
Don't be so petulant!
"In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!"
Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
"Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!"
"In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!"
Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
"You know, maybe I was wrong about you after all. Anyone who's smart enough to shut up and listen can't be all bad."
"In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!"
Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
"I believe so. Therefore, you are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found."
"Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him."
Loose ends and all that.
"Next, you'll have to... Are you still paying attention?"
Hmph.
"As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place."
"Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better."
Now off with you!
Who are you? What do you want?
Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were.
"Here's your payment. And... a little something else, as well. From me. Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly!"
It's called the Nightweaver's Band. I wore this for years. I want you to have it now. It'll give your magic and sneakiness some much needed [QUOTE]oomph.[QUOTE]
"Now, you'd better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation."
"You promised me, Hjalti. You promised that when we sacked Hroldan, you would make me your sworn brother."
And I've waited. Even after the enemies' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited.
"Give me your sword, Hjalti. That we may become brothers as you promised."
"The most well known stronghold is Dushnikh Yal. Here, I'll mark it down for you."
The strongholds keep to themselves. Skyrim hasn't always been kind to the Orcs.
"For an outsider like you to be accepted, an Orc would have to make you Blood-Kin, and send word to the chiefs."
Trust like that is not freely given.
"Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Brother to the Orcs."
"Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Sister to the Orcs."
"No, no! This is the wrong way!"
"We need to go upstairs, that's where she is! That's where the books are!"
"Wait, what?"
I thought I was going to help you!
"Well yes, I did. And thank you so much for helping me."
"But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College."
I'm not sure where else I'd go.
"Are you quite sure? I don't want to get in the way, but..."
"But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College."
"I'm doing as you asked. Not for nothing, I hope?"
I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone who's anyone in Skyrim.
"That's General Tullius himself. He can't stand Elenwen, but she insists that he attend these parties. Just to piss him off, no doubt."
"See that disgusting drunk over there? A high-ranking official in the East Empire Company, believe it or not."
To maintain relationships.
"By the way, I don't know who you are, but unless you want me to blow your cover, I'd advise that you avoid me for the rest of the party."
You have asked for my help. I am providing it.
The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.
It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.
None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.
"At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be."
"It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are."
There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their obligations to help root out the Talos heresy.
"Fortunately, those most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have now branded themselves traitors as well as heretics."
I am here to remind the ruling classes of Skyrim that their loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation with the Thalmor.
"Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the Thalmor, as you well know."
"Yes, that's probably for the best. I really shouldn't risk getting on Elenwen's bad side."
"Yes, this probably isn't really the place for your little jokes."
Thank you. I knew you'd understand.
I'll try to forget you ever asked.
Hmm. Very well. I'm putting my reputation on the line for you.
This is neither the time nor place for such things. I'm surprised you would ask it of me.
Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?
Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.





Let's begin again.
No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...
You know the rules.
Noooooo!!!
"Start at the beginning, as usual."
If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...
"No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything..."
There's an old man. He lives in Riften.
"He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know."
And his name is...?
I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred-
Ahhhh!
You know the rules. Just answer the questions.
And where can we find this nameless old man?
"Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure."
That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.
"What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where-"
Gaaaaah!!!
"Silence, prisoner!"
"No idea, but whatever he did it must have angered Maven. No guard would lock up a Black-Briar without the old lady's permission."
"Ah, and let me guess. He wants his horse. Well, that's going to be a bit of a problem. You see, I don't really outright [QUOTE]own[QUOTE] Frost..."
"That is correct. You see, Frost belongs to the Black-Briar estate. Technically everything in the estate is owned by my mother, Maven."
"My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned..."
"Still, I don't want to cross Letrush. Tell you what. Steal the horse and deliver it, and you can have the second half of the payment."
Then I think we're done talking.
Welcome to the Bards College. I am the headmaster here. How may I help you?
I have faith that you'll return with King Olaf's Verse.
"Ah, you have returned. How goes the task I gave you?"
I still don't know if rewriting the verse is going to work.
I do hope the court likes the verse. I think we've done an excellent job of recreating it.
We should have the festival soon.
Good to meet a prospective Bard.
Get the coat. Then we'll talk.
Nice to meet the person who went to King Olaf's Tomb.
The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery.
"We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed."
"I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to."
"Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word."
"Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them."
Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it.
"Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them."
It's frightening living below their monastery.
"Sometimes I swear I can hear strange noises rolling down from up there. It sounds like thunder, but there's never any rain."
What do you make of that?
"The Greybeards stay away from me, and I stay away from them. Suits me just fine."
Always thought it was odd that there's a layer of thick clouds covering the peak of the mountain above the monastery.
"Not sure what's up there, but I bet the Greybeards know."
"They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine?"
I'm not certain if I could even make it to the top without collapsing from exhaustion.
The Greybeards are a strange bunch.
I heard they live their entire life without uttering a single word; can you even imagine?
"I've always fancied a journey up the 7,000 Steps to the monastery."
Anything to break the boredom of living in this town. I envy you.
I think you should continue with your performances.
"What's the point? I'm not very good, and it's only for the same few people every night."
I think you play beautifully. It would be a shame if you stopped.
"All right, Wilhlem. I suppose it's the least I can do for you."
I think I saw it again. That... ghost. It was over by the barrows.
"That thing's evil, Lynly! I told you to keep away from there!"
I'm sorry. I was curious... I didn't believe the stories. I won't go over there ever again.
See that you don't. I promised to keep you safe and I'm not going to break my word.
Have you spoken to Fastred yet?
"No. I'll tell you, Wilhelm, if I could sweep her away from here tomorrow I'd do it, but Klimmek still has so much to learn."
Klimmek is doing just fine. You should follow your heart.
"Perhaps one day, but not today."
"You heading up to High Hrothgar soon, Klimmek?"
I wish I didn't have to. It's quite a difficult climb.
Take your time then. It isn't as though the Greybeards are going to complain.
"I know, but I don't want to let them down. I guess I better start thinking about it soon."
I thought you played wonderfully last night.
Thank you Klimmek. That's too kind.
"Perhaps when you're finished here this evening, we could..."
You're sweet. I'm just not ready for that sort of thing right now. I'm sorry.
I heard Temba yelling at you yesterday. Why do you let her treat you like that?
"If you'll pardon the expression, she's far more bark than bite."
"Perhaps, but abuse is abuse. I don't think I could stand it."
"There's much more to worry about in life then a bit of a temper, my friend."
"Fastred, I wanted to talk with you."
What is it now?
"Wilhelm said he saw you speaking to one of the pilgrims on the 7,000 Steps. I told you that I didn't want you to go up there."
"I know what you said, but I only wanted to speak to him for a moment."
You have to let Fastred follow her heart. You can't tell her what to do.
"She's our only child, Boti. Am I to throw her to the wolves?"
You're hardly throwing her to the wolves. She just wants to see the world... just like I did when I was her age.
"And if she decides to leave Ivarstead, what then? No, no... I can't bear the thought."
"I need you to pitch in a little more around here, dear."
"I help, I do the chores. What else would you have me do?"
"I know your sights are set beyond this town, but for now, while you're under our roof, I need you to pitch in a little more."
"Yes, mother."
We're behind again. I need you to catch another two bushels by week's end if I'm to make another delivery.
"Blood from a stone, Klimmek. I've been out there every morning. They just aren't biting."
"Come on, everyone in town knows that you spend more time with Fastred than fishing in the river."
That's none of your business and I appreciate if you wouldn't mention it again.
"If you have a moment, I've come up with a few ideas I wanted to share."
I'm becoming sick to death of your ideas. Not one of them has paid off since you moved in.
"Look, I'm merely suggesting a few things that could expand our business."
[QUOTE]Our[QUOTE] business?
"As I remember things, it was you that showed up at my doorstep looking for a job and a place to live. Try and remember that."
"Another batch of logs completely ruined. I swear, these bears have it out for me."
"I hardly think the bears are clever enough to hold a grudge against you, Miss Temba."
"When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. Otherwise, mind your business."
Gwilin! I told you to cut those boards at twice arm length! My arm's length. Not yours.
I'm so sorry Miss Temba. Perhaps if you would have been more specific...
Sigh. Everyone isn't as short as you are... what good are these boards to someone of the proper height!?
"Sorry, Miss Temba."
Still eager to please. This is good. Skjor may be right about you.
He has something special planned for you. Better talk to him.
Yes. I have something a little different planned this time.
But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.
We will speak more.
"Yes, I have something special for you."
But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.
We will speak more.
Skjor was looking for you before. Talk to him before doing anything else.

"You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we have not spoken."
"You are new here, are you not? We have not spoken."
"I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold."
I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here.
But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College.
Are we clear?
Then allow me to introduce myself.
[QUOTE]Sir[QUOTE]? How quaint.
"Not often, no."
"Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying to avoid untimely deaths."
We also must make an effort to avoid worsening what Skyrim thinks of us.
"New here too, eh? It's good to see another Nord. I feared I'd be the only one."
"Almost doesn't feel like Skyrim, being so far away from the rest of the world here."
"New here too, eh? I'd hoped I wouldn't be the only Nord, but I should've known better."
"No offense, of course."
"Well, there's an Imbuer here in the Great Hall."
"Well, there's an Imbuer in the Great Hall."
"I'm sure you can figure it out on your own. If you can't, perhaps Urag has a book you can read."
My pleasure.
No. No I can't.
I have enough to keep me busy. View it as a chance to hone your craft.
"In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't normal dreams."
The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions.
The nightmares are an echo of her presence as she feeds.
Turn my back on these people when their lives could be at stake? I should say not.
"Those dreams are not just visions, they're a footprint left by the Daedric Lord Vaermina as she drains these people of their memories!"
"I understand. If you should change your mind, I'll be here."
Mara be praised!
"Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry."
"Ah, pardon me, friend. I didn't see you standing there."
"Allow me to introduce myself: Razelan. Imports and exports, by trade. Observer of human nature, by avocation."
Don't worry. I'll play my part.
I find these parties such a dreadful bore.
One thing everyone can agree on. This war is bad for business.
What does a fellow need to do to get a drink around here?
"Ah, I see. Very well, my friend. I'll do it."
"Oh... all right. If it's so important to you, I suppose I can help."
Very well. I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fun.
"You must be new around here. Bad manners to ask such a direct question, at one of Elenwen's little soirees."
"But I have nothing to hide. I'm in from the south, on business."
"And if you want to do business in Tamriel these days, well, you'd better get used to cozying up to the Thalmor. Like it or not."
Let's hear it.
Well... let's hear it.
My ears are always open to a friend's request.
"Say on, friend. What do you need?"
I'm always glad to help a friend if I can. What do you need?
"Oh? Something interesting, I hope?"
Of course! I mean... assuming you don't want me to kill someone for you. I might have to draw the line there.
I'm listening.
"What is it, my friend?"
"The East Empire Company has interests all across Tamriel, inside and outside the Empire's borders. We try not to get involved in politics."
"However, as the head of the company it's my job to make sure we maintain good relationships with prospective partners and investors."
Say no more. I was wondering what you were doing here... I'm glad to play my part.
"I trust you don't presume on our friendship? I am a Jarl, after all. I wouldn't want to appear foolish in front of these people."
Nothing would please me more. I'll keep their eyes away while you do what you came here for.
Hmm. I don't want to get involved in anything beneath my dignity as Jarl.
"Oh... perhaps not, then. I don't think the Jarl of Solitude should be participating in a childish prank."
"I don't know... I don't want to do anything that might offend Elenwen. There is a lot of money at stake, after all."
"I don't even want to know, do I? But for you... all right. I'll do it."
This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't compromise my position in any way?
That's it? Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually end up making a fool out of myself without even trying.
"No harm is meant to you, happy fool."
"Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your eyes! Get away, get away from me!"
"It's all for a good cause, old chap."
"Ulfric Stormcloak? The rightful High King? That's bordering on treason, man! Stand up. Stand up, I say!"
What...! Do you know who I am? I should have you taken up and flogged!
"Hey, Razelan, remember when you told me I'd never amount to anything?"
"Well, I don't think you should stay things like that about the Ambassador!"
Just play along.
How dare you! You disgusting pig!
"You've got a lot of nerve, suggesting something like that, to me of all people! If this was Riften, I'd have you thrown in the dungeon!"
How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!
You take it back then? You retract your statement? Well?
"Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more!"
"Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!"
There's no excuse for your behavior!
"You behave like you're carousing in a house of ill repute, not the residence of the Thalmor Ambassador!"
"I know you're drunk as usual, but that's no excuse for insulting our hostess."
I don't think anyone deserves that kind of abuse! I've known plenty of elves who were perfectly decent people.
"The head office will hear of this, Razelan! You're a disgrace to the East Empire Company, and to the Empire itself!"
You're a disgrace to the Empire. To think that you're actually the representative of the East Empire Company.
"When people talk about the decadent, tottering Empire, it's people like you they have in mind!"
Your insults and provocations have gone far enough!
I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion.
Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time.
Razelan. What is it this time?
Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.
"Yes, Madame Ambassador."
Tell your men to stand down. I don't need any help dealing with this kind of fool. He isn't worth the trouble.
I apologize for the disruption to such a festive occasion.
"Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's no harm in him. Please, let him go."
"Oh... I'm afraid I may have overreacted. Please, I've already forgotten whatever it was he said to me."
I'm sure he's learned his lesson. Let's try to enjoy ourselves.
"I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's no need to have him thrown out on my account."
"Oh, Ambassador Elenwen, that won't be necessary. It is just Razelan, after all."
"I'm sure he'll behave himself for the rest of the evening, won't you dear?"
"Well, now. There's no need to ruin the party on my account. I don't think he'll be bothering me again."
"Forgive me, Ambassador. I allowed this... fool to provoke me. The fault is mine. There is no need for further disruption on my account."
"I don't understand... did you say Ulfric Stormcloak? Fine fellow, although a bit too fond of... I mean, no, of course, I condemn him in the most..."
"Hmm? Did you say snakes? Where? I hate them, always slithering they way they do... what? Are they on me?"
"What? Of course I know who you are... I didn't mean to suggest, that is, I don't remember even saying that..."
"What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I don't mean to say I wouldn't be interested... what I mean is..."
"What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I would never openly insult your... that is to say..."
I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!
This is preposterous. Disrespect... insulting! I am tired of being hounded from all sides!
"Madame Ambassador, you know that I would never have behaved... that is to say... well I swear I'm innocent this time!"
"Absolutely not! I protest... uh, that is, yes, of course. I still don't understand what just... oh never mind."
"That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What... I don't understand why everyone... never mind."
Who can say? Perhaps she collects them for display like works of art in a nonsensical art gallery.
"Whatever the case may be, her intentions are far from benevolent."
Well I'm glad you were there. I don't know how I would have gotten past the Forsworn without you.
Thank the Divines we survived that.
Those Forsworn were fierce fighters. Fiercer than I could have imagined.
"Do you think the Forsworn will come here? I mean, if they attacked Kolskeggr...."
Let's just hope that doesn't happen.
"That I do. If you want to grab a pickaxe and dig up some iron, feel free. I'll pay for anything you bring me."
"Skaggi is in charge, not me."
That it is. Good to be home. Let me know if you dig up any ore. We'll pay a fair wage.
Seems Kolskeggr Mine got hit by Forsworn. Those madmen get more bold every season.
"Pavo and Gat are the only survivors. I'll be sending word to the Jarl about this, but I don't know when help will come."
Was. Forsworn came in the night. Killed everyone. Gat and I are the only ones who escaped.
Hopefully Skaggi will send word to the Jarl and something will be done.
Ro means [QUOTE]Balance[QUOTE] in the dragon tongue. Combine it with Fus - [QUOTE]Force[QUOTE] - to focus your Thu'um more sharply.
"All Shouts are made up of three Words of Power. As you master each Word, your Shout will become progressively stronger."
But learning a Word of Power is only the first step... you must unlock its meaning through constant practice in order to use it in a Shout.
"Well, that is how the rest of us learn Shouts. As Dragonborn, you can absorb a slain dragon's life force and knowledge directly."
"As part of your initiation, Master Einarth will allow you to tap into his understanding of [QUOTE]Ro.[QUOTE]"
What kind of question is that? Look at me! Is this a young man's face?
"I've been here 50 years, and nothing is going to move me off my land."
What've you been staring at your feet this whole time? You see that big city up ahead of you? Markarth?
"Head over there, unless you feel like helping my wife pick crops. And then 50 years later you'll wake up and still be here."
Oh my. That...
You... you go first.
I'm ready. I made my peace with the gods long ago.
What are you waiting for? Do it!
"With me, you kill Skyrim's last hope. Mark my words. You'll all be serving elven masters soon. And know then, that I would have stopped them."
"By the gods, stop toying with me and do it!"
"Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you elsewhere."
"That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on you travels, kill them."
"With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all to the sword."
"The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world."
"If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the hills."
"True sons and daughters of Skyrim reign in every city, we've crippled the Imperial Legion, and cut off its head by killing General Tullius himself."
"What more could I ask of you? No, you're free to roam. I suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere."
"That said, some of the Legion's staunchest men have organized themselves, and are operating out of hidden military camps in the wilderness."
"If you come across any Imperials in your travels, I expect you'll know what to do."
"No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true son of Skyrim. You'll know what to do."
"To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there."
"No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true daughter of Skyrim and'll know what to do."
"To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there out there."
"No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years."
"Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords... but, I've come to respect them."
The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.
The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments.
"I may understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best."
"This is the land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part in making it strong again."
"No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be better for all that way."
"But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting like it. There's much to do. The new Jarls need help building armies, and enforcing their right to rule."
"The Empire may try to reclaim Skyrim, and I need everyone ready for that. Though the biggest threat, of course, is the elves."
"Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You know, make sure they're generally following orders."
"Can't say I'm looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for their new armies."
"The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the elves soon enough."
"We'll need trained, disciplined and creative warriors ready for all that."
"The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but by in large, the people here desire peace."
"What I'm not so sure about is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll keep that between the two of us, alright?"
"There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to fight us, and bring misery to the people... but they are few in number."
"The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to have their families return home."
And they should enjoy it while they can... I suspect all of Tamriel will again be called to arms in the not too distant future.
"There will be peace for a time, during which we must rebuild Skyrim into the land it once was. Strong. Self-reliant. The center of mankind."
Because getting rid of the Empire was only half the problem.
"Soon, the elves will again seek to rule the world. We must ready ourselves to fight them."
"For it will be Skyrim that shall lead Tamriel in those dark days, when the fate of the world is finally determined."
"Peace? When has any Nord ever known peace? Skyrim breeds warriors. It's who we are, it's in our blood."
"And that's as it should be. In the darkest days ahead, it'll be us Nords who lead the fight against the elves."
It's only a matter of time before their pointy ears start itching to rule the world again.
"It'll be Skyrim that leads the charge. Mark my words. And that time around, mankind will either succeed once and for all or die trying."
"Ignore me all you want, you still aren't getting in."
"Hey, you're not supposed to be down here. Official business only."
What are you doing down here?
"Oh, my mistake then. Sorry, you can go on ahead."
"Sure, and I'm Queen Barenziah. Now tell me another one."
"Sure, that'll do just fine. Go on ahead."
That's just insulting. Not even a proper bribe?
Bloody tourists.
"Forgive me milord, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed."
"Forgive me milady, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed."
"Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot."
"Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim."
Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger.
"Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight."
You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.
"All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either."
Here we go!
Well come back when you earn some more so I can take it from you!
"I don't blame you. If I were in your shoes, I'd chicken out too."
"Well, offer still stands if you ever want to have a go."
"Sure, I don't mind taking some more of your gold."
Just let me know when you're ready.
"I'll fight you again, but not until you have the gold to back up your bet."
Here we go!
Suit yourself. I'm always here.
Well done! Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften.
Allow me to present you with this compensation for your selfless efforts.
"I'll send my men to secure any of the remaining goods you left behind. We can't have that substance falling into the wrong hands now, can we?"
"Here, this should suffice as your cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
I told you everything I know. What else did you want?
You looking for something?
"I thank you for your help, my friend."
I think I've said enough. Now leave me alone.
"Be careful, Niluva is a bit... aggressive when she's cornered."
"Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you'd visit us again."
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; several of our citizens have expressed their admiration.
"So, I've been hearing your name in court quite a bit lately."
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; the people won't stop blathering about you.
"Much like Mjoll, you've become champion of our hold; helping people with their difficulties and providing assistance for their needs."
"As the Jarl of Riften, I feel it's my duty to honor your selfless behavior by honoring you with the title Thane of Riften."
"Oh don't pretend to be modest. I'm talking about your new role as champion. Apparently, you've taken my people under your wing."
"If you think you can steal my throne by winning the hearts of the people, that's where you're wrong. Keep that in mind."
"However, since it wouldn't behoove me to make you disappear, I'd rather have you on my side as Thane of Riften."
I should be the one thanking you. You've solved more problems in the short time you've been here then anyone in my court has their entire careers.
You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.
"Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations."
"I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine."
"Just remember that you're only a part of my court, this doesn't make you one of the family."
I guess all that's left is to bestow the title. What were those words again?
Doesn't matter... the title is yours. I henceforth name you Thane of Riften. Don't disappoint me.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be meeting Malborn in Solitude.
Not here. I told you to meet me in Riverwood.
"As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open the door."
"What can I get for you, sir?"
"What can I get for you, ma'am?"
Yes? What do you need?
You've already taken all the necessary steps in becoming eligible for the title.
Therefore all that remains is to bestow it upon you.
You damn well better.
I've checked with my court and apparently you're fully eligible... there's nothing standing in the way of presenting you the title.
"Before I can present you with the title, there's but a single requirement you must fulfill."
A Thane of Riften is expected to maintain permanent residence within the city walls.
My steward has such a home available to you for purchase. I think you'll find the accommodations to be most pleasing.
"When the house is yours, return to me and I will present you the title."
"Not so fast, there's a matter of residence to be discussed."
"In order to have the title bestowed upon you, you need to purchase a house within Riften."
"And by the Eight, aren't you fortunate that my steward has just the place for you to buy."
"After the place is yours, come back to me and we'll deal with the rest of the nonsense."
Then allow me to officially welcome you to Riften. You'll make a fine addition to our city.
All that remains now is to bestow the title upon you.
Hmm? What's this about?
"Oh, yes. Of course... the whole thane thing. I'd forgotten. If you're ready then, can we get this out of the way?"
Secure the door.
"Already done, sir."
Ulfric Stormcloak!
"You are guilty of insurrection, murder of Imperial citizens, the assassination of King Torygg, and high treason against the Empire."
It's over.
"Not while I'm still breathing, it's not."
Step aside Galmar. We're here to accept Ulfric's surrender.
I'll never surrender Skyrim into the hands of a corrupt and dying Empire.
"Skyrim doesn't belong to you, Ulfric."
No... But I belong to her.
Enough!
"You are traitors and will die traitors' deaths. Stand down and face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by my hands."
It matters little to me. Either way I'll be sending your heads back to Cyrodiil.
Well? What are we waiting for?
"Well Ulfric, you can't escape from me this time."
Any last requests before I send you to... to wherever you people go when you die.
Sovngarde... sir.
Right. Well?
Let the Dragonborn be the one to do it.
It'll make for a better song.
Talos be with you...
"What was that, Legate?"
Nothing.
Just saying goodbye.
"Well, the men will be expecting some kind of speech."
And we'll need to hand the city over to that Free-Winter fellow.
"Brunwulf. Yes, I've sent men to protect him and bring him here."
Windhelm will need a government quickly if we are to prevent more violence.
The Legion will be staying here for quite some time. I don't expect there to be any further violence.
Attention! General Tullius has an announcement!
The rebellion is over. Ulfric Stormcloak is dead.
His head will be sent to Cyrodiil where it will adorn a spike on the walls of the Imperial City.
Let this day be a final warning to all who would still call themselves Stormcloaks.
"We are turning the city over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man."
Many of you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here.
"In appreciation for your exemplary service, I am doubling your pay and compensation to the widows of your fallen comrades."
I am proud of all of you.
All hail the Emperor. All hail his Legionnaires!
I hate giving speeches.
It wasn't so bad.
I hope we haven't just created a martyr.
There's bound to be resistance. There are many Stormcloak camps tucked away in the hills.
They'll no doubt strike whenever and wherever they can.
"But without Ulfric to inflame their passions, they'll settle down and return to their homes eventually."
"I pray you're right, Legate."
"In the meantime, we'll continue to root them out and put them to the sword."
We couldn't have done this without you. The Empire glories in your accomplishments...
"Come, Rikke. There's still much to be done."
Arnleif and Sons Trading Company. I'm a porter. Just some muscle hired to move heavy packages.
But we don't get any shipments in. Forsworn attack every caravan. So all I do is sit here and drink.
"That's right. Welcome to Markarth, traveler. Thank the Divines you can choose to live somewhere else."
"How are you today, Thaena?"
"Same as ever. Trying to keep from freezing to death, trying to keep food on the table."
"Always looking on the bright side, aren't you."
"Don't sass me, little girl."
You got anything in here worth buying?
"I certainly hope so, otherwise I'm wasting my time."
"Yeah, well I don't see anything."
You looking for anything in particular this time?
"Perhaps, perhaps. I'm not quite sure what I need."
"Well, you know the drill. You don't see it here, it's gonna cost you extra for me to get it."
I'm fully aware of the terms of our... arrangement.
Have you gotten the items I requested from you?
"Not yet. You know you're asking for some pretty strange stuff, don't you? It's not easy to find."
"You assured me that you could find it, however."
"I did, and I will. It's just tougher than I thought."
"I can't thank you enough, friend. I'll hope you'll come back to Rorikstead soon and pay me a visit."
Maybe we can swap stories about our adventures over a mug of ale at the inn!
Can't blame you for having better things to do than help some farmer you don't know.
Seemed like the best way to see the world and make some coin.
"Sure I'm a little green, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in courage."
"Well, if you change your mind, I'd still like your help."
Did you reconsider? Will you talk to my father?
"Well, not exactly."
"Listen, we're friends, right?"
I wondered if I could ask a favor of you.
It's about Ranmir.
"Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind."
It's about Ranmir.
"Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with him being here all the time. He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay."
"I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean."
"Ah. Well, some other time, perhaps."
"Oh, he was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love."
"Well, I'm getting to that. Just let me explain."
"See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought."
"One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind."
"He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day."
"I'm not sure. I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together."
"I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could."
"I don't, I'm afraid. Ranmir didn't talk much about her after she'd left."
He seemed convinced that she'd run off with someone named Vex. That's all I remember.
Who's asking?
"Well, ain't gonna find her here. Haven't seen her in a while."
Not him again.
"He came nosing around Riften a while back, making a lot of noise about me. He was... persuaded to leave before he found me."
"Funny, I'd have thought she would've gone back to him by now."
"She came through a while ago, wanted to know where she could get her hands on something valuable. Anything, really."
"I told her it was a bad idea, that she wasn't cut out for what'd be necessary, but she wouldn't hear it."
"So I gave her some advice, pointed her towards Hobs Fall Cave and that was that."
"Like I told you, last time I saw her she was headed for Hobs Fall Cave. No idea what happened to her."
What?
Don't you... Don't you say that name to me.
Don't you dare. Ever.
Huh?
Ha. Sure you did. Dagur put you up to this?
It don't matter now. None of it does. Just leave me be.
"Unless it's gold for another round of drinks, I don't wanna hear it."
A what?
Don't you go pulling my leg. Give it here.
"This... This is really from her, isn't it?"
Did she really run off and do this? For me?
"By the Eight. She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault."
I... I have some thinking to do. Thank you for this.
"Please, leave me alone. I need to be by myself."
"Yes. The finest court in all of High Rock. You think politics here are something? Well, we Bretons invented politics."
"That is where I learned to cook, and where I belong. Not here, with all these dogs."
You. Who are you to approach the Jarl of Markarth?
"Very well, you may approach the Mournful Throne, but watch your words."
"Nothing to say. Fine, but I'm watching you."
"I don't know you, and I don't sell what precious property we have to outsiders."
"But if you're willing to work, and you prove to be reliable, I might deem you worthy to live here. My steward will handle things from there."
"My Jarl, we need to discuss the Forsworn."
The only thing we need to discuss is how many men it'll take to flush them out of the hills.
"It's not that simple, Igmund. There are reports of Forsworn here in the city."
"It doesn't matter if they're in the city. We fight them where they live, we won't have to fight them here."
"They live here too, my Jarl. That's what I'm telling you."
I don't blame you.
"As you were, then."
As you wish.
"All right, let's give this a try. Ready your ward..."
Good!
This is a shame.
Always sad when someone has to die.
Another one. Terrible.
Large diagonal cut from left shoulder...
"Hey, you. Get over here, I want to talk to you."
I don't know you. You in Riften lookin' for trouble?
"Yeah? Well, I got news for you; there's nothing to see here."
Last thing the Black-Briars need is some stranger stickin' their nose where it doesn't belong.
Don't say something you'll regret.
Last thing the Black-Briars need is some loudmouth tryin' to meddle in their affairs.
That's the wrong answer.
Last thing the Black-Briars need around here is some troublemaker tryin' to steal a piece of the action.
"The Black-Briars have Riften in their pocket and the Thieves Guild watchin' their back, so keep your nose out of their business."
"Me? I'm Maul. I watch the streets for 'em. If you need dirt on anythin', I'm your guy... but it'll cost you."
You can pretend not to hear me all you want... but you better stay out of the Black-Briars' business.
Then we're speakin' the same language. Good.
So what do you want to know?
Then you're stupider than you look.
You better watch your ass around here.
Pleasure doin' business with you.
So what do you want to know?
You don't have enough to earn my loyalty.
"All right, all right, let's not get too hasty now."
So what do you want to know?
Ha ha! Don't make me laugh.
Just stay out of the Black-Briars' affairs. You'll live longer.
Suit yourself.
I'll be at the docks if you change your mind.
"Yeah, walk away like a good doggie. Just stay out of the Black-Briars' business and maybe we'll give you a bone."
"Dirge told me you made it into the Guild. You need dirt on anything, you talk to me."
What did you want to know?
Back again? What is it this time?
You want to talk? Finish those jobs for Brynjolf first.
"Get in good with Brynjolf, then we'll talk."
Stay out of the Black-Briars' business and you'll live longer.
You aren't worth my time. Piss off.
I'm through with you. Get out of my way.
What did you want?
Slip up and I'll gut you like a fish.
Be seein' you around.
"Well, you got Maven, she pretty much runs the whole operation. She's got friends in high places if you know what I mean."
"She's also got ties to the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, so basically no one can touch her."
"Just remember, if she tells you to do somethin'... you damn well better do exactly what she says."
You kiddin'? My brother Dirge works in their hideout.
"I used to run with them myself, but took a job with Maven after they started hittin' a rough patch."
"If you want to get in on that action, find Brynjolf in the marketplace. I'm sure he could use someone like you."
Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar.
"Don't have to tell me twice. But then, I'm not the one that buried iron under these mountains."
You liar!
How could you do that to me!
You could have warned me you were baiting me into a trap.
But you're right. This should scatter the rest of them. I can go back to my life for now.
You have my thanks.
"A risky game to play, friend."
"But now Kematu's gone, and the rest of his snakes should slither back to their desert."
I can go back to my life for now.
And I have you to thank for it. I won't forget this.
"Svana, I heard that Sibbi was put in jail. What happened?"
"They say... well, they say he murdered someone. Something to do with Svidi."
"Come to think of it, I haven't seen Svidi in a while. Wait... he didn't..."
"No, it was Svidi's brother, Wulfur. She's in hiding now. Somewhere far from here I'd suspect."
"If he wasn't a Black-Briar, I'd march right over to the jail and teach Sibbi some manners... but then I suppose I'd end up like Wulfur."
"Madesi, why don't you just take a bed here? There's no need to sleep in Beggar's Row."
"The cold stone, the dampness... it suits me, Svana."
"Are you sure that's the real reason? It wouldn't have anything to do with others making an Argonian unwelcome, because if it is..."
"You have a kind heart; much too kind for Riften. Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine."
"Hey, greenskin... close your mouth. Some of us are trying to eat over here."
"There's no need to be rude, Grelka. If you don't care for Argonians, then perhaps you should take residence somewhere else."
"Or perhaps you should crawl back into whatever swamp you came from, lizard man."
"You're not going to goad me into a fight so I'll get kicked out, Grelka. Eat your food and leave me in peace."
"I can't take it anymore, Tythis. Indaryn keeps pushing me around and I'm not even doing anything wrong."
Maybe it's time you quit then.
And do what? Losing a job from the Black-Briar family would make me a marked man. No one would ever take me on anywhere else.
Don't let it get you down. Indaryn will eventually tire of picking on you and move on to someone else.
"No, and before you ask, it's not for sale."
"I'm just protecting Bryling's investment. She's the owner, even though we're the ones here doing all the work."
"She's already come down hard on us for missing shipments. Likely to do it again, since we're late."
"Well, no."
But that's not the point.
"Bryling owns the mine, and she's not selling. We make her some decent coin running this place. Keeps her living well in Solitude."
"At least, when we can get shipments to her. We're late on the last one. I expect her to start breathin' fire any moment now."
You could take word to her that there'll be a shipment soon. Buy us some time and keep her off our backs.
"In exchange, I'm willing to let a few ingots go missing. Maybe more than a few."
Can't do that and keep an eye on things here at the same time.
"But... You could take word to her in Solitude, let her know it'll be coming soon."
I'd make it worth your while. No one would notice a few missing ingots out of the next shipment.
You're doing me quite a favor. I won't forget it.
I'm sure she'll be angry. Brace yourself.
Won't be 'some other time' at this rate.
Is everything all right? I've not heard from Sorli or Pactur in some time.
That's good news. I was starting to fear something had happened.
You have my thanks.
"He's the real head of this family. He may not be the eldest, but all the work that keeps us respected is handled by my Thonar."
We're the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion. Saviors of Mer. Victors of the Great War.
"The Empire exists because we allow it to exist, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that."
"As if this craggy, wretch of a city could give birth to a superiorly bred Mer such as myself. No, I'm not from Markarth."
I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of Skyrim. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city.
"It's a religious matter. The Thalmor do not recognize Talos as a god. He was only a man, and does not deserve to a place in our pantheon."
"The Empire has agreed to accept our beliefs, and its citizens have a responsibility to cease their heretical worship."
"You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having?"
"Ah, there we have it. This will be all I need to have Ogmund taken care of."
"I would like to personally thank you on behalf of myself and the Thalmor for your assistance. Here, for your work."
"Ogmund the skald. He's old, respected, and I know for a fact that he worships Talos in his home."
But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for his arrest. I want you to break in to his home and find evidence.
Hmph. Fine.
The Thalmor saved all of Elven-kind during the Oblivion Crisis. We've been watching over our lands for 200 years.
"We re-founded the Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance between us and our Bosmer cousins. You might know them from their common name. Wood elves."
"We intend to prove the superiority of Mer over Man, one century at a time."
Damn Elves! You'll pay for this!
Praise Talos!
"No. I'm a Breton from High Rock, and I refuse to be mistaken for a filthy native."
"I don't care if we share the same ancestors, these people are savages. Half of them are Forsworn barbarians, and have you seen what they eat?"
What have I done for the gods to take me so far from my beloved Daggerfall?
"Good. I'd prefer using water to cool my metal, but it's what the Jarl wants."
Here. Some of my best armor. Wear it well.
"Anything. Served in the Legion with my sister, Ghorza, for over 10 years. We've seen every piece you can imagine."
Have you met her? She runs the forge near the smelter. Just don't bother talking to her apprentice. Boy has no talent.
"Depends on what you need. A light armor is good for travel. Less to carry. A heavy armor weighs you down, but no true warrior goes without it."
"If you want some heavy armor, I might have a deal we could work out. I need a Daedra's Heart. Jarl wants me to cool his new sword in blood."
"You get me a heart, I get you some armor. Interested?"
Good hunting.
Very well.
Beem! What are you doing?
Ugh... damn thing.
Just... stay back.
Back off.
Can't trust these things.
"No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of."
"Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation."
Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense.
Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful.
But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.
Have you found something?
"Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?"
The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for?
"Never mind, it doesn't matter. You need to leave. Now."
"Every moment counts, so I want you to take my horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool. Let's just say he's... one of us."
Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's all right.
"And then, send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void, in as many pieces as possible."
Please. You first. I insist.
"I just need to rest a moment, right here on this lovely rock."
"Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold."
Stand back and watch a true professional wreck a party.
My friend! A toast to a beautiful friendship!
(Clapping.)
"That man was, by far, the most insufferable decoy the Emperor has ever employed. I'm glad he's dead. Ah, but I'm even happier that you killed him."
"You, an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, have just made an attempt on the Emperor's life. Would have succeeded, had it been the real man."
"Surprised? So was I, when a member of your [QUOTE]Family[QUOTE] came to me with the plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange."
"I get you, and the Dark Brotherhood gets to continue its existence."
"But you know what? I've changed my mind. How about this? I kill you, and butcher each and every one of your miserable little friends?"
Your Sanctuary's being put to the sword right now. That's what I think of this [QUOTE]deal.[QUOTE] You killed my son! All of you! And now you'll pay the price.
Kill him. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
Kill her. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
But aren't even you the least bit nervous? After everything that's happened?
"Quite. Yet that recent business with the young officer. Maro, was it? How dreadful. The son of your commander, plotting your assassination."
"Yes, an unfortunate turn of events, that. But an isolated incident. And I have been assured that the fault was with the man's son alone."
"You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An unfortunate misunderstanding, no more. Cold mead, hot tempers... these things happen."
"Truth is, we are in no danger whatsoever. Killing an Emperor can be useful, but befriending one? Now that's beneficial - as I'm sure you'd all agree."
"Here we are. Gods, I'm nervous. We'll go in in just a moment. Please, I'll serve. You just stand there and... be amazing."
"Aha! Here we are. Honored guests, I present to you - the Gourmet!"
"Ah, the Potage le Magnifique. So delicious. My friends, as Emperor, I of course reserve the right of first taste."
(Laughing.)
(Laughing.)
(Laughing.)
By the gods! The Gourmet has killed the Emperor! Attack!
By the gods! The Gourmet and the chef have poisoned the Emperor! Get them!
Looking for work?
"Good day, Grelka."
"What's so good about it? I've got deadbeats who don't pay me, the city guard looking over my shoulder and Maven Black-Briar breathing down my neck."
"You poor thing. You should come by the temple, speak to Maramal."
"Religion isn't going to save me. So unless Mara is going to start raining coin from the heavens, why don't you mind your own business."
"Grelka, have you had anyone come by and try to sell you an iron war axe?"
Not lately. Why?
"Well, we had one go missing from the Pawned Prawn, and I was just wondering..."
Oh I get it. [QUOTE]It's missing so Grelka must have it.[QUOTE] I wish this town would stop pointing their fingers at me.
There is a Thieves Guild in town you know.
"Oh, Haelga... there you are. Your special order from Hammerfell came in off the last Khajiit caravan."
"Oh, good. I wanted to try that out as soon as possible."
Try it out? What would you need a leather harness for anyway?
It's a religious thing.
What's this nonsense I've been hearing? How dare you call Bolli a deadbeat!
"If he paid what he owes, I wouldn't have to say anything. Besides, what in Oblivion do you care?"
What's that supposed to mean?
"Oh come off it, Niv. We both know you married that fisherman for his gold. You don't need to put on an act for my benefit."
"Grelka, can you repair boots?"
"Leather? If they're armored, you should talk to Balimund over at The Scorched Hammer."
"Horker skin, actually."
"Why in goodness name would you have... oh never mind, just bring them by my house later and I'll see what I can do."
I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild seems to be back to its old tricks again.
Did something happen at the Pawned Prawn?
"One of them came in and demanded payment. Bolli tried to tell them no; stood up to them, but..."
Just when you think things couldn't get any worse.
"I don't like being made a fool of, Brand-Shei. Not one bit."
"Maven, please. I didn't know it was your man. Had I known, I would have looked the other way, I swear."
Turning him in to the guards? Have you joined Mjoll as official peacekeepers of Riften? You cost me a lot of coin.
"Maven, I... please, don't hurt me."
"Brand-Shei, do you think you can find me some theilul?"
The Argonian sugar-cane wine? It's pretty hard to get around here. Very expensive.
"That's fine. I have a special occasion coming up, and I'd like to have it."
I'll see what I can do.
"Brand-Shei, did you hear about Helgen? It's... it's gone! A dragon burned it to the ground!"
"Yes, I heard. I think all of Skyrim knows by know."
"Do you... do you think that could happen here? I mean, could a dragon come here and burn the city down?"
I don't know. All we can do is hope the Eight will favor us and have these creatures stay far away from Riften.
"Hi, Marise. How are you today?"
I'm well. How are things over at the stables? Old Hofgrir giving you a hard time?
"Naw... he's fine. Look, I wanted to ask if you'll... um, if you'd like to... well, like to have a drink with me at the Bee and Barb sometime?"
"Shadr, that's so sweet... I'd love to."
"I have two more bushels for you, Marise. That should keep you well-stocked."
Sounds good. May I owe you for them?
Of course.
"Say, how are you going to sell all those fish before they spoil?"
"You know I can't tell you that. As soon as I do, and you have a few meads in you, everyone will know."
Dinya? I was reading that missive you gave me and I was wondering something about marriage.
Feel free to ask me anything you like.
"There's someone I like very much in Riften. I think I'd like to marry him someday, but... well, he's not of my kind. Would Mara be angry?"
"Fine, fine. Get your hands off me. I'll be a good boy now."
"Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords, would we?"
"Someone bring me a drink, quick!"
"Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an announcement to make!"
I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress!
"I speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than that someone would actually want her in their bed."
"Although... most of you are already in bed with her! But again... I speak figuratively, of course!"
Razelan. What are you doing?

You have strong arms. You'd make a good Orc.
"Um... thank you, Lash. You'd... make a fine Nord?"
Don't say words you don't mean.
When are those Silver-Blood men going to leave?
"Never. They've shut us down forever, Enmon. The Divines have abandoned us."
"We're doomed. The mine is going to stay closed, and we'll up be carted of to Cidhna Mine as slaves."
Only criminals get sent to Cidhna Mine. They're not going to send us there.
"Oh, they'll find some way to send us there. It'll be just my luck."
But why did they take her? What could they want with our little girl?
"I don't know. The guards are out looking for her, now. They'll be back soon."
You keep saying that. What if she's gone forever? What if they've done something to her?
"Are you all right, dear?"
"The house is so... empty, Enmon... and quiet."
"Are you all right, dear? I thought I saw a tear in your eye a moment ago."
"Oh, I'm fine, Enmon. I just... I still miss her."
"I miss her, too, but I'm glad she's safe."
So am I. I hope she's happy at the temple.
"Enmon, dear, do you have any regrets? About letting her go?"
"No... no, we did the right thing. The temple will take good care of her, and one day she'll be helping all of Skyrim."
"You're right. She'll be a great Sybil, won't she?"
"Of course she will. She's our daughter, after all."
"I've been thinking, would you like to join me in hunting?"
You want me to hunt with you? I thought you preferred being alone.
"Your arms and legs are fit for catching strong, agile prey. I could use your help."
"I'd be honored, but I have work to do in the mines."
When will Sanuarach Mine be open?
I don't know. Whenever those Silver-Blood men decide to leave.
I haven't seen you hunting in a while.
"I can afford to buy meat now. I prefer working in the mines, anyway."
"Tell me, Ragnar, what do you think of the Orcs?"
"Cunning warriors and skilled workers. It's good to have you here, Lash."
"I asked what you thought of the Orcs, not about me."
"Oh. I'm sorry. Well, it's good to have you here, anyway."
Damn Nords. Always getting in the way of us honest folk.
"What did you say? You lazy coward, I'll cut your throat."
"Nothing, Ragnar. Please... don't hurt me."
"I... I'm sorry, Belchimac. I didn't mean that."
"You're always talking about the Forsworn. You aren't thinking of joining them, are you?"
Maybe I will. What do you think about that?
I'm warning you. Those people are killers. You'd never last a day with them.
I don't like bunking with Orcs. It's not... clean.
"If you want me to leave, you could challenge me to a fight. I promise to stop once you've lost an arm."
What I meant to say was... I love having an Orc here in the barracks. They're so... pleasant.
Why do your people claim the Reach is theirs? The Orcs have been in these lands just as long.
"You wouldn't understand, Lash. Your people aren't smart enough for politics."
Is that so? I'll remember that next time we're in the mine tunnels... alone.
"Did... did I say you weren't smart? I meant to say that I'm not smart, Lash. I'm just not smart enough to answer your questions."

"No, no... not at all. Mara believes that the spark of a union comes from inside us, not from our appearance."
"Tell you what... if you still feel unsure, come by the temple sometime and we'll talk about it."
"Marise, I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild has been harassing shopkeepers again."
I've heard. Bolli and Keerava were speaking of it just a little while ago.
I hope that doesn't mean things are going to get worse around here.
Mjoll! I'm glad I found you.
"What is it, Drifa? What's the matter?"
"It's Bersi. He's getting so angry about the corruption in Riften, he said he's going to walk right up to Maven and give her a piece of his mind."
"If I see him, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything brash. Don't worry."
"Have you prepared the stables like I suggested, Shadr?"
"Yes, Lady Mjoll. If Riften gets attacked, we'll retreat inside the city gates and bar the door just like you said."
"Good. You could be our first line of defense since you live outside the city walls, so we're depending on you."
Hello Bolli. How's the fishing?
Bountiful. Although I would like to have anchored a bit closer to Goldenglow Estate.
Why didn't you then?
"When I got close, the mercenaries Aringoth hired to protect the estate just waved me off. I don't think he wants visitors anymore."
"Nivenor, my darling. What a pleasant surprise."
"Oh! Bolli... yes, hello."
Will we be dining together this evening after my work at the fishery?
"Sigh. Yes, as usual. I'll be there."
"So, Tythis... you coming by the Bunkhouse later?"
Of course. I rented a bed there. Where else would I sleep?
I have plenty of room in my bed.
I want you sellswords out of my mine.
"Watch your tongue, native. We'll leave when we're sure there's no Forsworn here."
"Oh, and when would that be, I wonder? When I sell my land to the Silver-Bloods?"
The Silver-Bloods have made you a very generous offer for this pile of dirt. I suggest you take it.
Robbery is what it is. The Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land.
"Forsworn attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up to [QUOTE]help.[QUOTE] They won't let anyone work until I sell it off."
No. This is my land. You expect me to just hand it over to those Silver-Blood thugs?
"Forsworn attacked a while back. Jarl had no men to spare, so the Silver-Bloods generously offered to send us to clean things up."
"We just want that old native to hand over his land in payment for our services. Then we'll leave, and everyone can get back to work."
"Helping out Ainethach, huh? Give me a reason not to plunge a dagger in your chest."
A family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth.
"The Silver-Blood family own half the Reach, and they won't stop until they own all of it."
You haven't heard of the Silver-Blood family? They're the most important people in the Reach.
They practically own the city of Markarth. And we're here on their coin.
"That won't be the last we hear from the Silver-Bloods, but at least we can get back to work."
Thank you. You've done a good thing for me and my workers. Here. This is for you.
"Good, that must be very comfortable for you. I think mine's a bit too small. Perhaps we could trade?"
Sigh.
"Haelga, I like you, so I'm only going to say this one time."
"If you ever try and [QUOTE]practice the Dibellan arts[QUOTE] with Hemming again, I'll make sure that pretty little face loses its beauty."
"He wasn't protesting, Maven."
Of course he wasn't you stupid whore; he's a man. Now I'm not going to warn you again. Is that clear?
Very well.
"Well, there's Ingun Black-Briar, Maven's daughter. Strange girl. She likes to spend time down in Elgrim's Elixirs working on her alchemy."
"Then you have Hemming, Maven's son; spoiled brat and heir to her empire. He follows her word like a loyal dog follows its master."
"And finally, Sibbi; the worst of all of them. He's in Riften Jail for murder."
Wait... you mean I should just... tell her? Tell her how I feel?
"If that's what she wants, then that's what she'll get."
There is one... Yngvar. He's quite popular with the ladies.
"Thankfully Faleen is not quite his type, but they've been friends for some time, and he may have some ideas."
"Please, ask him what she likes. It's my only chance."
Very funny.
I'm sure you've noticed that Winterhold isn't exactly overflowing with people.
"So I'll sell whatever I can. If it's worth putting a price on, you can bet I'll do it."
"I've been burned a few times, made a few bad deals, but mostly I come out on top."
"Yeah, it was stupid of me."
"I shouldn't have believed the story and just refused the trade. But I didn't, and now I'm stuck with this worthless junk."
Some line about this claw thing and Yngol Barrow. He said it was worth more than its weight in gold if I took it back there.
"Something about placing it back in Yngol's chamber, I don't know."
"What was I thinking? Even if it were true, I'm not setting foot in some ancient tomb, filled with who knows what."
"I don't even care any more. You want to check it out? Fine. I'll sell you the thing for fifty gold, and then it's your problem."
"Fine, here you go."
"You get killed on account of this thing, it's not my fault. Got it?"
"But, I suppose, if it does actually turn out to be worth something, let me know, will you?"
"Oh, I'd gladly sell it to you if you had the money."
"But you don't, do you?"
"I told you, I know everything about this castle."
"For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard."
"How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you."
Excellent work.
"Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know."
It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal.
"Everyone in town knows about the Black Door, and to never go near it."
"Whatever you do, stay away from that Black Door. Being near it chills you to the bones."
Did you hear? People have been seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Divines have mercy.
I've heard that shadowy figures are being seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Gods help us.
"You there! As an officer of the Imperial Legion, I require your assistance to complete my mission."
"You there, hold! If you are a true friend to Skyrim, you will help me in my mission."
Are you going to help me with my mission? I need someone very capable.
My coat? What do you need my coat for?
What?! This is exactly why... don't they understand it's hard enough to fight a war without these juvenile attempts to undermine authority?
If you say so. If this were anyone but you I would lock them up.
"Take it. Take the coat, have your fun. I'll see you at the festival."
Get out of here!
This is my treasure!
I'm not kidding. I'll hurt you!
I am waiting for a good death.
"If you are not here to grant me a good death, then you can leave."
"Yes. Were I to simply lay down and die, it would not please Malacath."
My time has come. I am old. Too old to become chief. It would be wrong for me to take wives at this age. So I will die.
Malacath has given me a vision of a glorious death. I am to wait here until it finds me.
"As you can see, it has not yet arrived."
Perhaps...
Are you sure about this?
Hmm. We shall see.
Indeed. One should find his death while he can still call himself a proper man.
We Orc men are not like these Nords and Imperials who carry on until they are grey and feeble and their hair falls out.
"To cling to something past its usefulness is unseemly, how much more so when that thing is you?"
You should leave. I don't want you scaring off my good death.
Take this and hold onto it. I'll be back for it later. I'll pay you good. Don't lose it.
Did you see someone run past just now?
"You're passing through Solitude? Maybe you're looking to make some easy gold, yes?"
"With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters."
"We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner."
"The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground."
No time to talk. Snitch or double-cross me and I'll kill you. I mean it!
"What an interesting idea. I think if someone were to do something like that, there would definitely be a certain amount of loot to be shared..."
"Yes, if someone were to put out the Lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot."
"Ha! I'm afraid the loot's already been moved. You've been useful to the Blackbloods, though. You've earned a quick death."
"Well, if you do, grab him and yell. Bastard stole from me."
Great! Thanks! Bastard stole from me. I'll catch him though!
"Yes! How'd you get this? Never mind, here. It's not much, but its something."
I'm going to track down that thief and murder him!
I think we're almost out. Come on!
Let's take our time. I think we can sneak by her if we're careful.
We must be near the entrance for that bear to have made its den here.
I'll follow your lead.
Easy does it.
Not now.
I hate those things. Too many eyes or something.
Looks like we're on our own now.
"Since nobody's trying to kill me just now, maybe we should rest for a minute."
Let's see if we can find a way out of here.
We'd better stick together down here.
I'm glad to be out of that place. I hope this leads somewhere.
These bastards call themselves Imperial Legionnaires...
Come on. Sounds like trouble.
Look around. Grab anything that looks useful.
"There may be a way out, down this way."
I guess that'll teach me to try to reason with a Stormcloak.
Let's see where this goes. We can't be the only survivors.
Find yourself a weapon. You're going to need it.
We'd better get out of here. I don't think this place is going to stand up to much more of this.
"Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow."
I can't decide if things are about to get worse or better.
"At least we don't have a dragon to worry about, for the moment."
I think we're almost out. Come on!
"Take it slow and careful, and I think we can sneak by her."
We must be near the entrance for that bear to make its den here.
I'll follow your lead.
"I've got your back, don't worry."
Not now.
Biggest damn spiders I've ever seen.
The others'll have to find another way out.
This is the longest day I can remember.
Let's see if we can find a way out of here.
We'd better stick together down here.
I sure hope there's a way out somewhere down here.
Here's the noble Empire in all its glory. Pah.
Come on!
Look around. Grab anything useful.
"There may be a way out, down this way."
We'd better get moving before any more Imperials show up.
Let's see where this goes. Better than going back outside with that dragon.
Get yourself a weapon. I'm going to need your help if we run into any more Imperials.
We've got to find a way out of here.
"Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow."
I don't think this day is ever going to end.
Better in here than out there.
Help us and you may earn a pardon.
"Hey, weren't you on the carts with the Stormcloaks?"
"Ah, well, if Hadvar vouches for you I guess it must be all right."
I saw Caius.. that dragon just grabbed him and... I don't know how I made it out of there...
Nothing for it but to keep moving.
Better down here than out there.
A dragon.... First in a thousand years....
We need to find a way out of here.
What?
Worry about yourself.
Thank Talos you came along... I thought I was going to die down here.
Imperial dogs... there's nothing that's too low for them.
"You were with us on the carts, weren't you? Not your lucky day, eh?"
I wonder if there's any more Imperials hiding down here somewhere.
Ralof seems to like you. That's good enough for me.
What do you make of it... the dragon? What does it mean?
What next?
I hope someone knows where we're going.
Better down here than out there.
Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.
There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket.
"So, you in for a little fishin'?"
"Sure, I've got a mark for you. Stole something quite important from a friend of the Guild and we take care of our own. You in?"
One of our marks seems to have an item of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?
"Got ourselves a freelancer thinks he can muscle in on our territory. How about you teach him some manners, eh?"
"Maven wants this mark's most prized possession. The bloody fool carries it on his person all the time. So, think you can handle it?"
"Brynjolf want's this mark's head on a pike, but we'll settle for what the bastard's carryin' instead. Can I count on you?"
Got a mark taxed with carryin' a heavy item. Care to lighten' the load?
This brilliant soul decided to pick a fight with a fellow Guild mate. Time for them to pay the piper. Will you help out?
I've got a mark who just got an item from a relative outside of Skyrim. They probably should have been quieter about it. You in?
Most of the establishments in Skyrim keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers.
Your job would be to change the numbers in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit.
Feel like doing a bit of writin'?
"This business is a regular target for the Guild. They keep pretty shoddy records, so the job should be a cinch. You in?"
We want to waylay a shipment on the way from this business without them even noticin' anything went missin'. Want the job?
"Yeah, sure. Got a business on tap that could use a little number rearrangin'. What do you say?"
"Okay, got just the one for you. Ledger's just beggin' to be changed and the Guild could use the coin. How about it?"
"Have a client lookin' to have a rival's business ledger changed. Don't know the reason, and don't want to know. Count you in?"
"Got a personal request from Brynjolf on this numbers job. He says we may hit 'em hard later, and wants to prep their books. Help us out?"
"These marks keep their ledger all neat and tidy, but they're ripe for some change if you know what I mean. Take it?"
"All right. Got a simple one. Just get in, change the books and be back in time for last call. So how's about it?"
Feels good to be mining again.
How can you say that? This mine was filled with draugr not too long ago.
"I feel like any moment, a draugr is going to come and chop my head off."
Steel your nerves. The draugr are gone. Focus on your mining.
Those draugr are going to come up and kill us all.
They haven't moved out of the caves. I think we're safe.
[QUOTE]We're safe[QUOTE] he says. You'll eat those words when a draugr is tearing into your face.
The guards say no draugr have come out of the mine.
That's comforting. Glad they're keeping watch instead of getting rid of the draugr.
Those draugr are going to be back. I can feel it.
Don't be such a coward. We haven't seen any draugr since the mine was cleared. Be grateful.
I don't think it's safe mining a cave on top of that crypt.
"There's a war on. We need every scrap of ore we can get, so we're going to keep digging. Understand?"
"Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you."
"When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way."
"We send you to plant some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself."
Sound like you can handle it?
Someone wants to see this mark suffer. They're paying a good bit of coin to have us plant the evidence in their house. You in?
"This one should be easy. Get in, plant the goods and get out. Quiet and neat. Sound like your kind of job?"
The mark must have ticked-off our client badly. He's impatient and keeps asking if the job's done. Can you get him off my back?
Got a good one here. Personal score to settle between myself and this mark. You up for it?
Brynjolf finally got some dirt on the mark and the evidence to back it up. Think you can give him a hand?
This one angered someone pretty high up in the keep. Can I count on you to get this done for me?
Got another personal score to settle and I'd consider it a favor if you'd take the job. Think you can help me out?
"Sure, sure. Got one that should be pretty easy, as long as you keep your weapon sheathed. Can you handle it?"
Yeah. Someone ticked off Maven and she wants to teach them a lesson... our way. You in?
"Whoa, there. I don't know where you're going, but stay out of that mine. It isn't safe."
We tunneled into an old Nordic crypt. The whole place is crawling with draugr.
"We're not mining up any ore with those undead around, so I wouldn't go down there if I were you."
You did? We were waiting for the Jarl to send an entire regiment to clear that mine.
Now we can get back to work. Thank you.
I don't have to take this from the likes of you.
"Pretty simple. Break into a house, grab a specific item and get out before they realize what's going on."
The catch is you can't kill anyone who lives there or you forfeit the payment.
You ready for some good old-fashioned burglary?
"We're looking to recover an heirloom for a client. They claim ownership of it, and as long as they're paying we don't really care. You in?"
"We've been trying to get this item for a while, but no one with the skills has come along to claim it. Can I count on you to get it?"
"Have a house with a good bit of valuables inside, but one particular item's caught my eye. You up for it?"
Got a tip on a desirable item at this location. We want you to break in there and bring it to us. What do you think?
"Good, got a buyer in a rush for this item. If you hurry we can turn it around and make a quick profit. Can you get it?"
"Sure, sure. We're always looking to get our hands on items from all over Skyrim. How about this one?"
"As long as you can keep things quiet and don't get yourself killed in the process, this place has exactly what we're looking for. You in?"
"We've actually stolen this item before and somehow it ended up back in some other mark's house. Guess it's time to reclaim it, eh?"
"Ah, is there any weapon finer than an Orc blade?"
"No, mother. It's no wonder our enemies fear the sight of an Orc warrior."
The metal has been stubborn today. It refuses to bend.
Save your anger for the forge. The steel cannot hear your whining.
"Sorry, mother. I'll focus on my work."
Imagine the heads of your enemies as you forge. Let your hatred work the steel.
"Yes, mother."
You'll come of age soon. Time to be married to another chief.
I won't be married to some weak-willed Orc chieften. I'd sooner join the Legion.
I served in the Legion. Perhaps I'll show you some of their technique one of these days.
"Books. Don't know why the Imperials like these so much. This should help the boy, though, Malacath willing."
"Here, let me show you how an Orc learns to smith."
"Tacitus? Boy's an Imperial. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it."
"In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess."
"If you find a book called [QUOTE]The Last Scabbard of Akrash,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? Tacitus sure isn't learning by example."
Thanks.
Fair enough.
"Only that they break an old woman's heart. So many friends, so many kin, all lost trying to rebuild a past that was over long ago."
"Thank you. He can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your help."
Very well.
"That's enough, Thongvor. We're done."
"New to Skyrim? I was confused at first, too. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead."
It's where people in the city are buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.
Arkay. One of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death.
It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.
"All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway."
"We've discovered that some of the dead have been... eaten. Flesh has been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside."
We haven't caught anyone or anything yet. It's like it knows when I'm there.
"If you can get to the bottom of this, the Priesthood of Arkay will reward you. Take my key, and be careful."
"Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations."
That's not going to work.
Then my answer is the Hall of the Dead is closed. By order of the Jarl. Understand?
Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
"Tell me, why have you slain this one, who trusted you, here upon my shrine?"
"Tell me, why have you slain those who profess to follow in my ways?"
You were weak. Now you are dead. What signs have you left of your passing for us to remember you by?
A god? Assuredly not! Gods are weak and ineffectual. When was the last time you heard or saw evidence of the Aedra in the world?
"No, we Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared."
I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given me. But I am not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.
A god? Assuredly not! When was the last time you saw evidence of Aedra in the world?
"No, we Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared."
Is that so? You should be. Though a heart without fear is something I can use... Perhaps you are the one I seek.
We shall soon find out.
Arkay keep you and protect you.
You there. You another Imperial puppet? Answer me.
"What of it, he says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos."
"What of it, she says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos."
You can tell Jarl Igmund that the Silver-Blood family won't tolerate his cowardice for much longer.
"Finally, someone with decent sense. The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos."
Jarl Igmund can't ignore us for much longer. Not if the Silver-Blood family has a say.
There's a war on and you don't know what I'm talking about? The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for.
Jarl Igmund can refuse to see me all he wants. The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
That's a true Nord hero. A legend. So great that the Divines themselves lifted his soul into the heavens and made him a god.
"He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease the Elves. Elves! Do the Elves rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?"
"He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease your kind, Elf. Do your people rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?"
"We own Cidhna Mine. Best prison in Skyrim, and source of half the wealth in this city."
"We keep the Reach safe. We flood Markarth with wealth, but does the Jarl listen to us when we want a say? No."
"He's busy forgetting that Ulfric Stormcloak saved this city from the Forsworn. Ulfric's a hero, not a damn criminal."
They started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
"Now the Elves dictate everything we do, and they don't want us acknowledging a [QUOTE]mere human[QUOTE] like Talos as the god he is."
Your kind started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
Now you people dictate everything we do. Don't want us acknowledging a [QUOTE]mere human[QUOTE] like Talos as the god he is.
He used the Thu'um. Shouted those Forsworn from the walls. Then he led a band of Nord warriors in to take the city.
"Just like Talos himself at the Battle of Old Hroldan, reclaiming the Reach from those heathen natives."
What are you doing here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or guards.
Nchuand-Zel? The ruins underneath Markarth? The wealth of artifacts that I've based two human lifetimes of research on?
"Magic. That's what they always want. Never history. Never the secrets of the lost races. No, just little spells and enchantments."
I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always bother me when I'm trying to finish my research?
"You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me!"
"I... I'm sorry I... I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very... stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?"
Make sure that he is.
Make sure that she is.
"Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in Dead Man's Respite."
I need you to retrieve the poem.
"Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in the Dead Man's Respite."
I need you to retrieve the poem.
Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?
"I'm a mage, not a pawnbroker, you know."
"If it will help you, then certainly."
J'zargo only has so much room to carry things.
"No problem, I can carry a good bit of gear."
"Running out of room, eh? I'll be glad to help."
Do I get to keep it? Just kidding.
"I am an apprentice wizard, not a pack mule! Oh very well, but make it quick."
"Sure, feel free to hand me all the gold you want."
If that is what you wish.
"Sure, what have you got?"
No problem! How can I help?
(bark)
I am sworn to carry your burdens.
What do you want me to carry?
I'll shoulder some of your burden.
Need me to carry something?
"Fine. Let's trade, then."
What do you need to take?
Finally. Now get lost.
"Oh, thank you! Divines bless your kind heart."
I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
"I have a purpose for which you might prove useful. But first I must test the deftness of your guile, and the strength of your purpose."
"Make a thrall. Lure him to my shrine. Prove your will is stronger. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice, and then slay him without mercy."
"Do this and I shall remember you and bestow an important task upon you. Do this not, and I shall forget you, and your soul will waste in obscurity."
"Well, he's quite obviously mad. Whether or not that makes him dangerous is another question entirely."
Do I trust him? Not in the slightest.
"Well, well. You've slain my followers. I should destroy you for your impudence!"
"On the other hand, you've weeded out the weak from among those who would deign worship me."
"You could be the one I seek... if your will is strong, lure a thrall to my shrine. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice. Then slay him."
"Do this, and I shall favor you."
If we could get into the Thalmor Embassy... it's the center of their operations in Skyrim...
"Problem is, that place is locked up tighter than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about paranoia..."
What? Something you're still confused about?
Not here. Downstairs.
"The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor."
"I can get you into one of those parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find Elenwen's secret files."
"I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you."
"His name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You can trust him."
"I'll get word for him to meet you in Solitude, at the Winking Skeever -- you know it?"
"While you're doing that, I'll work on getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party."
Meet me at the Solitude stables after you've arranged things with Malborn. Any questions?
Orgnar. I'm travelling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.
Right. Happy trails.
"I believe she's trying to look as ravishing as possible for you, milord."
"Oh, well... I suppose that's a noble cause. I'll settle this bill at the end of the day. Thank you."
"Grelka, I wanted to talk about that suit of leather armor you sold me. The fasteners are already coming loose."
Fine. It'll be five septims to repair it.
Why should I pay for a repair on something I just bought?
"All right, all right. Just bring it to me tomorrow and I'll fix it for you."
"Grelka, how fast can you get your hands on some longbows?"
"I don't usually deal in weapons, but I know someone who can get them for me. You mind paying a little extra to get them fast?"
I don't care what it costs. I need four longbows and four score of arrows. Just make it happen.
I'll contact my man tonight and let you know what he says.
Aerin tells me you might be dealing arms to the Thieves Guild. Is this true?
I don't know what he's talking about. He must be seeing things.
"I'm watching you, Grelka. One slip up and I report you to the guards. You got that?"
Whatever you say.
"Did you do everything I said, Shadr?"
Yes. The man came by at noon just like you said. I gave him the package and he gave me this pouch for you.
The package was heavy... I needed his help getting it on his horse. What was inside?
"Hey, I told you not to ask any questions. Now, here. For your trouble."
Hmm. There's no simple answer to that. You want the long version or the short version?
"When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat."
"They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect her against the Thalmor."
"When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat."
"They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect him against the Thalmor."
"We hurt them in the past, and they have long memories."
"Thanks, Grelka!"
"So while I was in Ivarstead, I heard news that something terrible happened at Helgen."
You've heard too? They say the town was completely destroyed by a dragon.
"If that's true, then we have much more to fear than the Thieves Guild."
I'd still keep an eye on my purse if I was you.
"Dinya, about that incense you requested? Its not arriving anytime soon. The Khajiit caravans are having tough times getting through."
That's a shame. What's causing them all the trouble?
"There's the stories about Helgen, bandits, skirmishes between the Stormcloaks and the Imperials... it almost seems endless."
"Chin up, Brand-Shei. Lady Mara will provide us strength and guidance through these difficult times."
"Has the Thieves Guild visited you yet, Haelga?"
"They haven't been by the Bunkhouse, but I'm certain they will. How about you?"
"No. I'm surprised actually. I thought they had a stranglehold on the city, but in the last few years, it hasn't been that bad."
"Perhaps they moved on to greener pastures. Whatever the reason, lets be glad they're scarce."
"Well met, Brand-Shei. I've come by to browse your wares today."
Is it true you chased a thief from your home? I overheard Aerin mentioning it.
It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the Red Mountain.
Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.
Brand-Shei... have you managed to find those boots for me?
What's with all the boots and shoes you keep buying? You must have bought twenty pairs in the last two years.
"Always be prepared. You never know if you might get a split in one, or lose one, then where would you be? No sir, that's not happening to me."
"Um... okay. Well, the boots aren't here yet. Hopefully on the next Khajiit caravan."
"Thanks for that bushel of apples, Marise. They're wonderful. How did you keep them so fresh?"
Can't tell you. It's a bit of a trade secret I picked up when I was living in High Rock.
"Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it and you'll have me as a customer for life."
I'm afraid it's going to be a while before I can get any more Goldenglow Honey.
I thought it was strange that Aringoth stopped coming into town. I suppose he's having some difficulties out there.
"May I ask what all the honey's for? I mean, you used to buy almost a jar a week. Are you cooking or something?"
In a manner of speaking.
Hey. What's the matter with you? You have no right to spread rumors around town about me.
What rumors?
You know very well what I'm talking about. You're saying that I only married Bolli for his gold and that I don't really love him.
"Well, if the shoe fits..."
Oh! Miss Maven. What can I do for you?
"Relax, Marise... I have no quarrel with you. I just wish to speak a moment."
Yes?
"You watch the market, you hear the rumors around Riften. What have you heard about these dragons?"
I heard a traveler say that Helgen was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.
Interesting. Keep your ears open for me and tell me if you hear anything more. I'll make it worth your while.
Maven. How's the criminal underworld treating you this fine day?
"You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to."
"You're a cold, unfeeling bitch."
"My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt."
"I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall."
At this loss...
We weep.
We weep.
We weep.
We weep.
We grieve.
We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.
Let's go. We need to get to the Western Watchtower before it's too late.
I'll see you at the watchtower as soon as the rest of the men have gathered.
Follow me. We're assembling near the main gate.
Talos save us! It's a dragon!
"But remember, you're still oathbound to our cause. Skyrim still waits to be free."
Krif krin. Pruzah!
Thurri du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
Brit grah. I had forgotten what fine sport you mortals can provide!
You are brave. Balaan hokoron. Your defeat brings me honor.
Zok morokei! More souls to feed my master's hunger.
Dovahkiin! No!!
I can't believe it! You're... Dragonborn...
"There's no refusing a summons from the Greybeards. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your power."
You heard the summons. What else could it mean?
The Greybeards...
So it's true. The Greybeards really were summoning you.
Not just the men. The Greybeards seem to think the same thing.
Masters of the Way of the Voice. They live in seclusion high on the slopes of the Throat of the World.
"The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout."
"The Greybeards are masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift."
Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun?
"That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar!"
"This hasn't happened in ... centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!"
That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets back. Now then...
"The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it. Also, never doubt me or Galmar. Now then..."
Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere. Never forget that...  I trust you gave them a thrashing? Now then...
We shout.
We shout.
We shout.
We shout.
And for ourselves...
We take our leave.
We take our leave.
We take our leave.
We take our leave.
"I'm sorry you disapprove, father. But I've made up my mind. I'm not a warrior, I'm a businessman."
The only reason you have the gold for your [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] is because I gave it to you.
"I'll pay you back, if it means that much."
"It's not about the coin, it's about honoring your legacy by picking up arms and keeping this land free."
"The sooner you remember that, the better."
"Haelga, we need to stop seeing each other."
"Oh, Bolli you silly man. You weren't saying that when you were licking that honey off my..."
Haelga! That's just it. I can't keep up with you. Your Dibellan techniques... they're exhausting.
"Is it really me, or is it your wife? You need to make a choice Bolli. The honey or her."
When are you going to take me away from here Bolli?
"I told you, I can't just pick up and leave. I have my wife, my business... not to mention you have the Bunkhouse."
"That old place? I could care less about it. Its you I want, Bolli."
"I... I'm sorry Haelga, I can't. Not yet."
Sometimes I'm not certain that the people of Riften want to be helped.
"I think some of them do, Lady Mjoll. They're just too frightened to step up and do something about it like you are."
"Aerin, you never cease to amaze me. You always see the good in everything."
It's only because I've had an excellent teacher.
"Gretta, Engar, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Imperial reinforcements taking us by surprise."
"So, what do you think of my plan. You in or out?"
This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.
I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....
The rest of you lot are with me.
"If you think I'd would make a move like that without asking Maven, you're out of your mind. Doing that would be a fatal mistake."
"Come on, think about it. She'd reward us!"
"If you want to go out to Whiterun and burn that meadery down, go right ahead."
"And when the guard traces it back here, and Maven is implicated, I'll be sure to tell her it was your idea."
"I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for."
So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?
Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?
Shor's Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.
"Don't worry, I'll treat those shipments as if I owned them myself."
Did he now? I can only hope.
"You still have the witches' heads? Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their magic, for me at least."
"You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak reinforcements taking us by surprise."
"Everyone else, with me."
"Yes, my lord."
"No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure."
"Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it."
"Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there."
I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.
"One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with."
Good. Don't fail me.
"Keeping busy, Sergius?"
As always. The Nords don't ever stop wanting things enchanted.
At least it's more money for the College.
"Perhaps, but it just means more work for me."
"Do you think you might, err, have a moment to look at something for me?"
"If this is another dwarven trinket, I keep telling you I'm not familiar with them."
"Yes, I just thought perhaps you'd have, err, come across something like this before."
"Why, because I'm a Dunmer? We didn't all grow up in dwarven ruins, you know."
"Well, err, yes. Sorry to have troubled you."
"Hello, Nirya."
"Don't even talk to me, Gane."
"Ah, err, yes. Sorry."
I've had yet another complaint. Please stop barging in on experiments in progress.
"My dear, I am merely observing the proceedings."
Well then [QUOTE]observe[QUOTE] from a greater distance. You're making people uncomfortable.
"How are you, Drevis?"
Ugh. What do you want?
Why should I want anything? Why can't I simply be sociable with my colleagues?
"I'm busy right now, Colette."
"Well, then. Fine. Have a nice day."
"What are you up to, Gane? Hmm?"
"What? Err, nothing!"
Some days I marvel that you haven't managed to blow yourself up.

"If you see Karliah, don't hesitate. Kill her."
"That's enough of this unnecessary chatting, we need to keep going."
Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.
Have your weapon at the ready. I'm certain Karliah knows we're here.
Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
"When you're ready, meet me at Snow Veil Sanctum."
"Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place. I fear for the security of the very land if it should break free."
"We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand."
"I have been holding him here. While he regains strength, however, I am fading."
"By now I can barely contain his power, much less defeat him if he awakens. But with the help of a living champion I may be able to succeed."
"You would do this? Three vessels in the tomb below hold the power to vanquish Hevnoraak. Before anything else, we need those."
"Bring them to me - but be careful, mortal. They are guarded by Hevnoraak's minions. They will stop at nothing to see their master return."
You've found the vessels. I worried that I had sent you to your death.
(Heavy breathing)
(Heavy breathing)
(Heavy breathing)
"I'm proud to be your battle-brother, Dragonborn. Whiterun doesn't need to fear with you on our side."
"You sure took care of that dragon. Dragonborn or not, that's good enough for me."
I can't believe we actually killed a dragon!
Dragonborn... it's an honor.
You saved Whiterun today. We won't forget.
Is it really dead?
"Come on, I want a better look at that thing."
"We taught that dragon not to mess with Whiterun, didn't we?"
I'm glad you're on our side.
Get under cover! The dragon - it's still around somewhere!
I'm glad you're coming with us. They say Talos favors you.
That dragon should've stuck with killing Imperials. Now he's going to learn how real Nords fight.
My cousin's stationed out at the watchtower. I hope he's all right.
I doubt any of us are coming back from this mission.
"With Irileth, you either come back covered with glory or not at all."
You really think we can kill a dragon?
I'm looking forward to testing myself against this dragon.
I hear you faced a dragon at Helgen and lived to tell about it. That ain't nothing.
We'd better keep moving. Who knows what that dragon is doing.
I hope the tower holds out until we get there.
This doesn't look good.
"Shor's bones, did it kill them all...?"
We'd better find out what's happened.
We'd better keep moving.
Good luck. I hope you get there in time.
Hold on. I want to hear what Irileth's saying.
"That may be true, but I ordered Irileth to bring back proof. You'd best report back to her at once."
We'd better go make sure that bastard is really dead. Collect us a trophy or something to bring back to Ulfric.
"Scatter and get behind cover! We need to hurt it, somehow! If you've got a bow or spells, now would be a good time to use them!"
"That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few."
"I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us."
You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.
I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.
Be careful. We need to find out what happened here.
"If you really are Dragonborn, then Skyrim needs you. Go to High Hrothgar and talk to the Greybeards."
"You've done a great service for me and my city, Dragonborn."
So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?
Help Irileth kill this dragon before it can attack Whiterun. There's no time to lose.
"There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again."
I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon.
"You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here."
Not now.
I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than that.
Dragonborn? What do you know about the Dragonborn?
There's no question about that. It was a mighty deed. You've earned a place of honor among the heroes of Whiterun.
But there must be more to it than that. Did something... strange... happen when the dragon died?
Very well. Meet me at the summoning circle in the marsh at dawn. We shall banish the creature you have become.
Which is utterly useless at the moment. You need to fill it with a soul.
"Good, you're here."
As you desire.
Stand in the center of the circle.
I call upon Oblivion realms. The home of those who are not our ancestors. Answer my plea!
"As in death there is new life, in Oblivion there is a beginning for that which has ended."
I call forth that power! Accept the soul that we offer!
The ritual is complete.
You are human again. Like the rest of us.
You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.
"If you're going after those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town."
You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.
"Oh really? Well, I'm not going to hold my breath."
"The thieves are up in Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town. I'd take you there, but with Lucan gone, I'm busy with the store."
Still no word from your family?
"No, and I'm not expecting any."
Really? That must be so nice. I came all the way to Skyrim just to get away from my family's expectations.
My family didn't really approve of me coming here at all.
"Oh. Well, that's... awkward. Sorry to have brought it up."
Have you heard from your family recently?
"No, not really. Couriers don't seem to like delivering letters here."
"Ah, that's too bad."
Not at all. It means I'm not being hounded about my progress at the College.
J'zargo continues to struggle with wards. You have time to practice?
Maybe later. I'm sort of busy now.
J'zargo understands. You hesitate because you know J'zargo will be better than you. Very well.
Jarl Balgruuf is waiting.
"You're the one that got out of Helgen, aren't you? I could use anyone who's tangled with a dragon before."
Where do you think you'll be the most help - scouting ahead or supporting the rest of my men?
Well? You going to scout ahead or travel with me?
Good enough. We'll meet up near the watchtower. Don't take any chances until we get there.
"Well, I suppose I could use a hand with something, yes."
"Faralda's working on something, and I want to know what it is."
"I want her notes. You think you could get them for me, without her knowing?"
"Yes, yes it is."
You have a problem with that?
"Look, either you get the notes or I'll figure out another way to do it. Just come find me if you can get your hands on them."
I'll throw some money at you. Good enough?
"Just get the notes and bring them to me. If you can't do it, I'll find some other way to manage it."
"I'm still waiting for those notes, if you can get them."
She what?
"Oh, I should've known she'd try it again!"
Thanks for warning me. I'll see to it this is taken care of.
"Good, good. She didn't see you take them?"
"Al right, this should be enough to figure out what she's up to. Then I can make sure it doesn't work."
"Good work. Here, take this, and keep quiet."
It's the Imperials! Take cover!
It's the escaped prisoners!
Get this gate open.
"People of Riften, heed my words. The return of the dragons is not mere coincidence."
This is one of the signs. The signs that Lady Mara is displeased with your constant inebriation.
"No, no... Maramal... we talked about this. Talen..."
Put down your flagons filled with your vile liquids and embrace the teachings of the handmaiden of Kyne.
"Keerava, certainly we can come to some sort of an understanding. These people must be made aware of the chaos they've sown."
"Enough, Maramal. We've all heard of the dragons and their return. There's no need to use them as an excuse to harass our customers."
"Very well, Talen. I'll remove myself from this den of iniquity."
"We're not kicking you out, just keep the sermons at the temple and let us all sin in peace."
Well done. They never knew what hit them.
"We had the advantage of surprise this time, but don't expect it to last. Let's move out."
Now let's keep moving.
"Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier."
Get the crown already. We don't need to hang around here any longer than necessary.
"The crown should be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open."
It's the Legion!
Imperials! Kill them!
The Legion is here! Defend the entrance!
"We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support."
"This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only."
"Ah, Viarmo.  I assume you are here to petition for the reinstatement of the Burning of King Olaf Festival."
"I am, Jarl. I wish to present King Olaf's verse from the Poetic Edda. Recovered this very day from the Bards Tomb."
"Ah, you mentioned something that would convince us the festival should take place but I didn't expect King Olaf's lost verse. Please proceed."
I would not sell it to just anyone but I'll make an exception for you. The cost to replace the gem is quite high.
I believe this gem is worth more than you are at the moment.
I would hate to see our reputation further tarnished.
Very good. I hope this will allow us to maintain our reputation.
You've been suspended from the College for what you did. You'd better talk to Tolfdir if you want to get it sorted out.
"I'm sorry, but you've been suspended from the College. I can't be seen talking to you right now."
It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone.
"When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire."
I met several of your kind during my studies of life-extending magics. I even  considered becoming a vampire myself.
"In the end, vampirism would endanger my ward Agni which would defeat the intended purpose."
"They are rare things, I have one I picked up during my research of the Oblivion realms but it is a precious item."
"They say Falion of Morthal has studied vampires, draugr and all matter of undead."
Here's the situation.
A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.
You heard right! I said a dragon!
I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!
"That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle."
Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?
"But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families."
But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?
Yeah!
Damn right!
Yeah!
"He's a bard, so he says. Occasionally he finds time to do his job here at the mill."
Thinks his ballads and sonnets are going to convince Camilla Valerius to marry him. As if she would say [QUOTE]yes.[QUOTE]
"An intelligent, beautiful woman like her wouldn't fall for that nonsense... I hope."
I've been thinking... maybe Camilla needs a little help seeing Sven for what he is.
"I don't need your jokes right now, but maybe you have a point. Maybe Camilla needs some help seeing Sven for what he is."
"Could you... could you give her this letter, and say it's from Sven? I think I've matched that Nord's lack of cleverness perfectly."
"Another poem, I'll bet. He does know how to make a girl blush."
"What's this? If that oaf thinks all I'm going to do is stay in that filthy house of his and clean, I'll...."
You can tell Sven that he already has a mother. I'm not speaking to him anymore.
He what? What are you talking about?
Why that jealous idiot. Thought he could just manipulate me into never seeing Sven again?
"Thank you for telling me the truth. You should speak to Sven. I'm sure he'll want to thank you, too, for defending his name."
What is this? The elf playing at treachery? Shocking.
As if I would write this dribble. How about we play a bit of turnabout with Faendal?
"Here. I had to use simple words, but this letter should convince Camilla it's from him."
"You may be right. Camilla may see Faendal as little more than a friend, but why take chances?"
Here. Give Camilla this letter. It's full of venomous nonsense. Tell her it's from Faendal.
Camilla Valerius knows I'm the best man in Riverwood. That elf is kidding himself if he thinks she would choose him over me.
I've seen him sneaking over to the Riverwood Trader to speak with her when I'm not around. He's wasting his time.
Is that sarcasm? I've heard better wisecracks from Orgnar.
"Still, you have a point. Camilla letting Faendal visit her isn't a good thing for me."
"Here, let me give you a particularly venomous letter. Say it's from Faendal. That should get Camilla to stop inviting the elf over."
What is that blowhard up to now?
"So, he thinks he can turn Camilla against me? Two can play at this."
Here. Give this letter to Camilla and tell her it's from Sven. Let's see what she thinks of him after reading that.
From Faendal? That's strange. He's never written to me before.
"What, what is this? Is this what he really thinks about me?"
"Well, you can tell that... that long-eared ass not to come around the store anymore. He's not welcome."
What are you talking about? What's in the letter?
Oh my. He... he wanted me to think Faendal wrote this?
"Thank you for telling me the truth. Could you talk to Faendal, as well?  I'm sure he'll want to thank you for standing up for him."
Now that's what I like to hear. Good work. I think you deserve some gold from my tips at the inn.
"I appreciate your help. Please, take this. Some gold I've saved up from working at the mill."
If that's what you want. Come find me at the College if you change your mind.
You'll be all right on your own? Then I'll see you back at the College.
"Really? J'zargo was having such fun. Ah, well. Back to the College then."
"I understand. We must all follow our own paths. If you wish to find me again, I'll be in Nightcaller Temple."
Such a shame. I thought we were getting along so well. I'll head back to Riften if you should have second thoughts.
"Farewell, then. If you need my services again, just come and look for me in the usual place."
"So you think you can make it on your own, then? We'll just see about that."
"If that's what you want. Watch your back out there, and if you need me again, you know where I'll be."
"It is a lonely thing, facing all the dangers of Skyrim by yourself. Come and find me if you decide that you miss my companionship."
"You're letting me go? What's wrong, is my skill with a blade making you look bad? Hah! I'm kidding, friend. Until we meet again!"
"Well, it's been fun. I guess I'll head back to Rorikstead."
"I will be back at your house if you need me, Thane."
(whine)
I'll head back home if you need me.
Then back home is where you'll find me.
"I'll be heading home, then, if you need me."
"You need my strength again, I'll be home."
I'm heading home if you need me.
"Yes. Congratulations, you are now a full-fledged member of the Bards College."
Due to your adventurous nature several of the college professors have some things they wish you to do.
"What's more, Elisif has declared the Burning of King Olaf should become a weekly event."
"And finally, there's the matter of the Patronage that Elisif wanted me to give you."
Ah the bard-to-be. Did Viarmo send you?
Not many come to see me. What do you want?
"I know many things. I have studied things beyond the reach of most humans, traveled the Oblivion planes, seen things one should not see."
I have met Daedra and Dwemer and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man.
I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in Ustengrav.
Good. The whole point of being in hiding is to appear to be someone you're not.
The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door.
"The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak."
Let him guide your path.
I have vowed to serve Amaund Motierre until my dying breath. Best remember that.
Here.
"Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family since I was a child. I trust the man with my life."
Rexus. The items.
Poor Cicero. Dear Cicero. Such a humble servant. But he will never hear my voice. For he is not the Listener.
Somethin' ya need? Anything for the guild.
"Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited."
Oh. Oh I see.
"Well, you're makin' friends all over, ain't ya?"
"So, uh... how is Astrid doing' these days? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up."
"Ah, but business! Of course. What kind of business?"
Oh. Oh I see.
"Well now, how is Astrid doin' these days, uh? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up."
"Ah, but we can discuss that later, yeah? What does the Brotherhood need?"
Let's see...
Where oh where did you get this? Don't answer - I don't want to know.
This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council. Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't somethin' you'd give up lightly.
"Look, it ain't my business ta tell the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the Elder Council, you'd better belie-"
Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet?
"Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed."
Wait just one moment...
"Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only, for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement."
You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.
"Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet authentic?"
The Elder Council...
"Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise beyond your station. Delicious."
Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?

It's always good to see someone I can count on.
The general expects so much with so little.
"The sooner we end this rebellion, the sooner I'll be able to sleep at night."
Ulfric... what have you done my old friend?
Stormcloaks... even the name of their rebellion stinks of Ulfric's vanity. He wants to be king. That's all this is about. One man's ambition.
"I don't fight for the glory of the Empire, nor do I glory in the death of my kinsmen. I fight to bring peace and order to my homeland."
Damnit! Why can't Ulfric see he's tearing Skyrim to pieces?
Sometimes I wonder if the gods have abandoned us... as we have abandoned them.
"What I do, I do for Skyrim and her people."
"When we destroy the rebellion, perhaps the Thalmor will call off their damned inquisitions. It's just making things worse."
Sometimes I miss being out there in the middle of the action.

Always good to see someone I can trust.
Sometimes I wonder if Ulfric understands what I'm dealing with out here.
That godless Emperor can shove his damn treaty into the steaming nether-reaches of my you-know-where.
My hatred for the Empire is exceeded only by my hatred for their witch-elf puppet-masters.
What will Skyrim have become if her children submitted to tyranny?
"The Empire would have us become their slaves as they have become slaves to the Thalmor. I will not live as a slave, nor will I die as one."
The Empire is weak. That is why we fight them. Skyrim must be ruled by the strong.
Some say Ulfric desires to be king and nothing more... have they not seen that his anger floats on a sea of tears?
"Countless dead haunt countless sleepless nights... when Skyrim becomes whole again, perhaps so will I."
"When we've reclaimed our homeland from the Imperials, we'll take the fight to the Thalmor. They are the true enemy. Make no mistake."
"If there was someone else Ulfric could trust with all this planning nonsense, I'd be out there breaking heads with the rest of you."

Skyrim is the birth place of the Empire. We won't let a bunch of thugs rob her of her lineage.
"General Tullius expects much of me, and thus I expect much of my men."
In these grave times each Legionnaire must be his better self at all times and under all conditions.
"The Empire is man's last bastion. If Ulfric wasn't blinded by lust for power, he'd see we are on the same side."
"Were the Stormcloaks to prevail in dismantling Imperial rule in Skyrim, who would be her protector? No. We will crush this rebellion. We must do."
Ulfric would expunge from Skyrim citizens whose only crime was to be born of a non-Nordic woman. That is unacceptable to free men everywhere.
"Every Legionnaire's secret weapon lies in this: knowledge of himself. And like any blade, he must be forged between the hammer and the anvil."
"On the coldest of nights, in the steam rising from my breath, I see the many faces of the dead."
"We stand out here in the cold, as brothers, warmed by the knowledge that we fight for the rights of every free citizen of the Empire."
Unblooded.

Look deeply into the faces of the warriors around you. These are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim. See her strength and nobility in their eyes.
The Empire would have us become slaves to the Thalmor. We are not slaves. We are men. Free men who will slay anyone who begs to differ.
"It was anger that brought each of us here, but it is love that keeps us fighting."
"The measure of a man is taken at the moment of his death. And know this for truth, the ghosts of many heroes walk among us."
One lives for the things he is willing to die for.
My hatred for the Empire is bested only by love for my countrymen.
The Emperor would turn Skyrim into a puppet of the Dominion. I for one would not care to dance for the amusement of those foul elves.
"That we have forgotten them, this I fear the gods will remember."
"Before we wage war upon our foes, we must wage a war against our lesser selves. Cleave to your higher voice and with it shatter your foes."
I'll fight the entire Legion myself if they dare show their faces here.
"Legion soldiers gleam like fresh-fallen snow and clank like a kitchen. They head this way, we'll know it."
"I long to be out there, with my brothers, waging war against the Empire."
Keep an eye out for Stormcloak spies.
"Been so long since I killed a Stormcloak, my sword arm's getting flabby."
Stay alert. Never know when those Stormcloak dogs might charge.
Did I ever tell you about the day when Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger?
I can't imagine Skald ever being young.
"Oh, he was young, and handsome. I had half a mind to go after him, myself, before I met my husband."
"Frida, you aren't saying...."
"I was a beauty in my day, dearie. Don't act so surprised."
Dawnstar has always held its own against the bandits and wild animals of the Pale.
"Did you ever have to fight off bandits, Frida? Like in your stories?"
"Why, I once fought alongside your father when we were both younger. Saved him from getting his fool head sliced off."
Who were you fighting against?
"Oh, dearie, it was so long ago. But I do remember the celebration we had afterwards. Mead never tasted so good."
"Thoring, do you remember the time when that wolf pack come clamoring into town?"
How could I forget? That old alpha male almost took off my leg.
Never did find out why they came sprawling into town like that.
Animals in the Pale don't need a reason to attack Dawnstar. It's just their nature.
"Now, who was it that kidnapped the Jarl's son 20 years ago?"
You mean Hildolf the Skull-Splitter? Remember when we rounded up the townspeople and dragged him out of that cave?
Those were the days. I'd never seen my husband fight so bravely before.
"Aye, to your husband. Divines bless his memory."
Tough day at the mines. I swear the ore is getting harder to dig.
You're just getting older.
That's why I come here to talk to you. You're all heart.
You should quit working in the Eastern Mine. Leigelf's no good to work for.
"Leigelf is a good man, and I'm not running out on him now."
"Oh, got a bit of an interest in your boss do you?"
"No, not that it's any of your business."
That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times.
This way.
"Come on, hurry up."
Better to stick together down here.
Let's see where this goes.
Good dog.
Stupid dog.
"No going back that way, now."
We'd better push on. The rest of them will have to find another way out.
Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.
I guess we'd better try this way.
Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her?
"I'd rather not tangle with her right now. Let's try to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step."
Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.
Almost there.
Whew. That was close.
"Sneaking is overrated, eh?"
That looks like the way out! I knew we'd make it!
Surely even down in Cyrodiil people have heard news of the war in Skyrim?
"The Nords are tired of spending our blood fighting the Empire's wars, and paying for the Empire's decadence with our taxes."
"Ulfric is our rightful High King. He's leading the fight to drive the Empire out of Skyrim, once and for all."
You haven't heard of the civil war in Skyrim? I guess down in Cyrodiil people have other things to worry about.
"It's pretty simple. Ulfric founded the Stormcloaks years ago, as a sort of private army to advance his ambitions."
He's always used the ban on the worship of Talos to stir people up against the Empire.
"He never succeeded in getting much support, so a few months ago he murdered the High King! That got the Empire's attention."
"I was assigned to Ulfric's guard. We were on our way to Darkwater Crossing, in the south of Eastmarch."
"The Imperials were waiting for us. As pretty an ambush as I ever saw. We were outnumbered five to one, at least."
"Ulfric ordered us to stop fighting. Didn't want us all to die for nothing, I guess."
"I thought they were taking us south to Cyrodiil. Parade us in front of the Emperor. But then we stopped in Helgen, and you know the rest."
"A masterstroke by General Tullius! He's only been in charge here for a few months, but he's turned things around for the Empire."
"We've been trying to catch Ulfric since the war started, but he always seemed to slip through our fingers... like he knew we were coming."
"This time, the General turned the tables on him. Ulfric rode right into our ambush with only a few bodyguards."
"He surrendered pretty meekly, too. So much for his death-or-glory reputation."
"I thought we were taking Ulfric back to Cyrodiil, but I guess the General changed his mind. You know the rest."
"I swear, if I wasn't around, Elgrim would forget to eat his meals. How we make any coin at all is beyond me."
"In fact, I need to arrange for someone to pick up an ore sample for me in Shor's Stone... goodness knows Elgrim won't lift a finger to do it."
"When Elgrim said we were setting up shop down here, I told him he would catch his death."
"The dirt, the moisture... it's disgusting. Who wants to spend their life living like a skeever?"
But that old bellyacher just fed me some nonsense about light ruining his mixtures and being close to the water... agh.
"I know how to mix a few basic potions, but I'm nowhere near as skilled as a master alchemist."
"I've picked up a few tricks by reading the tomes scattered all over the shop, but I don't have the knack to pull half of the formulas off."
"Oh! No, I didn't mean it that way. Elgrim can barely put his on his own shoes let alone have the energy to pursue a young girl."
He's been gushing about how talented Ingun is at alchemy. He'd never say it to her face; that's not his way.
I just think Elgrim's taken it upon himself to mentor the young thing so he focuses a lot of attention on her.
"You would? Oh, that would be wonderful."
Speak to Filnjar in Shor's Stone. He's got some sort of ore sample he wants us to identify and was willing to pay us well for it.
"The job pays well, so I hope I can make arrangements soon. We could really use the gold."
It's about time; I sent them a letter weeks ago. That Elgrim... he'd forget his own pants if his wife didn't help him dress.
Here you go. Tell Hafjorg that she can chip off whatever she thinks is a fair trade for their time.
Redbelly is supposed to be nothing but an iron mine. Been working it for years.
"Then right before the spiders had moved in, we found that chunk of ore. Never seen anything like it."
I want to know what I'm dealing with before I start tearing it out of the ground.
Thank you. I'll be sure to get Elgrim to examine this as soon as his... busy schedule allows.
"Here, I had him make you a few things for all that travel."
"I do. Sadly, I'm one of the few traditional Saxhleel Jewelers that remains in Tamriel; it's becoming a lost art."
Only trouble is gathering materials has become hazardous. The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with bandits... and worse.
Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you.
"Thank you, marsh-friend."
"Thank you, land-strider."
"I'm seeking a small list of items to complete my next creation: two flawless sapphires, a mammoth tusk and a chunk of gold ore."
"Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel call my kind Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel."
"Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel would call us Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel."
"Madesi was actually my original Saxhleel name. Unlike others, I decided to embrace tradition and keep it that way."
"Good, these will make wonderful settings for my rings."
The ivory from this tusk will be perfect for the inlay on my amulets.
Perfect. Melting this down will give me plenty of gold for those necklaces I started.
"No, I think I have enough here to get started."
"Here, let me give you this. It's the least I can do for all your trouble."
And this must be the Hall of Stories.
Oh... I've heard of this. These walls are supposed to show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Too bad we can't read these carvings.  Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
One thing at a time soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're searching for the crown.
"Looks like we weren't the first ones here, either."
"Even if these carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to find a way through this door."
"See what you can figure out auxillary, I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something."
Hmm... what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used for.
Careful! I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
Uh oh! Look out!
Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.
Maybe there's something on the claw itself that could help us.
"Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime."
Mercer was able to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher... the Skeleton Key.
"By doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal and in essence, caused our luck to run dry."
"Well, yes. But the Key isn't only restricted to physical barriers."
"All of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield great power, securely sealed within our minds."
"Once you realize the Key can access these traits, the potential becomes limitless."
"Ah, so they've finally sent someone to deal with that lunatic."
"Well, is it taken care of?"
"Well, that's good to know. I suggest you tell your people at the College to keep a tighter leash on their mages."
I'm afraid so. There's a problem with one of the Jarls here in Skyrim.
He's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in his hold.
She's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in her hold.
"We have, of course, severed all ties with the mage in question, but the Jarl isn't appeased."
"So, the mage needs to be [QUOTE]taken care of,[QUOTE] if you understand me."
"This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm still nervous."
All these damn Stormcloaks. They're making me nervous. Never in a million years did I imagine they'd gain control of Solitude.
"Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even keep the Stormcloaks in line. No way I trust them with the Emperor's life."
"I'm all for diplomacy, but the sooner the Emperor deals with this civil war mess, the sooner we can get back to Cyrodiil."
You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of threat.
"I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name ruined... and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit for duty?"
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he is.
"You misunderstand. It's just... I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me, I'd be a wreck."
"Are you now? You were at Helgen, one of the prisoners. Although no one seems to know how you got mixed up in that affair."
"Normally, I would have welcomed someone like you -- resourceful, clearly no friend of the Empire."
"But I've had some disturbing reports of you... seen talking to General Tullius in Castle Dour, for example."
So what do you have to say for yourself? How can I be sure you're not an Imperial spy?
You... you were at Helgen. One of the prisoners. What makes you think I'm interested in someone like you for the Legion?
You... what? How could you possibly...
"Oh, so you're trying to play both sides, is that it? What do you really want?"
You'd do well to get out of here before I change my mind and have you locked in irons...
Well... you did show remarkable initiative. And you didn't have to bring the crown to me...
But let me warn you - joining the Legion is for life. Any previous loyalties... I trust we understand each other.
"You can prove your new allegiance to me, by delivering an important message to the Jarl of Whiterun."
"So you as good as admit you're working for the Imperials. Yet you walk in here, and ask to join me. What are you playing at?"
The Imperials wouldn't have just let you walk away. Remember that.
"You're not short of guts, are you? What's your game?"
Why would Tullius waste resources getting the crown only to give it to me? Poisoned perhaps? No. He's not that cunning.
Alright. I believe you. You aren't the first to turn away from the Empire in disgust.
"But remember - you're one of us now, forever. Whatever Imperial loyalties you may have had... that's all in the past, forgotten."
"Now, to prove yourself to me, I have a task for you. Take my axe, and deliver it to the Jarl of Whiterun."
"Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting."
"It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look."
Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.
"Dear sister, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting."
"It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look."
Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.
Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.
"Okay, lass. We've got these getups on... now what?"
What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.
No shipments have come in.
"What do I pay you for, to stand around all day? You're supposed to be bringing goods to the store."
There are no goods to bring to the store. That's what I'm saying.
Lazy oaf.
Where are my goods? Did the shipment come in?
Only a few things came today. Cedran said he'd drop it off later.
"Cedran said he'd... what am I paying you for? Next time, you bring the shipment in yourself."
"Careful. You spill one drop of silver, I'm taking it out of your hide."
I'm being as careful as I can.
Did you just talk back to me? I'm not paid to listen. I'm paid to keep you working. Now work.
"Mulush, we need a break. The heat from the smelter is too much."
"Are you complaining? Work. If you have strength to whine, you have strength to smelt."
I could smelt metal in half the time as you weak-willed pink-skins. Do I have to do everything?
No Mulush. I'll work harder.
I don't want any of you thieving workers even thinking about stealing any silver.
"If I see you sneaking off with even one speck of silver, I'll break your leg and throw you into the river."
"Yes, Mulush."
"Careful of the molten metal. That gets on you, kiss your fingers goodbye."
I know what I'm doing. Stop telling me.
"Divines, I'm tired. This is too much work."
"Just keep at it, or Mulush will beat you."
"Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh?"
"I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it."
I remember you... you were with us at Helgen. I heard you joined us. Welcome to the Stormcloaks!
"Ooh... This place really chills the blood, eh?"
"These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say."
"You, too, huh? I'd take a straight fight with the whole Legion over creeping around a place like this."
"But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and nothing's going to stand in our way."
You must be the new recruit. Welcome to the Legion.
At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.
I wish the Legate would let us clear out of here. Place gives me the creeps.
"I don't know what we're doing here, but orders are orders."
I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Stormcloaks in here.
It's the waiting that gets me.
I don't like the look of this place.
Nobody allowed in. Ulfric Stormcloak's orders. Consider yourself warned.
"You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, brother."
"You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, sister."
At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.
I wish Galmar would hurry it up. We shouldn't be here.
I don't know what we're doing here. Ulfric must have his reasons.
I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...
What are we waiting for?
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Imperials in here.
Keep a sharp eye out.
"Don't interfere with Imperial Legion business. Now move along, unless you want three inches of steel in your gut."
"The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish."
"And in return, both in life and in death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher."
"Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose."
"If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me in."
What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?
"Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle."
"By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a business deal."
You'll be provided all of the power and knowledge befitting a Nightingale.
You're free to use those powers as you see fit to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.
"In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and everything within when the need arises."
"More importantly, upon your death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one of its guardians."
"Once the Oath has been struck, the terms are binding."
"Knowing this, are you ready to undergo the ceremony?"
How's the forge today?
It's fine. Much better than the rickety tools I had in the Legion.
Remember that old rusty sword I had? Damn thing must have had over a hundred chips in it.
"Well, if you had learned to swing it correctly. A sword is an extension of the arm, not a meat cleaver."
I was about to say how impressed I was that you always managed to put it back together.
"Flattery doesn't suit you, Thongvor."
"Hello, my friend. Come to visit the forge?"
"I grow tired of counting coin all day. Put steel in my hand, not gold."
"Your family's success burdens you, does it?"
"Sometimes I miss the Legion, back when the Empire stood up for Skyrim."
"No politics, Thongvor. I told you before."
"Good to see you, my friend! I knew you'd make a proper Legionnaire."
I'm glad you'll be with me in there. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
I remember you... You were with us at Helgen... I heard you came around and picked the right side. Welcome to the Legion!
I'm glad you're with us. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
"These old ruins... They don't want us here, the ancient ones. Better left alone."
"But never mind all that. We're the Emperor's soldiers. We'll do our duty no matter what stands in our way, right?"
"You, too, huh? I'd much rather a straight up fight than creeping around a place like this."
"You've come for me, have you?"
You think I don't know what you're up to? You think I can't destroy you?
"The power to unmake the world at my fingertips, and you think you can do anything about it?"
Come then. See what I can do now.
"You're the one with the staff, my boy."
"You're the one with the staff, my dear."
"If it can help us get inside the College, and reach Ancano, we'll have to hope that there's a way to stop all this."
Be on your guard. I've no idea what to expect inside the College.
"Head for the Great Hall, quickly! Don't stop for anything!"
"Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return."
Why are you here? Killing Gaius Maro is but the first step of your contract - you must also plant the incriminating letter on his body...
"Yes, I know. As does Astrid. You have done well, and have earned both your reward, and a bonus, as I may have mentioned."
But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.
It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.
"Yes, I know. As does Astrid. And you've earned your payment, though the bonus is forfeit, as I'm sure you're aware."
But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.
It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.
What should we have tonight?
"Something simple, a stew perhaps."
"Stew again, papa? I want steak."
"Maybe we could spend a little bit more and buy some meat, Endon."
Maybe. Let me think about it.
"Markarth has changed, but the inn is as lively as ever."
"The city hasn't changed that much, dear. Same old dwarven stones gathering the same old moss."
"The stones aren't what bother me, love. The Forsworn are tearing the Reach apart."
Let's not talk about this over dinner.
"Look at you, begging on the streets. Learn a trade."
"Picking on me again, you backbiting Nord? Tired of those prissy nobles turning down your rotten slabs of venison?"
How dare you. No one turns down cut meat from Hogni Red-Arm!
"Hogni Red-Arm, more like Hogni Fat-Arm."
"Alms. Give me some meat, you fat Nord!"
"What did you say to me, Reachman?"
"I said give me some meat. I'm hungry, and the Divines know you don't need more food in that huge gut of yours."
You little twig. I'll snap you in two!
Just try it. Maybe a little time inside Cidhna Mine will get rid of all that fat on you.
Damn him - the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?
I'm glad you're here.
"If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way."
"This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind."
We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.
"So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed."
The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose.
It helped avert attention from our true nature.
"What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing."
"I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?"
"This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business."
This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century.
"It's my hope that you will, yes."
This isn't about religion or destiny. This is nothing more than a business transaction between yourself and Nocturnal.
"Consider this an extremely risky job but with a massive potential for profit, and you'll do fine."
"I call upon you Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow... hear my voice!"
"My Lady, I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure."
"Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels."
We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until your conditions have been met.
I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in life and in death.
"Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild."
"Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild."
"I don't know how you made it this far, but you'll go no farther."
It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.
"Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur."
It's the same dream over and over again. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!
"Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen."
I... I will. Thank you...
"Now, we'll take our friend here back to Hammerfell, where she will pay the price for her treason."
"Not on the way back. Once she gets there, it's not up to me to decide what's done with her."
"And as for you, I owe you a portion of the reward, don't I?"
"Well, here you go. Spend it wisely, and if I may... Don't allow yourself to be fooled by a pretty face. You're better than that."
"Stay your hand, warrior!"
"It's no secret why you're here and you have proven your skill in combat. Let us talk a moment, and no one else needs to die."
I think we can all profit from the situation in which we find ourselves.
"My men will not attack you, if you will lower your weapons."
"Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you."
"Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision."
"Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die."
"We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal."
"Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher."
"Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside."
At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.
I suggest you talk to Karliah first. She has some news that'll turn your stomach.
Time's wasting and Mercer's still out there. Let's get this show on the road.
"This is enough to make your head spin, eh?"
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.
"I'm just as puzzled as you, lad."
"I'm just as puzzled as you, lass."
I think we can trust Karliah. Let's see what she's on about.
I have some preparations of my own to make. I'll meet you at the stone.
"Not now, lad. Karliah said it was important."
"Not now, lass. Karliah said it was important."
We'll speak when the Oath is complete.
You appear ready for the Oath.
You appear hesitant to don your Nightingale Armor. What's troubling you?
"It's just ahead. Please, keep following."
I'm preparing to leave for the standing stone. What is it?
"I promise you, all your questions will be answered. You just have to trust me."
"From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil Sanctum, my path changed its course."
"Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put Gallus's memory to rest."
"I'd always intended Mercer's fate to ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken."
...
Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes me a drink.
It's the rebels! Defend the entrance!
Stormcloaks!
Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim. Give the man my axe.
"If he keeps it, I will bide my time. If he returns it to you, it means war."
Men who understand each other often have no need for words.
There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
Balgruuf will know my meaning.
Men who understand each other often have no need for words.
There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
Hrongar will know my meaning.
Keep your wits about you. The Jarl of Whiterun is known for his temper.
"Get yourself kitted out with what you need. Welcome to the fight, brother!"
"This temple is dedicated to Mara, and the light of love she shines on us all."
"I'm only a humble acolyte, though. If you wish to avail yourself of Mara's blessing, you should speak with Dinya Balu or Maramal."
They should be back shortly. You're welcome to wait here if you like.
"Mind you, it's no business of mine what each Companion does in the name of honor."
"But this sneaking around. It doesn't befit warriors of your standing. Aela knows better, and so should you."
"In any case, I have a task for you."
Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
"Aye, that sounds like him."
"As in all matters of faith, though, the reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you."
"The boy has a nugget of truth, but the reality is more complicated than that."
It always is.
The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred.
"One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven."
"If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power."
"They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else."
But we had been deceived.
"The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies."
We'll get to that.
"It's not so simple as just killing them, though."
"Ah yes, their trickery."
"The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit."
"Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds."
"For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity."
And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.
That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out.
"And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us."
"They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force."
I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in  the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild.
"And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity."
"You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy."
Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive.
"This is not about your desires, lad."
"This is not about your desires, lass."
"I hope it was important, because it means you weren't here to defend him."
One of the fiercest battles I've ever seen.
The Silver Hand. They finally found enough courage to attack Jorrvaskr.
"We fought them off, but..."
The old man... Kodlak... he's dead.
"No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad."
But you and I are going to reclaim them.
We will bring the battle to their chief camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung.
We will avenge Kodlak. And they will know terror before the end.
The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now.
Come up to the Skyforge to pay your respects.
Before the ancient flame...
We grieve.
We grieve.
We grieve.
For the fallen...
Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. It should open the way.
"Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad, still?"
I'll need to prepare them for mounting again.
"Don't get too flowery on me, lad."
"Don't get too flowery on me, lass."
Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here. Trying to evade Hircine.
And so slain the beast inside of me.
"I thank you for this gift. The other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though."
"Perhaps from Sovngarde, the heroes of old can join me in their rescue. The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such triumph."
"And perhaps some day, you'll join us in that battle. But for today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory."
And lead the Companions to further glory.
"Aela's laid claim to your services, and I've learned the hard way not to upset her. Best you stick to her for now."
"Aela said you were hers, and I wasn't supposed to interfere. She scares me."
"And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak's gotten wind of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you."
"My advice? Always be honest with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know."
Where have you been?
"We did well today, Shield-Brother."
"We did well today, Shield-Sister."
"They're mercenaries, only in it for the money. They're led by a man named Kematu. Get rid of him, and the rest will scatter."
"I don't dare show my face, lest they recognize me, so you'll have to find out where they are."
"Please, our tribe suffers and we need help."
"Our Chief, Yamarz, was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed."
"He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home."
"Yamarz refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need."
"No, don't go!"
"No, don't go! You may not be one of our tribe, but you are an Orc nonetheless!"
"We meet at last, my dear lady."
What is this?
What have you done?
"Oh, come now. You didn't really expect to manipulate people forever, did you? Your luck had to run out sometime."
But where will I go? I can't keep running forever!
"After all this, I have to pick up and leave again?"
"If you really think this is the only way, I trust you. Let's not waste any time."
"Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets [QUOTE]punished.[QUOTE]"
Hmph.
"Wait, oh wait. I know you! Yes, yes. From the road! Cicero never forgets a face."
"Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you."
"No time to talk now, my friend. No time. Out mistress needs tending. Keeping."
Why talk? Cicero has nothing to say to you. Call it a matter of... trust.
"Oh, I do wish we could get to know each other better. But not now! I must tend to mother. See her settled."
"I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!"
"And you helped me! You helped poor Cicero! You talked to Loreius, got him to fix my wheel!"
"Oh, you may have pleased me, but you have surely pleased the Night Mother. And our mother, she will never forget."
"I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!"
But you disappeared! You were there... then you weren't! Did you mean to help poor Cicero or not? I'm left to wonder...
"Ah, it doesn't matter. What's done is done, right? Cicero is here! As is the Night Mother! Joy of joys!"
"I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!"
"Oh, but you didn't help poor Cicero! You helped that stupid farmer! Stupid Loreius! Oh, the guard said cruel things about us. Untrue things..."
He said I attacked someone! On the road! But it never happened. Never. Sweet mother and I were just waiting. My knife was sheathed!
He said I was transporting weapons! For the war! In mother's coffin! He made me... open it! Indignity! Sacrilege!
He said I stole something! Me! Poor Cicero. A common thief. The very thought is insulting. One might even say... maddening.
"So polite! So nice! Cicero likes you. The Night Mother is sure to like you too. Oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends."
"Do you mistrust poor Cicero? I am, as you say, just an innocent jester. A fool! Oh, but my work is not foolish, no. For I am our mother's Keeper."
"Oooh... So silent. So menacing. A true assassin of the old way. Cicero likes you. Oh yes, Cicero likes you, indeed."
Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their guts on the ground before they even know we're here.
But do not make the mistake of underestimating the Legion. Plenty of them are Nords same as us.
You hear anything?
"I've found the final resting place of the Jagged Crown. Can you believe it? Well, I'm almost certain."
"We're headed to Korvanjund. But, if old King Borgas is indeed buried there, we're bound to run into trouble of some kind."
Your fellow Stormcloaks are already assembling outside the tomb. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm finished up here.
Get the crown. We will keep an eye out for more of those dustmen.
That crown should be around here somewhere. Just keep an eye out for the bonewalkers...
The Imperials are here in force. Stick together.
"What's the Legion doing here? Damn Imperial spies... Well, should be fun for us, at least. They don't seem to know we're here yet."
Ready to spill some Imperial blood for Skyrim?
You ready?
Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter. Get yourself ready!
That's what I like to hear.
"Alik'r, hold!"
"You've proven your strength, warrior. Let's avoid any more bloodshed."
I think you and I have some things to talk about.
Be careful on the way to Solitude. Damn Stormcloaks could be anywhere.
We'd better keep moving. I feel like that dragon might be up there watching us right now.
"Good luck. If you get a chance, look me up in Solitude."
I'm going to rest up here a while before heading to Windhelm. Be careful.
We'd better keep moving. I don't want to run into any Imperials who know what happened at Helgen.
Good luck. Come to Windhelm and talk to Ulfric. You won't regret it.
"See if you can find some, and I'll try to find some more interesting work by the time you get back."
A citizen of the Reach has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Haafingar has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Hjaalmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Falkreath has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Whiterun has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Pale has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Rift has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Eastmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Winterhold has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Skyrim has been kidnapped.
"The Companions have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this."
Get moving. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late.
"People are rightly stirred up about the damn Thalmor being allowed to roam around arresting people, just for worshipping Talos."
"But was it worth tearing Skyrim apart, and maybe destroying the Empire? No, Ulfric will have a lot to answer for in the end."
"Nords have always supported the Empire, and the Empire has always been good for Skyrim."
I just hope the war doesn't come to Riverwood. There's enough trouble in the world without those Stormcloaks stirring up more.
"So did I! If the damn Stormcloaks somehow found one, or woke it up... the war might be about to take an ugly turn."
"Hard to believe it was just a coincidence, that the first dragon anyone's seen for centuries attacks just as Ulfric was about to be executed."
You didn't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants.
"Right, the leader of the Stormcloaks."
"They claim to be fighting for Skyrim's freedom, but the war is really all about Ulfric wanting to be High King of Skyrim."
"Oh, right, you were caught trying to cross the border into Skyrim, weren't you?"
"You're not kidding. Ulfric's the leader of the Stormcloaks - you know, the traitors trying to break Skyrim away from the Empire."
"I guess that wasn't such a big deal elsewhere in the Empire, but here it's caused a lot of resentment. Native son and all that."
"Even I'll admit it hasn't been the Empire's finest hour. But it wasn't like the Emperor had any choice, did he?"
"If he hadn't signed the peace treaty with the Thalmor, they would have destroyed the Empire - then where would Skyrim be?"
"That's the part that Ulfric's supporters always conveniently forget about. Unless the Empire stands together, the Thalmor will destroy us all."
"It's from that treaty that ended the Great War, remember, when the Emperor was forced by the Thalmor to outlaw Talos worship."
We didn't pay much attention to it when I was a boy - everyone still had their little shrine to Talos.
"But then Ulfric and his [QUOTE]Sons of Skyrim[QUOTE] started agitating about it, and sure enough the Emperor had to crack down."
"Dragging people off in the middle of the night... one of the main causes of this war, if you ask me."
"Name is Stig Salt-Plank, one of the captains of the Blood Horkers."
I've got a top man on the job right now. He should be returning any moment.
I've got a sharp woman on the job right now. She should be returning any moment.
"This must be him, then."
"This must be her, then."
"Hard to say. The weather's taken a bit of a turn, here."
Haldyn's been known to obscure his hideaways with magic.
"If we take care of him, the way should be clear to properly assault the island."
Impressive work. We started the attack once you made the fog scamper away like that.
Hope you didn't catch any of the fire.
We can head back whenever you're set. There's celebrating to be done!
"The Empire may have been good for Skyrim once upon a time, but those days are long past."
"Banning the worship of Talos was the last straw. Thalmor everywhere, dragging people off for honoring our own gods!"
"I'm glad Ralof is helping drive them out of here. If I was a bit younger, I might have joined the fight myself."
"I've got enough to worry about, taking care of my family. I don't concern myself with such matters."
"So you saw a dragon, did you? Tell me, what was it like? As big as a house?"
"Sure, sure. It's just, you know, not every day I meet someone who's laid eyes on a dragon."
Well I'll be! That'd be a sight to see.
"Not that I actually want to see one, understand. I hope that dragon stays far away from here."
Don't even say such things! I hope that dragon stays away from Riverwood. We don't need that kind of trouble.
"What? Oh, hardly! I don't think even Ulfric could pull a dragon out of his pocket."
"Lucky for us it attacked when it did, eh? I wasn't looking forward to getting a shave from the Imperial headsman."
"Seriously, you don't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak himself."
"Right. The leader of our fight against the Empire. I forget that most people don't know what he looks like, except for those Imperial wanted posters."
"Oh, right, they said you were captured crossing the border."
"Still, I'm surprised you haven't heard of Ulfric. He's our leader - the leader of the Stormcloaks."
I don't like this place. It feels like we're being... watched.
"It's a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy."
"If you two cannot handle this, we can find others to hire."
Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue.
This place is unbelievable.
Indeed. Avanchnzel is as much a library as it is a city. Built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer.
Anavchnzel is waiting.
Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?
I told you we should have hired a thief.
"We are thieves, you fool. We're stealing the cube."
And yet none of us can pick a damned lock.
This place is huge.
"It is large, indeed. I did not anticipate Avanchnzel's size or the time needed to uncover the entrance."
Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here.
"Drennen, you do understand that the Lexicon at the bottom of this place holds the accumulated memories of centuries of Dwemer."
So?
"So we're not turning back, you fool."
I thought you said these things were [QUOTE]sleeping[QUOTE]?
You said they were sleeping. I said they were waiting. It seems a few of them were [QUOTE]waiting[QUOTE] for someone to try and take the Lexicon.
Great.
The Lexicon had better be worth all this trouble.
"I assure you, it is. The knowledge contained in the Lexicon created everything you see around you."
You sure that's power we're meant to have?
Absolutely.
Drennen!
Let the field mouse run. Your pay will be double.
My pay will be nothing if we die in here!
"Calm yourself, Breya. We are closing in on the Lexicon. I can feel it calling. We'll continue without Drennen."
We are close now. Can you hear the Lexicon calling out?
"So we grab it and we get out, right?"
"Once we have the Lexicon, we'll need to take it to its podium. I know what to do from there. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be mine."
Ours. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be ours.
We're almost there. I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!
Something doesn't feel right.
Aaaaaaaaaaa....
I have the Lexicon! Where's the podium?
I can't hold these things! We need to leave!
I did not come all the way here just to walk out empty-handed.
"The way out is right there! Run, damn it!"
"Yes, Yes. It is an ancient and ruined city. Built by the Dwemer. The dwarf folk. It is nearby, but I'd stay clear. People say it is quite dangerous."
You think I'd be in hiding if this was something I trusted town guards to handle?
"These men are ruthless. Cunning, deceitful... they'll pay off whoever they can. I can't trust anyone here in Whiterun."
"Guards and Jarls can be bought. And the Alik'r are close; I'm running out of time, so I'm choosing to trust you."
I don't know for sure. I spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion publicly; I suspect that's why these men were hired to hunt me down.
"Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him."
The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.
"Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble."
"Hey, I'm not done talking to you yet. Come back here!"
Let me put it to you this way.
Nothing happens in Riften without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend the rest of the fourth era in prison.
I've already said too much.
"I gave you what you came here for, now go. Leave me in peace."
Give it your best shot!
No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for!
That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.
Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine.
That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.
Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve quite a bit of gold for her people.
"Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad."
Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.
"Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lass."
Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.
Changed your mind? You ready to pledge your blood and honor for Skyrim's freedom?
"Never said that. Just that we don't get many of you wanting to join, that's all."
"Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know."
"If you really are Ralof's friend, I'll be glad to help you. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?"
"My sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure she'd help you out."
It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.
"You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today."
"If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric."
So you are alive. I was starting to wonder.
Look for a way out! We are not going to burn to death in our own damned Sanctuary!
Come on! We've got to find a way out of here!
All I can tell you for now is that he's abused his authority as a Nightingale.
"As a Nightingale, I took an oath and was sworn to secrecy."
Be patient and your time will come.
I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable.
"Without two keys, it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies."
"Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of material he could on locations the Guild could heist."
"Museums, keeps, estates... you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we must have had a few dozen."
"Look, before I have you help track Mercer down I need to know what you learned from Karliah. I mean everything."
"Aye. I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the Guild."
Anything else?
"What? Nightingales? But, I always assumed they were just a tale... a way to keep the young footpads in line."
Was there anything else she told you?
"Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass."
Was there anything else?
"Look, you've already been told you're not allowed here. Turn around and go back the way you came."
We're causing no trouble. All we ask is to look for her.
"I don't care what you're doing, after what happened you're lucky I don't toss you in jail. Now get lost."
We will be back. This is not over.
"The College of Winterhold is an amazing sight. I've never set foot on the grounds, but always wanted to."
The Forsworn haven't been kind to Karthwasten. I've heard rumors that they've attacked this place without mercy.
"I grew up in The Pale. This land was my home for most of my life... and for a Dunmer, that's quite a statement, I assure you."
We should bow our heads in silent reverence for those who are interred in Falkreath's cemetery.
I've always wanted to make a pilgrimage here to the Temple of Mara. Thank you for bringing me here... you've made me quite happy.
"Watch your step, Markarth has quite a reputation thanks to the Silver-Blood family. I wouldn't advise crossing them."
"What an amazing city. I've actually never managed to visit Whiterun, but I always wanted to."
Windhelm is absolutely freezing. How can these people tolerate it?
I was a student at the Bards College for a short time... until my affiliation with Vaermina was discovered. I haven't been back to Solitude since.
I've heard Riften's home to the worst Skyrim has to offer. I hope we don't run into any trouble while we're here.
"Her Benevolence has taught me patience and mercy, but these vampires deserve none of it."
A good friend of mine was infected by a vampire long ago. He killed himself rather than change into one of those... things.
Vampires are utter abominations. We need to do everything in our power to destroy them.
Being a priest of Vaermina put me very close to dark sorcery at its worst.
"Let's try and stay together, the sorcerers in these places tend to... well, harvest bodies for parts."
"I've seen my share of black magic, but that's all in the past now."
This place must be cleansed. These draugr were once living beings and they deserve better.
These poor souls... suffering in eternal servitude.
The thought of the dead rising... makes me sick to my stomach.
Bandits know nothing of pity or mercy. No need to show them any either.
"A group of bandits descended on Dawnstar once... if it wasn't for the guard, who knows what they could have done to the place."
Bandits are the worst lot. They'd steal from their own mothers given the chance.
I thought I heard footsteps. Be careful.
"When I was a young acolyte of Vaermina, I paid my dues in a shrine located within the catacombs of a fort in Cyrodiil."
I served as a healer in a fort not unlike this one long ago.
I can't imagine what happened to the dwarves. How could a race with the capability to build a place like this simply vanish?
I've never been inside a dwarven ruin. They are simply astounding.
"Did you hear that? A metal on stone sound... hmmm, perhaps it was nothing."
This place could be massive... very easy to get lost. We have to be careful not to lose our way.
What a marvel of engineering. The ancient Nords were ingenious builders.
"Ugh, this place... horrible."
"Watch yourself, these Nordic ruins are notorious for their traps."
"These ruins are old, maybe a thousand years or more."
Why anything would chose to reside down here is beyond me.
"These caves... they harbor ill omens, I can sense it."
Trust in Mara... she'll protect us in this dark place.
I don't like the looks of this place... not at all.
"I don't know what persuaded you to assist me when we met in Dawnstar, but I'm glad you did."
"I've done a lot of... questionable things in my life. Serving Vaermina was a horrible mistake, and I hope Mara will forgive me one day."
I was recruited as an acolyte of Vaermina as a young elf. I had no real childhood to speak of... we weren't permitted to socialize.
I've always felt a great deal of guilt running from Nightcaller Temple and leaving my friends to die. I'll never forgive myself for that.
"After running from Nightcaller Temple, I wandered Skyrim for years until I was taken in by a priest of Mara who lived in Morthal."
Finding Mara was the greatest moment of my life. I'll never forget the warmth that spread through my heart when we embraced.
"It was a bit difficult to come to the ways of Mara at first, but my fellow priests were kind and quite patient with me."
"I've never admitted this before, but I've killed more than I care to admit. I'll just leave it at that."
"My parents are long dead, but they lived wonderful lives... I have no sad stories to tell about them. Perhaps one day I'll visit their resting place."
"I've been enjoying this journey with you. Not for the wealth we've accumulated, but just being carry Mara's will to every corner of Skyrim."
"It's wonderful to be able to sleep soundly, don't you think?"
"The Greybeards are an amazing lot. Imagine, living your entire life without speaking to a friend or a loved one. I couldn't stand it."
"I've been to Ivarstead a few times, but never climbed High Hrothgar. I wouldn't mind visiting the monastery at the summit."
"When the weather permitted, Aerin and I would often walk the Rift's forests. The trees here are so beautiful."
"Ah, Winterhold. I've always wanted to visit this place. The secrets locked inside must be astounding."
Incredible... imagine the manpower and ingenuity needed to carve the buildings of Markarth.
Whiterun is a such beautiful city. Have you ever seen the likes of this place?
This is the first time I've set foot in Windhelm. What a dreary place.
"My mother always loved the sea. When I was young, we'd visit Solitude and watch the ships from the bluff. Ah... better times."
It feels good to walk the streets of Riften again.
Vampires... an unclean lot. It will be a pleasure to clear this place.
Don't let the vampires strike you or else you may get infected with their blood poisoning.
Be aware of rune traps on the ground or else this could be a very short expedition.
"Kill these casters as fast as you can, otherwise they may summon creatures we don't want to deal with."
Ugh... dark sorcery. Always makes my skin crawl.
"If there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that draugr burn like tinder. We could use that to our advantage."
Many have fallen in this crypt. The Draugr show no mercy.
"Ugh, Draugr. They reek of decay."
"When I was a child, my village was burned to the ground by bandits. Do you know I actually saw one laugh as he ran my brother through..."
I hope there's more bandits around... their numbers could use a little more thinning.
These bandits would stab each other in the back if it meant an extra coin in their pockets.
Bandits... the worst type of scum.
Perhaps we can find some treasure if we search the grounds of the fort thoroughly.
If fought more than my share of bandits in places like this.
Keep your eyes open for ambushes. These forts have too many blind corners.
"These are the most dangerous, but the most profitable types of ruins. The dwarves must have been a prosperous race."
Watch the walls for the sphere constructs... they can appear in the blink of an eye.
The dwarves were masters at subterranean construction... these ruins show  only a fraction of their capabilities.
Mzinchaleft. I swore I'd never return here.
I almost died in a ruin just like this.
"Danger's about, I can tell. Be cautious."
Can you just imagine how ancient this place must be? Hundreds of years? Thousands?
"There could be Draugr about, I can smell the decay in the air."
I've ventured into quite a few Nord ruins in my day.
Killed my first creature in a cave just like this... I'll never forget it.
I'm certain we'll find some treasure down here.
"Keep your eyes open, I don't like the looks of this place."
Exploring these caves feels like coming home. I missed this.
I've really missed traveling like this. Walking the breadth of Skyrim has always filled my heart with excitement.
I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.
You should have seen me at the height of my adventuring career... I was fearless and took too many risks. But that's what it was all about.
"I remember a cutpurse trying to rob me on the road once. When I drew Grimsever, I think the poor man soiled his armor!"
"I've seen enough death to last three lifetimes, yet I never tire of a good fight. What do you make of that?"
"When I was young, I'd journey with my father on hunting expeditions into Morrowind. The cliff racers made for excellent sport."
"I love the cold air... it's exhilarating. Perhaps it's because of my Nord blood, but there's something about it that makes me feel alive."
"My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps as a hunter, but I set my aspirations a bit higher. He never complained... I miss him."
My mother was a strong woman... she's the one who instructed me on my swordfighting techniques. Can you imagine?
People say Skyrim is one of the most dangerous places in Tamriel. I think they're wrong... it's magnificent and I'm proud to call it home.
"As we walk these stone passages, we delve into the very bones of the earth."
There is an unnatural chill in the air. Some evil power is at work in this place.
"I do not envy those creatures that make a home in such cold, dark places as this."
Careful. Our footsteps will echo in every chamber and tunnel.
"By the Nine, I'd pay good money for a pint of ale to warm my bones!"
Curse this chill! I should have dressed more warmly.
"If this cold numbs my fingers any worse, I'll scarcely be able to hold a weapon."
"Gods, I'd hate to lose my footing in a place like this. A fall on this stony floor will break bones."
Take extra care you don't hit your head on a low-hanging bit of stone.
Mind your step. I think I spied a patch of ice on the floor.
"Don't go stopping for a nap. If you fall asleep in this place, you'll never wake up."
Are you sure you can find your way? It would be easy to get lost in here.
This cold is unbearable. It's all I can do not to shiver until my teeth rattle.
Would it be foolish to stop for a while and light a fire? I suppose it would.
"Gods willing, we'll find a chest full of gold in one of these chambers."
"At times like this, I truly appreciate the joys of a warm fire and a stiff drink."
There are strange echoes in these caves. Keep you eyes open.
"If a man can't feel at home in a freezing cave, then he isn't truly a Nord."
"I have to admit, I admire your courage. Most folk in Skyrim wouldn't go near a place like this."
"When I was a boy, my friends and I used to play [QUOTE]seek the wumpus[QUOTE] in caves much like this."
Caves sounded more exciting in the bard's songs.
It's kind of dark in here.
How deep is this cave?
It feels like a whole mountain of rock is above  us.
"In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford."
I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.
These earthen passages do not agree with me. I already miss the wind and sky.
"The fewer of these mines we venture into, the happier I'll be."
The cloying air in this place is almost unbearable.
"By the gods, let this mine be small so we can be done with it quickly."
"My nose and mouth are so full of dust, I can hardly breath."
Wouldn't it be something if we found a vein of gold?
It would be easy for someone -- or something -- to sneak up on us down here.
"Are you sure you wouldn't rather explore, say, a nice tavern?"
Let's try not to make too much noise. I've heard that cave-ins can start that way.
I wonder what they were mining down here.
"Let's hope the miners didn't unearth anything besides precious stones, if you take my meaning."
Not for all the gold in Skyrim would I spend my life working in these tunnels.
I've heard that miners sometimes die from poisonous gases trapped beneath the ground.
I'm already looking forward to getting back above ground.
You know what I miss the most right now? Fresh air.
"It takes uncommon strength to work the mines in Skyrim. The earth here is cold and hard, like the heart of a Nord."
There's an old maid's tale that says our ancestors dug these mines with their bare hands.
I've half a mind to grab a pickaxe and start digging. Never know what you might find.
It seems warmer down here than it was outside.
Hard to believe people actually have to work in places like this.
Wonder what they mine from these walls.
I'll take a sword or mace over a pick axe any day.
Do you think we'll find gold nuggets in here?
It is strange to think that these chambers were once home to the ancient Nords.
I feel the eyes of angry spirits upon us. We are not welcome here.
"Few would dare to trespass in these ruins. What you lack in wisdom, you make up for in courage."
Do not ask me to take treasures from this place. I will not risk the anger of the dead.
"They say ruins like these are filled with treasure. Of course, they're filled with traps, too."
I could have sworn I heard something right behind us.
I'll bet some of these artifacts would fetch a good price. I hope they're not cursed.
"I wonder what the ancient Nords did in these ruins. Unspeakable sacrifices, maybe?"
"If these ruins frighten you, take comfort in the knowledge that I am here."
"Do try not to set off any traps, will you?"
I suppose you intend to carry off every item of value in these ruins.
These ruins might be interesting if I wasn't already an expert on Nordic history.
Remember to check behind you every once in a while. Who knows what might try to sneak up on us.
Keep your eyes open for traps. Old ruins like this are usually filled with them.
"The ancient Nords were a savage people, but they built some remarkable crypts and temples."
There's a lot of history in a place like that. I'll bet these walls could tell some amazing stories.
"Look at this craftsmanship! These old halls fill some folk with dread, but as a Nord, they fill me with pride."
"We're bound to find some gold in these ruins, but out of respect, let's leave a few coins for the dead."
It's strange to think that some of my own ancestors might be buried in here.
"Plunder these ruins at your peril, friend. The spirits of the dead won't look kindly upon it."
Never knew a place could be so ancient. I bet it's over a thousand years old.
Wonder if any of my ancestors ever walked these halls?
"Everything in here seems to be about death. Burial urns, crypts, funeral shrouds. It's a bit depressing."
I wonder what the ancient nords used this place for?
"The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans."
There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.
It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.
There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.
What good is a sword or an axe against an enemy made of brass and steel?
"It's unnatural, building all these machines. If you ask me, the Dwemer got what they deserved."
I don't like fighting these Dwemer creations. Where's the fun in killing something that doesn't even bleed?
Watch out for the hot steam vents down here. They'll burn you worse than fire.
"Had they placed their faith in magic instead of machinery, the Dwemer might still be around."
"A living Dwemer was once discovered in Morrowind. Can you imagine it, being the last surviving member of your race?"
I should bring some of these Dwemer artifacts to the Arcane University in Cyrodiil for study.
I wonder what keeps these machines working so long after their masters disappeared.
"The Dwemer created so many wondrous machines, and yet nobody ever followed in their footsteps. Why is that, I wonder?"
"Among other things, the Dwemer were expert trap-makers. Watch the floor for tripwires and false plates."
I've half a mind to dismantle one of these Dwemer machines. I'd like to see how it works.
I suppose the warmth in this place comes from all the hot steam vents.
Scholars say the Dwemer were an advanced culture. Ha! The Nords outlasted their entire race. So much for being advanced.
I wonder why the Dwemer came to Skyrim. Why did they build this place? I suppose we'll never know.
Do these steel walls and strange Dwemer devices make you uneasy? Perhaps it's just me.
"I've heard that you can sell Dwemer artifacts on the black market down in Cyrodiil. They fetch a handsome price, too."
This place is amazing! It's hard to believe that mortal hands built them.
What do you think these devices were for?
The stories don't say why the dwarves disappeared. I wonder if their machines turned on them.
It's amazing this place is so well preserved. There isn't even a hint of rust.
So many shadowy corners to strike from! I could learn to like this place.
Silence will serve us well in this place. Let us take our foes by surprise.
"Be wary for traps. If you spy one, try to get an enemy to trigger it."
I can see the battle-lust in your eyes. Doom will surely come to any who cross your path.
"If it wasn't for all the dangers in here, this place could almost be cozy."
"When I was a child, I dreamed about having a fort like this all to myself."
"I wonder if we'll come across some bandits who've just finished roasting a rabbit on a spit. Maybe they'll have a keg of ale, too."
"If my ma could see me now, she'd scold me good. She'd tell me I should know better than to go poking around in abandoned forts."
This smell of dank earth and worm-eaten wood is going to make me lose my last meal.
"How pathetic, being forced to eke out a miserable existence in a place like this."
Just look at this place. Is this what passes for a fort in Skyrim?
"The sooner we can get out of this filth-pit, the better."
These timber supports are rotted through. It's a wonder this place is still standing.
"Check every crate, chest and barrel you see. Who knows, maybe a few of them have something valuable inside."
Did you bring a torch? These old forts can get pretty dark inside.
There are forts like this all over Skyrim. The Imperials abandoned most of them a long time ago.
Just look at this place. I've seen better workmanship from Nord children only ten winters old.
"So this is what passes for Imperial craftsmanship. Try not to sneeze, or you might bring the whole fort down."
"What is that stench? Rotting wood, perhaps? That can't be good."
You'd have to be pretty desperate to want to make a home in this dank hole.
The Jarls never want to pay to keep the forts. They just keep slipping further into ruin.
I wonder what great battles were fought here?
Do you think Tiber Septim ever fought here?
I can see why they built the fort here. A small force could control most of the nearby land.
Outlaws and brigands are the lowest of the low. They prey on their own countrymen for profit.
"I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse."
"The Forsworn are as wild as wolves. Practice those old magics, so some folk say."
Wizards. Why is it always wizards.
"It isn't just your blood that a vampire wants, it's your mortal soul."
Fighting draugr is as much about controlling your fear as anything else.
Most bandits are cowards. These seem to be braver than most.
These wizards are mad beyond reason. They understand only violence.
There is no greater madness than those who seek to become vampires. That's a dark bargain if there ever was one.
You can easily break a blade on the metal skin of a Dwemer construct.
I hate bandits and thieves. Men like these raid our town every year.
"I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse."
"The Forsworn are strange men. They fight to reclaim Markarth, but they live like savages."
I don't like wizards and their spells. Give me an axe any day.
These walking devices are strange yet amazing. What magic powers them?
I'd rather fight bandits than draugr. At least bandits know when to stay dead.
"Taken alone, the draugr aren't so fearsome. They're far more deadly in greater numbers."
These Forsworn are just savages. They live in caves and ruins when civilized folk build towns and cities.
You can't argue with these mages. They'll attack you on sight.
It probably took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build one of those things.
There may be no enemy more foul than a walking corpse.
I thought about becoming a bandit. I decided I preferred clean clothes and fresh mead.
These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.
"It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic."
There is no adversary more deadly than a vampire. They are as cruel as they are cunning.
"Bandits are desperate men. They have nothing to lose, and they fight like it."
"What some call devotion to the dark arts, I call foolishness."
These Forsworn don't even have the decency to dress right.
Draugr are slow and clumsy. Hardly a challenge for a man like me.
I would find the Dwemers' mechanical guardians fascinating if they didn't try to kill everything on sight.
Don't get too far ahead.
"Pleased enough, I suppose. At least they appreciate the ways and traditions of the Nord people."
Can't say I ever much liked the idea of the Empire telling us what to do an' how to do it.
Of course they have! I've made no secret of my loyalty to the Empire. I'm no coward.
"Twice I've been robbed, and good luck getting any kind of justice from Vignar now that he's the Jarl. He probably told the Stormcloaks to do it."
"Lately, they've been threatening to send my whole family into exile if we're caught collaborating with the Empire. They think we're spies!"
"Needless to say, these rebels and I have no love for each other."
"I'm sure my brother Vignar is, since they made him Jarl after throwing Balgruuf out."
"Comes the end of the day, Imperials and Stormcloaks ain't much different."
Both sides want to tell you how you should live your life. Guess I'd rather hear it from a real Nord than some Emperor down south.
"With open arms, with cheers and song, with joy in my heart and tears in my eyes!"
"Praise be to Talos, this is a glorious day for Whiterun and for all Skyrim! Our liberators have come at last!"
"If the gods are merciful, they've found a safe place to hide in the city."
"I hope Vignar doesn't find them. He'll ask a king's ransom, I'm sure."
"If it's the war you're referring to, I'm on the side of Whiterun."
"No doubt General Tullius and his friends in the Empire will tell you that I owe them my loyalty, and perhaps I do."
Ulfric Stormcloak would say that I owe my allegiance to the Nord people as they fight for Skyrim's independence. Perhaps this is also true.
The day might come when I am forced to draw my sword for one side or the other.
But that day has not come yet.
No doubt he thought it was the only way to make his point. And also because he knew he could.
"The gold, the jewels... it's all gone."
That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!
Vex! Put it away... right now.
We can't afford to lose our heads... we need to calm down and focus.
"Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away."
Are you all right? What happened in there?
By the Nine...
"Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead?"
There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe.
"Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a stop to this!"
I can hardly believe it.
But there's no time. Whatever happened here has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make sure everything's all right.
"I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!"
He's my son. I just... I feel it in my heart. You'd understand if you had children.
You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.
"Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all been misled!"
"No tricks, Karliah or I'll cut you down where you stand."
Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?
I have Gallus's journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.
"No, it... it can't be."
This can't be true. I've known Mercer too long...
"There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault."
"It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses."
"Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn."
What's in that book? What did it say?
It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was looking into it before he was murdered.
That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.
He didn't need to pick the lock.
What's she on about?
"Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth."
"I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours."
"By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!"
I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to suspect who I am.
Are you ready to face the Guild?
Are you finished your other business and ready to face the Guild?
Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to expect when we enter the cistern.
Then we show them Gallus's journal and hope for the best.
"Remember, we have proof and all he's got is his word."
"Time is of the essence here, please hurry back."
"It's hardly a secret that they have ties to the Empire, and hate anyone who speaks out against it."
"Thorald did worse. He took action against the Empire, and the Battle-Borns knew it."
The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun.
"Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind."
"They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back."
Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.
"Bloody enough for you, outsider?"
Markarth. Is it bloody enough for you?
"Then turn around and go back where you came. City doesn't need you, doesn't want you."
Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. That's the way it is. That's the way it'll stay.
"Then you've found your home, friend. Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. Welcome."
"If I was threatening you, believe me, you'd know it."
"You outsiders never learn. If the Forsworn don't get you, the guards will throw you in Cidhna Mine to work your fingers off."
"Think that's water in the river? Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth, friend."
No. I live in a nice house in Solitude where the air isn't filled with smoke from the silver smelters and golden-haired girls shine my shield.
Been here ever since I left the Bards College. Turns out a few muscles earn more gold than a damn lute.
"The Silver-Bloods pay me, let me crack a few skulls, and keep the guards off my back. That's all I need."
Jarl is who you want to talk to. Always coin to be made killing off some Forsworn in the hills.
As long as you don't mind going axe-to-axe with a bunch of Daedra-worshipping savages who practice the dark arts.
It's right there in the name of the most powerful family in Markarth. The Silver-Bloods.
"They have a whole mine filled with prisoners to dig up silver ore, gets smelted by workers they pay, and they own half the city."
"I work for them. The inn is named after them. When the guards make an arrest, they check with them first."
"Why are you bothering me, kinsman?"
"Why are you bothering me, outsider?"
Then you're talking to the wrong man. You want that elf in the keep. Calcelmo.
The only thing I'll tell you about Markarth is stay out of our business. We have enough around here without some outsider causing trouble.
"I don't. Go bother Kleppr at the Silver-Blood Inn, he handles the newcomers."
"And by Ysmir, if you find work, just do what you're told. There's enough trouble in Markarth already."
That's about the only harmless thing you can do in this city. Silver-Blood Inn is the place to go.
"And once you've had your fill of mead, do us all a favor and go home. Markarth has enough trouble."
Grew up in a stronghold. Every Orc girl tended the forge at some point.
"But a girl has to grow up, and life in the stronghold asked for a lot in return, so I joined the Legion. Mastered my trade there."
That's right. An Orc stronghold. Kept to ourselves. Lived as our ancestors would have wanted.
"Wasn't enough for me, though. I left. Didn't want to end up as the third wife of some lowly chieftain."
You strike your metal like a new mother giving her babe a light slap. Hit it harder.
"I'm sorry, Ghorza. I just... flinch, and uh...."
"If you can't pound the dusk out of your iron, it'll break when it's finished. Hit. It. Harder."
"What am I supposed to do? Never leave the house? You want that, Endon?"
"You're closing the stall, and that's final."
You want to give up now? Out of fear? Is that what we're teaching our daughter?
"Mama, why are you and papa fighting?"
We're not fighting we're just.... Why don't I get you something to eat? Mama and papa will talk later.
Think we should buy more horses next season?
"I'd rather spend the gold on a new litter of pups, but the horses bring in more gold."
How are the new breeds getting along with my dogs?
Haven't attacked each other yet. Good a sign as any.
"Sure, what can I do for you?"
"Sure, what can I do for you?"
For a generous fellow traveler? But of course. What would you like to hear?
"Sorry friend, but it looks like you're a bit light in the purse, and the wayward minstrel can't afford to do free performances."
"Sure, my voice could use a rest."
"Well all right, then."
Would you now?
"Well, spit it out. What's the matter?"
Bah! Stop wasting my time!
What about him?
Did he now?
Nobody pilfers property on my watch.
"My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
What?
How dare that little fool! And right under my nose!
"My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
What?
"An assault. On my watch. By the gods, he'll not get away with this."
"My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
"Ha ha! Oh, I knew I had a good feeling about you!"
"Here, my friend. A few septims, to show my thanks, hmm? And may that twisted little jester rot in a cell for a fortnight!"
"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as mortal, but as dovah!"
"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as elf, but as dovah!"
"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as orc, but as dovah!"
"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as khajiit, but as dovah!"
"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as Argonian, but as dovah!"
"Come, Dovahkiin. Nin Yol. Strike me with the fire of your Thu'um."
Why do you delay? Are you Dovahkiin or not?
Do not be afraid. Faasnu. Let me feel the power of your Thu'um.
Aaah... yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind.
"By long tradition, the elder speaks first."
"Do you know why I live here, at the peak of the Monahven - what you name Throat of the World?"
You have not answered my question. Why do you need to learn this Thu'um?
Ah. I have expected you. Prodah.
You would not come all this way for tinvaak with an old dovah. No. You seek your weapon against Alduin.
"Nid. If you wish me to answer your question, you must answer mine."
"Yes. Alduin... zeymah. The elder brother. Gifted, grasping and troublesome as is so often the case with firstborn."
But why? Why must you stop Alduin?
"True... But qostiid - prophecy - tells what may be, not what should be."
"Qostiid sahlo aak. Just because you can do a thing, does not always mean you should."
Do you have no better reason for acting than destiny? Are you nothing but a plaything of dez... of fate?
"Pruzah. As good a reason as any. There are many who feel as you do, although not all."
"Some would say that all things must end, so that the next can come to pass."
Perhaps this world is simply the Egg of the next kalpa? Lein vokiin? Would you stop the next world from being born?
"Hahaha! You have much to learn of the dov, then."
"There is nothing else but philosophy to a dovah. It is no accident that we do battle with our Thu'um, our Voices."
There is no distinction between debate and combat to a dragon. Tinvaak los grah. For us it is one and the same.
Paaz. A fair answer.
Ro fus... maybe you only balance the forces that work to quicken the end of this world.
Even we who ride the currents of Time cannot see past Time's end. Wuldsetiid los tahrodiis.
"Those who try to hasten the end, may delay it. Those who work to delay the end, may bring it closer."
"If you can see your destiny clearly, your sight is clearer than mine."
"Dahmaan - remember, Alduin also follows his destiny, as he sees it."
"But, I bow before your certainty. In a way I envy you. The curse of much knowledge is often indecision."
"And so, perhaps, your destiny will be fulfilled. Who can say?"
"Dez motmahus. Even to the dov, who ride the currents of Time, destiny is elusive."
"Alduin believes that he will prevail, with good reason. Rok mul."
"And he is no fool. Ni mey, rinik gut nol. Far from it. He began as the wisest and most far-seeing of us all."
"Drem. All in good time. First, a question for you. Why do you want to learn this Thu'um?"
But you have indulged my weakness for speech long enough. Krosis. Now I will answer your question.
We don't just take in any milk drinker who stumbles in. Talk to Kodlak if you think you have what it takes to be a Companion.
"I don't know if you're capable, and I don't have time to find out. If Kodlak will vouch for you, I might have some work you could do."
Kodlak is the one who figures out who can be a Companion. So talk to him. It's out of my hands.
"So you think you have what it takes? Huh. Lucky for you, I'm not the one who makes that decision. Talk to Kodlak."
"Who knows, maybe he's in a generous mood."
Aren't you already running a job for Aela? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
Aren't you already running a job for Farkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
Aren't you already running a job for Vilkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
Aren't you already running a job for Skjor? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
I sell my catch across a good portion of Skyrim... it's worth its weight in gold to me.
"The only untapped market left is Markarth. However, I just got word that Kleppr at The Silver Blood Inn might be interested."
"If you're headed that way, I would appreciate you delivering a purchase agreement for me. You'd be paid, of course."
Good. Kleppr will pay you as soon as you arrive with the letter. Here you are.
Certainly.
"Ah, Bolli finally got someone out here. Well it's about time. I've been waiting for weeks."
"Well, thank you for bringing it I suppose. Have a good day."
"What? Oh! How could I have possibly forgotten. Your reward, of course... of course."
Here you are. So sorry about that.
"If you must know, I was practicing in the yard when the guard I was sparring with feinted when I specifically told him to duck!"
My blade bit right into the stonework next to the keep and needed serious repairs. Thankfully our smith Balimund works wonders.
"In fact, if you'd fetch my blade from him I'd be most appreciative."
Thank you. Do hurry please.
Hmph. I should have known better than to ask a knave.
Took your sweet time getting it to me.
"Here you go, for your trouble."
"Lazy good-for-nothing, isn't he? Sent you down here when I'm a stone's throw from the keep?"
Here's the sword. Tell Harrald to stop slaying walls and perhaps his blade will stay in better condition!
"Agh! Bother and befuddle! Stuck here! Stuck! My mother, my poor mother. Unmoving. At rest, but too still!"
The farmer is at his farm! Where else would he be? Loreius is his name. Talk to him. Convince him to help poor Cicero.
Poor mother... she's been waiting here so long... Stupid farmer and his stupid tools! Why won't he help us?
Poor mother... Her new home seems so very far...
"Unfair! Unjust! Cicero has done nothing wrong! Loreius will pay for his treachery! Oh, how he will pay... And you! You were no help! Not at all!"
"I will wait for Loreius! Oh yes, mother and I will wait right here, right here until he fixes our wheel."
"Oh, for the love of Mara. What now?"
You need to report that crazy jester to the guard. He should be patrolling the road.
I thought we'd talked enough. Unless you've reconsidered my offer? That Cicero needs sortin'...
Well? Is it done? Have you reported the fool to the guard?
"Ha! That'll teach the little jester to go bothering the decent, hardworking folk of Skyrim. Fool never should have come here."
"Little fool's going to experience the hard reality of Skyrim justice, eh?"
"You can tell Cicero I'll be along presently. I just need to do a couple things here first, and gather my tools."
"Just need to gather my tools and finish up a couple of things. No worries - I'll see to Cicero, make sure that wagon gets fixed."
You need something?
"You don't want to go up to that farmhouse, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife, slaughtered in the night. So many knife wounds..."
"Don't worry, citizen. I'm on top of that little matter we discussed."
"I'll soon arrange transportation for our little friend. Don't worry, he'll rot in a cell and pay for what he's done."
"You need something talk to my husband. Vantus Loreius. Or just Loreius, if it's all the same to you."
That Cicero feller?
Hmph. Tell me something I don't know. Crazy fool's already asked me about five times. Seems he's not satisfied with my answer.
Why can't he just leave us alone?
"Is something wrong. [QUOTE]Is something wrong?[QUOTE] she asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!"
"Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?"
Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?
"Is something wrong. [QUOTE]Is something wrong?[QUOTE] he asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!"
"Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?"
Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?
Pay me? You think this is about money?
"Have you seen the man? He's completely out of his head. A jester? Here, in Skyrim? Ain't been a merryman in these parts for a hundred years."
"And he's transporting some giant box. Says it's a coffin, and he's going to bury his mother. Mother my eye."
He could have anything in there. War contraband. Weapons. Skooma. Ain't no way I'm getting involved in any of that.
"Well, there is something. There's a guard, patrols the road that crazy jester is on. He passes by pretty often."
"You could report the fool. You know, say he's done something against the law. That will at least get rid of him for me. What do you say?"
What?
"And just who in Mara's name are you, anyway? Hmm? Come here, telling me my business. And for what? To help a... a... a fool!"
"Hmph. Fine. Suit yourself. But you're wrong, anyway. Just look at the fool. I don't know what it is, but he's damn well guilty of something."
Ha! Wonderful!
"Like I said, the guard is down by the road. You really can't miss him."
"You tell him that jester is up to no good, and he'll deal with it. Then come back here, and I'll toss a few coins your way, yeah?"
"Poor Cicero is stuck. Can't you see? I was transporting my dear, sweet mother. Well, not her. Her corpse! She's quite dead."
I'm taking mother to a new home. A new crypt. But... aggh! Wagon wheel! Damnedest wagon wheel! It broke! Don't you see?
"Oh. Oh yes! Yes, the kindly stranger can certainly help!"
"Go to the farm - the Loreius Farm. Just over there, off the road. Talk to Loreius. He has tools! He can help me! But he won't! He refuses!"
"Convince Loreius to fix my wheel! Do that, and poor Cicero will reward you. With coin! Gleamy, shiny coin!"
You... you did? He has?
Oh stranger! You have made Cicero so happy! So jubilant and ecstatic! But more! Even more! My mother thanks you!
"Here, here. For your troubles! Shiny, clinky gold! A few coins for a kind deed! And thank you! Thank you again."
"Have you met my husband? Well don't bother, he's a drunk."
"He promised me, swore on his ancestors, that he'd give up the mead. And what do I find out? He's been stashing drink in a cave nearby."
"He even has some wolves guarding it. I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it."
"If you want to try, but I'll keep my dagger sharpened just in case."
"You can help yourself to any drink you find, but bring me the bottle of Dragon's Breath Mead. It's his favorite, so I know he has one there."
"It's not luck, it's mead I'm cursing."
"Stendarr's Mercy to you. If my Horgeir doesn't give up the mead this time, I'll hit him over the head with it."
"Here, for your trouble."
"Shor's Crown, that woman never gives up. I guess that's why I married her."
"You're a real friend saving this mead from her. Here, let me show you how to block a punch that might be coming from some angry spouse, huh?"
"We'd be better off without the Silver-Bloods. They send their brute, Yngvar, to shake some coins from me every few days."
And Betrid Silver-Blood is always asking for more potions to fuel Thonar's [QUOTE]ambitions.[QUOTE] Gives him a temper fiercer than any bear.
"When I heard Cicero screaming, I knew you'd been discovered. I feared the worst. Are you all right?"

King Olaf was Olaf One-Eye? He famously captured the dragon Numinex and took him to Dragonsreach. What do we say really happened?
"Strange. According to history Solitude attacked Winterhold, but Aesgeir seems to be saying Olaf reacted. What do we say happened?"
The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of honey I need to make my mead.
Sabjorn could use this interruption to his advantage and collect a larger share of the market. I can't have that.
Uncle Ralof! Can I see your axe? How many Imperials have you killed? Do you really know Ulfric Stormcloak?
"Look at you, almost a grown man! Won't be long before you'll be joining the fight yourself."
"Now, Ralof, what's going on? You two look pretty well done in."
I can't remember when I last slept...
"Where to start? Well, the news you heard about Ulfric was true. The Imperials ambushed us outside Darkwater Crossing."
"Like they knew exactly where we'd be. That was... two days ago, now."
"We stopped in Helgen this morning, and I thought it was all over. Had us lined up to the headsman's block and ready to start chopping."
The cowards!
"They wouldn't dare give Ulfric a fair trial. Treason, for fighting for your own people! All of Skyrim would have seen the truth then."
But then... out of nowhere... a dragon attacked...
"When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either."
"You don't mean, a real, live..."

"I can hardly believe it myself, and I was there."
"As strange as it sounds, we'd be dead if not for that dragon. In the confusion, we managed to slip away."
Are we really the first to make it to Riverwood?
"Nobody else has come up the south road today, as far as I know."
"Good. Maybe we can lay up for a while. I hate to put your family in danger, Gerdur, but..."
Nonsense. You and your friend are welcome to stay here as long as you need to.
Let me worry about the Imperials.
Any friend of Ralof's is a friend of mine.
Go and watch the south road. Come find us if you see any Imperial soldiers coming.
"Mind your mother, boy!"
"I'll let them into the house and, you know, show them where everything is..."
"Hmph. Help them drink up our mead, you mean."
"Good luck, brother. I'll see you later."
I told you my sister would help us out.
I hope to see you in Windhelm. Good luck.
Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.
Do you think that dragon is still flying around here somewhere?
"I almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon..."
Did you really see a dragon?
I bet my uncle Ralof is tougher than you are.
Make yourself at home.
I'm glad to help any way I can.
"Thanks, sister. I knew we could count on you."
"I ought to get back to work before I'm missed, but... did anyone else escape? Did Ulfric..."
Don't worry. I'm sure he made it out. It'll take more than a dragon to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.
"Because big, bad Brynjolf doesn't like the way I play thief."
"Look, he says we needed coin, so I got coin. Who cares if people got hurt? Blood washes off septims."
Now I'm sitting in here counting skeever droppings while he's drinking Black-Briar mead with Maven.
"Hey, if you're in good with Maven you've pretty much got it made."
"She's got friends in high places, and I don't just mean in Skyrim."
So getting the guards to throw me in here as a [QUOTE]punishment[QUOTE] was about as easy as falling off a log.
Got into a scrap a few years ago at the Ragged Flagon. Some idiot who stole himself a guard's sword and kept boasting about it.
He's making too much racket and I'm trying to get Vex drunk. So I tell him to keep it down and he just runs me through.
"Yeah, I was lucky though. After Vex tore the guy to pieces, she gave me a potion. If she hadn't of been there..."
"Anyway, after I got back to the Guild, I decided to start calling myself Twice-Killed."
"Yeah, but Twice-Killed has more of a ring to it!"
Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were finished.
Why are you standing here then?
I've told the captain of the guard we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here any minute.
"Well, Sabjorn. Now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?"
"Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet... I call it Honningbrew Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate."
By the Eight?! What... what's in this?
Shor's Bones! What... what's in this?
I... I don't know. What's wrong?
You assured me this place was clean! I'll see... see to it that you remain in irons for the rest of your days!
"No, please! I don't understand..."
"Silence, idiot! I should have known better... to trust this place after it's been riddled with filth."
I beg you... please. This is not what it seems!
And you... you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's prisons.
Now move.
Madanach. I've brought what you asked for.
Good work. Get ready while I have a word with our favorite outsider.
It wasn't easy getting all your things. A few guards had to have their throats slit.
I had Kaie recover all the things the Nords stole from you. You better get ready before we break out into the city.
And take this. It's blessed with the old magicks. Something to remember me by.
Good job!
Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!
Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got.
"Auxiliary, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open."
How's it going? You find anything yet?
Keep looking. There's got to be some way to get that gate open.
"This may sound obvious, but do you see a lever anywhere?"
"Alright, let's move, men! We've got more..."
"Steady, legionnaires! We've been through worse. Just keep your guard up!"
Follow me. Let's see where this leads.
Hadvar... get away from there!
We'll stay here and see if we can find anything else that could be of use.
There's no time! You have to get back to the College as fast as you can!
"Mirabelle is dead, and they're losing ground fast. I'd be there now if I hadn't seen... I had one of your 'visions', I think."
"Go on, get moving! I'll try and clear a path for you."

"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Bear pelts."

"These look like good quality, too. I know it's not the glamorous, heroic work, but don't be surprised if I ask you to do it again."
There's some trouble in Eastmarch. Farmers getting troubled by some bad types who've built up a stronghold in the area.
"There's some trouble in Falkreath. There's always some sort of trouble down there, but now it's come to a head."
"There's some trouble in Haafingar. The Legion's too busy with the war, and they're hiring us to take care of their problems."
"We've been hired to deal with some pests in Hjaalmarch. Someone's got them riled up, and you need to put an end to it."
There's some trouble in The Pale. We need you to go in and clear out an enemy stronghold.
"There's always some sort of trouble in The Reach, but a local warlord has raised the stakes. We have to handle the situation."
The Rift is seeing a lot of trouble from some riff-raff. We need to head in and break them up.
We've got trouble right here in Whiterun Hold. Nothing we can't handle.
"There's trouble up in Winterhold. I'm a little surprised anyone's complaining about it, but money is money."
"Nothing but a bunch of lowly bandits. Cowards, who will take little effort."
"The restless dead. Not pretty, but if you don't stop them, they'll move on to the locals."
The Falmer. There have been reports that they've been attacking people at night.
"It's a problem with the Forsworn. Unpredictable, unknowable, and dangerous. Be careful."
"It's a clan of giants. The war is driving them out of their lands, and they've started attacking settlements."
"You'll be clearing a nest of those Hagraven things. I've never faced one myself, but I hear... disturbing things about them."
"Oddly enough, Spriggans. Usually they let alone, but for some reason, this particular grove isn't."
"Bloodsuckers. Vampires. Take every precaution. One bite, and you could end up as one of them."
Rogue wizards. I've never trusted magic types. The College is bad enough. Destroy them.
I knew you could be counted on. Do what must be done.
Excellent. Show them no mercy.
Good. Do not spare them your blade.
"Shame. But, I'm sure one of the whelps around here will take it up."
"And I have already received word that the client is satisfied. You have done well for yourself, and for the Companions."
"Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks."
"I expected no less of you. And once again, you have not disappointed."
We've received a desperate missive.
Unfortunate. Let's be more careful next time.
So I hear. You've brought honor to the Companions and yourself.
Thank the Divines! Let's move!
"I'm ever so grateful. Please, give my regard to the rest of the Companions."
"Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener."

Good work. The mindless cretins didn't stand a chance.
"Not bad, not bad. The intensity of the hunt is special, isn't it?"
Good to hear. Have your share of the pay.
"I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone!"
"He treats me like a slave... I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery."
Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests infesting the meadery.
There's an entrance to it in the basement storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over.
I've already removed the boards so the meadery would get infested. That's where you should start.
Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.
I love it when a plan comes together.
"Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good."
Good luck. I'll be here if you need me.
Suit yourself.
Please hurry. The Captain of the Guard isn't patient when it comes to tasting time.
Now I've got to clean up this mess.
"Remember, you don't get paid until they're all dead."
One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.
"Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One way or another, we don't want the pests coming back."
"Consider it just more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you need to clear them out."
Are you kidding me? Look at this place.
I'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard.
"If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined."
Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back.
Nothing like free labor to make operating costs cheaper.
"Well... yes. I mean, all of the gold didn't come from me. I have a silent partner that helped with the finances."

Someone's got to head out there and take care of the beasts.
Ah. You must mean that one over there. He's not one of us.
"Thalmor filth, eh? Giving all Khajiit a bad name."
You must be new. We don't talk to each other here.
"You here to see Rulindil, too, eh? None of my business of course."
"Push off, will you?"
What did you tell him? Why did you do this to me?
You've got to help me! Please!
I don't know where I'll go. Somewhere far away from here.
Maybe this is a way out?
Maybe one of the guards had a key?
There's got to be some way out of here!
What did you tell him? Why did you do this to me?
Oh... thank you. I don't understand what's happening. I can't stay here. What will I do now?
What? Why? But... you must have said something to Erikur! You lied to him and now here I am! You're a heartless monster!
"No... please, you have to help me! You don't understand what they do to people here!"
Go. Out. Before I change my mind.
You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand.
"He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also going to dump it into the brewing vat."
"Good work. A simple job, but it keeps the coin rolling in. Here's your share."
I'm sure that the owner of that place is relieved. They certainly came through with the coin.
Well done. Here's your gold.
"He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door."
"Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me."
Climb down that ledge and see if you can...
"Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?"
It is. We train the bards you hear throughout the land. Viarmo is the head of the college and in charge of admissions.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work at here at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work over at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
"I'm a bard, trained at the Bards College in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying."
"I'm a bard, from the Bards College here in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying."
At the Bards College in Solitude. They train bards and skalds like myself.
"If you go there, talk to Viarmo. He's the headmaster."
Always a pleasure to meet a prospective bard.
You should be aware that many apply but we accept very few people.
"When possible, we ask applicants to perform tasks the college needs completed. In this case, I do have a task befitting an aspiring bard..."
As you may be aware Elisif's husband High King Torygg was recently killed.
Elisif mourns her husband deeply and she feels that a festival that burns a King in effigy is... distasteful.
I've tried to convince her the festival is many centuries old and celebrates Solitude but I need proof.
I believe King Olaf's verse will provide that proof.
"Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind."
"To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the verse was lost long ago."
I have to admit I didn't think it would actually be there.  Now let's take a look at this...
Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all.
"The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable."
And the parts that are readable... well... bardic verse has come a long way since ancient times.
"Ah wonderful, I knew it would be. This is a significant find."
I'll let Viarmo take possession but I will be looking forward to adding this to our library. Good work.
That's tremendous! I have to admit I didn't fully believe it still existed. Now let's take a look at this...
"Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all. The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable."
I knew it was at the Dead Man's Respite.
It means I can't read it to the court. Without the verse I won't be able to convince Elisif of the importance of The Burning of King Olaf Festival.
If she isn't convinced of the festival's importance then she won't reverse her decision to stop the effigy burning.
"It means that the Burning of King Olaf, which the Bards College has held for time immemorial, won't be happening."
Make it up? That doesn't seem appropriate...
I suppose I could copy his style based on what you brought me but I have no idea what happened in between these verses.
"Ha! All right, I'm writing that in. I'm not sure about the court but I find that much more probable than Olaf capturing a dragon."
"And they got the orders backwards. Ha ha ha.  Yes, I'm writing that in.  It should be good for a laugh from the court."
That was a close one!
It has a few final lines but that's all we needed to add. I need to head to court immediately and present this. You should come.

"I thank you and the college thanks you, Jarl."
"You have proven your point, Viarmo.  The festival is truly a celebration of Solitude and a condemnation of false kings."
"Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be moderately rewarded."

Unbelievable! You have done us a great service here. I can't begin to thank you enough.
"Soon, soon. These things must be done properly, you will be inducted as part of the Festival itself."
I need you to go speak to Jorn. He was preparing the Effigy of King Olaf.
"Tell him to finish the preparations, the Festival is back on."
I think they like you.
"Hmmm, Olaf did become king and Numinex escaped later. It's entirely possible... and I'm sure the court will like that, I'm writing it in."
I find that highly unlikely... but the court will love it. I'm writing it in.
I find that highly unlikely... I think it would be irresponsible to write that in to the verse.
It's not the most exciting answer but the most likely. I'll write it in.
Oh that is exciting! I'm sure the court and the Jarl will love it. I'm writing it in now.
"No, that's pushing it too far. Very exciting but highly unlikely, I can't possibly write that in."
"You're leaving? Okay, we'll just work on the verse in a bit."
That sounds good. I'm not sure the court will believe that Olaf had wizard powers but we shall see.
"Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart."
"If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off limits."
That's the best I can offer.
I've already provided you a key to the museum. You should consider it an honor. Few are allowed to browse my collection.
"I'm sorry, but that's as far as my generosity extends."

"First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it."
"See, there you go. Getting involved. Don't ask too many questions in Markarth. Safer for everyone that way."
"Jarl Igmund sits on the Mournful Throne. You can find him in the keep, in the back end of the city inside the mountain."
"You're our favorite kind of traveler, then. The market area is just inside in the gate."
"Head on in. Keep your nose clean, and you won't have any problems with us."
Margret!
Guards! Forsworn!
"Gods, not again...."
Halt. The Dwemer Museum isn't open to anyone without the court wizard's permission.
"Because Calcelmo doesn't want anyone to go in. He runs the museum, he makes the rules."
You have a problem with that? Go talk to him. You'll find him in front of the ruins during the day. Just down the tunnel.
"Calcelmo. He's the Jarl's magical advisor, but he spends most of his time studying the ruins."
"If you want in, Calcelmo has to give his say-so. He's usually in front of Nchuand-Zel. Just down the tunnel."
It means [QUOTE]Dwarven Museum.[QUOTE] Lost race of people that built the city.
"You want to know more? Ask Calcelmo. He's usually in front of the ruins, just down the tunnel."
"Correct. It's a private place where I can catalog my research. Occasionally, the Jarl will come in and have questions, but that's thankfully rare."
"Persistent aren't you? Oh, very well. Who am I to stand in the way of curiosity?"
"I'll let you in if you agree to something for me. There's a giant spider in Nchuand-Zel. My workers call her [QUOTE]Nimhe,[QUOTE] the poisoned one."
"If you deal with Nimhe, I'll let you into both the excavation site and my Dwemer Museum. What do you say?"
Enthusiasm. Good. Here's the key to the dig site.
"Oh, very well. Probably safest that way."
You have my gratitude. That spider had been interfering with my excavations for months.
"As promised, here's the key to the Dwemer Museum. Mind the displays. Some of them are quite fragile."
"Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me."
So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi.
"Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself!"
Exactly! And now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it?
"I was about to let that wench marry into the richest family in Riften, and this is how she repays me."
I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter. All I need to know is where she is.
"No, I'm sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else. I've never even heard that name before."
"I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about."
"Good, good. Just point me in the right direction and I'll do the rest."
Ivarstead? So close to Riften? She's an even bigger fool than I thought.
"So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake."
"No, no friend. You've got it all wrong. I'm not selling cheap mead. I'm selling good mead for cheap... Black-Briar Mead."
I sell cases of it for half of what the inns and taverns pay through the Meadery.
"All I need is someone to deliver it for me. If anyone saw me leave Riften, they'd get suspicious."
I need someone to take this small keg of Black-Briar Mead to Wilhelm at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead.
Drop it off and he'll trade you something for the delivery. Keep it as payment for the legwork.
"Oh, and if you bump into Indaryn from the meadery, keep your mouth shut. He'd rat us out in a second."
"All right, pipe down. You want the whole blessed place to hear you?"
The arrangement called for a trade. I hope you'll find this suitable.
We must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the Guild.
"You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer."
The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the Nightingales are sworn to protect with their lives.
Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within the walls of the Sepulcher.
Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.
"I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon."
"In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but given the circumstances I think he'd approve."
I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me.
"I think given time, you'll understand what I mean."
"Aye, I suspected as much but I've never been able to catch that little sneak with proof."
That fetcher! I gave him the same keg just this morning and told him to store it in the cellars.
"Oh, he'll rot in prison for this one I promise you. As soon as Maven finds out, it's all over for him."
"Here, take this as a bit of a reward for nabbing our little thief."
"Ah yes, excellent samples. Thank you. This coin should compensate you for all the bother."
Perfect. This is just what I needed. Here's some gold for your time.
"Good, my experiments are at a critical stage and these are just what I need to finish. Here's some coin for all the trouble."
Riften is drowning in a sea of sin and wickedness and it's my personal mission to let everyone know that the warmth of Mara can see them through.
All I need is a messenger to bring Her words to these poor souls by distributing these missives.
"Oh my, how wonderful! Lady Mara will be so pleased!"
"Here you are. Now make sure you give out every single one, we can't afford to let even one lost soul stray from Her warmth."
That's it. Keep hacking at it.
Don't stop. Keep cutting.
It's coming loose. I can feel it.
Wish I could say the same for us.
Tolfdir and I can try and keep this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now.
"I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it."
"Besides, you're the one having all of these visions, aren't you?"
I certainly hope so. I don't know how long we can keep this up.
"At least tell me where you're going, so we can send someone after you if you don't come back."
I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus's remains to lay to rest.
I promise to join you there as soon as I can.
"Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else."
"If you have further need of me, you can find me in the College."
Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.
Be careful.
I hope you enjoy touring the museum. Just don't touch anything.
"Oh, be certain to purchase my Falmer translation tome when it's completed!"
"Now, stand aside, there's work to be done."
"Try not to disturb me in the future, I'm in the midst of groundbreaking research!"
He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of academia... I was devastated when he was killed.
"I suppose that risk always coexisted with his line of work, I just never thought his luck would run out."
"Well, for the thrill of course."
He was quite clear that he felt more in his element climbing through a window rather than hunched over a dusty tome.
"Ah yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to break into my laboratory."
I was about to show him the error of his ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research notes.
I was astounded and in turn it lead to a conversation. Who'd have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?
Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel that even recognize the language?
I'm fairly certain he was planning some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer language.
"Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the details."
"Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you. To Markarth and Calcelmo."
I'm only hoping whatever means he used to learn the language will still be available to you.
What's this nonsense? Bah.
I'll read it. Thank you.
I don't have time for this nonsense.
"Seems like a noble cause, I'll look it over."
"If only more people would read this, things might be better in Riften."
"I don't understand how paper will help the dregs of this city, but suit yourself."
Do you take me for a fool? Get this drivel away from me!
Thank you. Blessings of Mara upon you as well.
Interesting. I'll look it over. Thanks.
"I hold my own beliefs, but thanks anyway."
"Mara this and Mara that. Where is she when hundreds of Stormcloaks are dying for no good reason, eh?"
"Not really my usual read, but I'll give it a try."
Mara can't help me. No one can.
"Oh, interesting. I'll read it this evening."
I have no desire to seek religion.
"I visit the temple sometimes, but perhaps not often enough. Thanks for bringing this to me."
"Thank you for the blessing, I'll put this to good use."
"Oh, well thank you. I'll try and read this if I can."
Are you out of your mind?
I think I have some more of these padding my mattress.
I have no time for Marla or Mara or whatever her name is... there's work to be done!
Had only Mara saved that poor animal...
"I'll give it a try, thanks very much."
Mara only helps those who can afford her tithes. This is nonsense.
"Oh, how kind! Thank you."
"Excellent, I needed some more kindling for my kitchen hearth."
"Whatever you're peddling, I'm not buying."
Are you serious? You're as crazy as Maramal.
"Look, the only religion I believe in is the good old septim. Everything else is just a waste."
"Ugh. Get this awful paper away from me, by Talos!"
"Oh, a new pamphlet from Dinya? I'll be glad to read it. Thanks."
"Huh? Oh. Sure, whatever. I prefer Dibella's teachings myself."
"Thank you. Umm, blessings upon you too."
I wouldn't even clean my tail with this trash.
"Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings."
Thank you. I'll share this with Aerin.
Hmmm. Never read anything from the temple before. I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in reading it.
Of course. Take what you need.
"Of course. Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know."
But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?
Of course. Take what you need.
But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?
Ralof? How do you know him?
"Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason."
You did? We heard that Ulfric was captured...
"... no, sorry, but in times like these I can't just take the word of a stranger who wanders into town claiming to be my brother's friend."
Just head north - you can't miss it. It's the capital of Whiterun Hold.
"Jarl Balgruuf still hasn't declared for one side or the other, so at least you won't run into any Imperials along the way."
Cross the river and then head north. You'll see Whiterun on its hill as you pass the falls.
"Oh, splendid! Just splendid! Mara smiles upon us this day."
"Allow me to give you her gift... a true blessing to aid you in times of need. Despair not, her warmth will protect you always!"
"I met her when I wandered into Riften a few years ago. Been smitten with her ever since. In fact, I'm thinking of asking her to marry me."
"In Black Marsh, tradition dictates we present a potential mate a unique wedding ring to represent our future bond."
"I already have the gold band, but all I need are three flawless amethysts to complete the setting."
The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.
"No, no! This can't be happening!"
Smithing's been in my blood for generations. I owe my success to my forefathers and their recipe for flame.
"The secret is my forge. It consumes fire salts, a strange mineral that burns as hot as Red Mountain lava."
"Well, it was. Sadly, this forge is dying and I've used the last of my fire salts. If I can't feed it soon, it may grow cold."
My previous champion displeases me.
It is time he is replaced - in the traditional fashion.
An astute observation.
"Skyrim is a beautiful and harsh mistress, but her people cling to such a petty notion of honor."
"When you told me of your intent to join the Thieves Guild, I honestly didn't think we'd have much to speak about ever again."
Yet here you are with my weapon that you could have easily sold or kept for yourself.
"Forgive me for my hasty opinion of you, I see that I was wrong and that there's much I can learn from you."
"If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time."
Astonishing. To think you actually were able to reach it and yet return to tell the tale.
Rarely in my travels have I encountered those who possess skills equal to your own.
"I see I still have much to learn. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time."
See? I knew Aren wouldn't leave me in here!
Hurry and get me out of this cage before they come for me!
They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their experiments.
"This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my help, not to use me as a test subject!"
"No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!"
Almost ever since he became leader of the tribe.
"He killed Shagrol in combat, which none of us thought possible. But the winner is made Chief. That is how it is done."
Sleep well?
The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?
"Does it matter? You're warm, dry... and still very much alive. That's more than can be said for old Grelod. Hmm?"
"I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like."
"Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech."
Are you joking?
"Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion."
Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.
Are you joking?
"Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion."
Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.
The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?
"I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems."
The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?
I can only imagine the headaches this is going to cause...
"Here, take this. Assuming they even honor it, you should be able to get your prisoner out."
What?
"Well... This seems to be in order. Very well, follow me."
We're right behind you.
"Lead on, we're ready."
We're with you.
Will do. Don't stray too far away or else we'll come after you.
"No problem, but if you get too far away, we're going to catch up."
"All right, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to come find you."
You beasts are the worst.
"Come now, dearie, surely we aren't all that bad."
"Just... leave me alone! I've brought your mead, now drink it and shut your filthy mouths."
"Oh, we've got other things in mind for our mouths, sweetie."
"Aye, the war keeps the Empire and the locals too busy to worry about us. Haldyn calls it [QUOTE]our golden age.[QUOTE]"
"Our secret ingredient, if you will."
A battle-mage of fearsome cunning.
"Runs the Blood Horkers, and makes sure the battles end right-side up."
"Adelaisa, I'm sorry."
"Sorry isn't good enough, Orthus. There's a lot of gold at stake here, and sniveling isn't going to get it back."
"Finally, someone around here that can get things done."
"Since we're short on soldiers you'll be coming with us, too. No arguments."
Anything else you want to say?
"Haldyn? I've heard of the man, but never guess he'd join up with some pirates."
This could be even more dangerous than I thought. Head to the ships. We'll plan the assault on the way.
"Well, here we are. We think."
"Don't know. Creepy fella, black robe. Couldn't see his face. Paid me a pretty sum to get that into your hands, though."
Do I make myself clear?
You've decided to help?
Don't be sorry for me. I just - if I would have known it would come to this. Mother...
All right. Mother is just outside this door. I have a plan.
"I'll present you as the sacrifice. Just play along. While mother begins the ritual, I'll strike. Then, together we can... we can kill her."
"I've thought this through, and it's the only way. She's too far gone, too corrupted by the Hags. At least in death she can be free again."
Enough. Let's go.
You found what?
"Hmm. Well now. Yes, this might actually be something interesting. You'd better show that to Tolfdir right away."
You found what?
"Hmm. Well now. This is all very fascinating, but I don't recall asking to you to touch anything in here."
"I suppose you'd better show that to Tolfdir nonetheless. And please, ask before tampering with anything else."
"As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest."
"Sacked by the elves in the infamous [QUOTE]Night of Tears,[QUOTE] not much is known about what happened to Saarthal."
"This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used..."
"Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting."
Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place?
What do you think we'll find in there?
It's thousands of years old. Who knows what we might find?
I'm betting bodies. Lots and lots of bodies. And maybe some valuables...
"Don't get any ideas. We're here on official business, remember?"
"Are you excited to see what's in there? This is important to you Nords, isn't it?"
"Not excited, no. Some very bad things happened here."
"Oh, right. That whole thing with the elves. Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?"
"I think, given the state of Skyrim, some might disagree."
This is a little creepy.
That doesn't begin to describe it.
You seem uncomfortable being here.
"I just don't know that it's right for us to be in here like this, picking through the ruins ."
"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this isn't it."
"There's no gold, nothing shiny at all."
Don't sound so disappointed. You wouldn't be allowed to take it even if there was.
"Like anyone would even notice, in all this mess."
"All right, calm down, no need to for that. I'll let you in right away, just need to get the gate unlocked."
I think you'd be a little smarter than that.
Ooooh...yes...yes. You've fallen for my trap! Greed makes a great lure. Odd you didn't die from the fall though. Most do.
"Alright, let's see if we have something here to end this as quickly as possible."
Don't worry though. It'll be relatively painless...relatively.
"Oh, and don't mind my assistant here. He may have seen better days, but he's still more help to me dead than he was alive."
It's got to be somewhere around here! Now where did I put it?
Hhhmmm...maybe I put it over here.
"Ah...Here it is. Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand still this will be much easier for me to do."
"Oh, and I wasn't entirely truthful before. This is actually going to hurt a lot. You see, you have to be dead in order for the spell to take hold."
Come on! You know you want what's in that chest. Just walk toward it!
Just walk toward the chest! Gravity will do the rest.
I know you're up there. Go get the treasure. Doesn't it look pretty?
"I am Tsun, shield-thane to Shor."
"The Whalebone Bridge he bade me guard and winnow all those souls whose heroic end sent them here, to Shor's lofty hall"
"where welcome, well-earned, awaits those I judge fit to join that fellowship of honor."
Constance!
"Yes, Grelod?"
"Samuel is getting to be a problem. Fancies himself something of a [QUOTE]leader[QUOTE] to the other children. Put an end to the nonsense, or I will."
"Hroar's crying is keeping me up at night. I'll give you one chance to talk the tears out of him, or he's getting the belt."
I can't abide Samuel's constant talk of his parents. [QUOTE]They're coming for me.[QUOTE] [QUOTE]This is only temporary.[QUOTE] The boy must accept his fate.
"Seven septims are missing from my purse. I know it was Runa. You get those coins back, or by Stendarr, I'll see her rot in the dungeon."
This place is filthy. I've a mind to cancel all town privileges unless those brats start pulling their weight.
"The stores are running low. We'll need to water down the milk again. Besides, don't want the little darlings getting fat."
"We haven't had an adoption in months. At this rate, we'll be stuck with these brats forever. We need to get the word out. A sale, if need be."
All right. I'll take care of it.
I'll handle it. No need to blow things out of proportion.
"Please, just let me handle it. It's not a problem."
"Okay, okay. I'll deal with it."
What do you want? You have no business being in here.
You did? Really?
This is the best news I've ever gotten!
"I mean, I knew the Dark Brotherhood was good... just not that good! You killed the old hag before I even asked!"
"Oh, and please, take this as payment. It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!"
Thank you again for resolving my... problem.
"Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?"
Need a room? Or maybe just some mead?
Something I can get for ya?
"I can't help you, friend. Talk to Hadring, the Innkeeper."
I value my privacy. So if you don't mind?
"I really don't mean to be rude, friend, but I'm not feeling particularly sociable..."
"Hadring got himself another customer, eh?"
"The beds and beer are both lousy, you ask me."
What do you want?
Which one was the rat?
Dunno. One of these corpses. Does it matter?
"Suppose not. But what's taking the others so long? The sooner we get out of here, the better. Smoke's getting bad. This place'll be raging soon."
"Arcturus took some men deeper in, wanted to be sure. We should maybe... assist them."
You assist all you like. And get roasted for your trouble. I'll guard the exit.
"Please hurry. To be honest, I'm kind of lonely here. As much as I hated getting sent to Honorhall, I really miss my friends there..."
You've taken up enough of my time. Now leave.
Think you can intimidate me? In my own orphanage? Ha! Not bloody likely.
What? Who are you? How did you get this far?
"Your corpse will feed my spiders for weeks. Now die, you fool!"
"She got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just... she never got better. Not all year. One night she fell asleep and...  never woke up."
So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!
I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Someone like Grelod doesn't deserve to live one more day. She's a monster.
Who's there?
Is someone following me?
You're trailing me? I knew I heard something.
Ha! I knew it was you all along.
"Following me, huh? You're not very good at this are you?"
"You may as well give up, I see you there."
Must be my imagination.
Damn ears... playing tricks on me again. Can't stand this sea air!
Hey... is someone watching me?
"I swear, if I'm being followed..."
I swear I feel like I'm being watched.
"If this keeps up, I'm headed back to the Winking Skeever."
"I don't have time to chase shadows, I've got better things to do."
"It's really dead, then?"
"I never would have believed it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes..."
"It may be dead now, but... where did it come from?"
"In all my years, I've never seen such a thing..."
Something's happening...
What manner of magic is this?
Look out! Don't get too close!
It's like the ancient legends. Dragonborn...
It can't be... You... You took its very soul...
By the gods... I don't even know what to say...
It would seem our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.
Goldenglow Estate provided a huge payout for us before Aringoth locked us out.
Maven looked the other way as long as the honey kept flowing and we kept him in line.
Let's not kid ourselves. Black-Briar Mead is swill. The only thing keeping it successful is Maven.
"Word on the street was that Honningbrew tasted better, cost less and Sabjorn didn't shove it down everyone's throat."
"If Sabjorn ever managed to push Maven off her pedestal, we'd all be in trouble."
"Look, in case you hadn't noticed, these aren't the glory days of the Guild."
"We've lost more clients in the last decade than I'd care to count, but Maven's stuck with us through throughout the entire ordeal."
"I'll be damned if I'm going to lose her to... well, to whatever they are."
You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his attention.
"If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use it as leverage."
"Yes, we spoke at length while you were in Whiterun dealing with our meadery situation."
I hope for all your sakes you find out who's behind this supposed [QUOTE]plot.[QUOTE]
Having Goldenglow kept in line by the Thieves Guild has kept the honey flowing with minimal cost.
"Now, mysteriously, some sort of anonymous adversary shows up and takes the Estate out of my hands."
"When you've been doing business like I have for decades, you quickly discover that the only person you can trust is yourself."
"If you were to bring me the deed to Goldenglow Estate, so I was the full owner, that would be a step in the right direction."
"Since I know losing the farm's payments will harm the Guild, I intend to make a substantial contribution for compensation."
I take care of my friends.
What's going on? What happened in there?
What's going on? What happened in there?
It 'may be' in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much question.
Let's get down there. We have to do something.
That's certainly an understatement. I've never seen anything like this!
"Well, I suppose we can't just stand here. We'd better do something."
"We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation."
"We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation."
"I'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation."
"I'll go with you, but when things are back to normal I want an explanation."
By the gods...
Dragon!
"Everyone, inside. Now!"
We must clear this confounding mist.
"Alduin will hide in this lightless mist until we Shout together, and shatter his power."
We must Shout together these shadows to dispel.
"We're ready, Dragonborn, our wrath to unleash."
Again!
"Again, together! Alduin is strong!"
"Again, as one! The World-Eater fears us!"
We can shatter his power if we Shout together!
Ven Mul Riik!
"This was a mighty deed! The doom of Alduin encompassed at last, and cleansed is Sovngarde of his evil snare."
They will sing of this battle in Shor's hall forever. But your fate lies elsewhere.
"When you have completed your count of days, I may welcome you again, with glad friendship, and bid you join the blessed feasting."
"When you are ready to rejoin the living, just bid me so, and I will send you back."
"The eyes of Shor are upon you this day. Defeat Alduin, and destroy his soul-snare."
All hail the Dragonborn! Hail him with great praise!
All hail the Dragonborn! Hail her with great praise!
"The endless wait gives way to battle! Alduin's doom, his death or ours!"


Fen du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
Zu'u lost daal.
Kel drey ni viik.
Di kiirre fen alok.
Daar Lein los dii.
Hin sil fen nahkip bahloki.
Pahlok joorre! Hin kah fen kos bonaar.
"Zu'u Alduin, zok sahrot do naan ko Lein."
Nust wo ni qiilaan fen kos duaan.
"Dovahkiin, hin kah fen kos bonaar."
"Zu'u lost kriaan hi ont, nu hin sille fen nahkip suleyki."
Zu'u ni faas gaaffesejul.
"Dovahkiin, you should not have come here. Nu hin sil dii."
I have already defeated your friends once. Beyn. I do not fear them.
"You are persistent, Dovahkiin. Pruzah ol aar. A fine slave you would have made."
"My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!"
"Face me, then! Zu'u Alduin!"
Does his strength have no end? Is our struggle in vain?
"Stand fast! His strength is failing! Once more, and his might will be broken!"
"One more time, and the World-Eater must face us!"
His power crumbles - do not pause for breath!
"Again, and we break his grim hold over Shor's realm, and redeem it for eternity!"
Not here. Come with me.
Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.
I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it?
"Well, what is it you want?"
So. You're an Imperial spy... Interesting...
"I have no strong love for the Stormcloaks but I can't say I'm all that fond of the Empire, either."
This war of yours makes it difficult for a resourceful woman to advance her interests.
Perhaps we can find a way for both of us to prosper from this unfortunate discovery?
So. You're one of Ulfric's spies...
I can't deny the man is right about a few things...
"But I've seen first hand what Ulfric is capable of, given the chance. Suffice it to say, he is no friend to Markarth, and no friend of mine."
"My first and only loyalties are to my nephew, and to this city."
What if I told you about a large shipment of gold and weapons?
What if I told you about a large shipment of silver and weapons?
Excellent. I can move more soldiers through the area now that I know those scouts are dead.
"Good job! With those Imperial scouts out of the way, I can be more aggressive about where I send our men."
Good. They'll think twice before crossing us while their command structure is in disarray.
I pray Talos overlooks our less than honorable approach. But he knows our purpose is just and true. I'm glad you made it out alive.
Good work. This was a double victory. We took a garrison away from the Stormcloaks and further proved the hollowness of their cause.
"Excellent. That's one less settlement in Imperial hands, and one more sign to all that our cause is true."
"Good work. I'll send some men with a wagon to collect the prize. We can use the weapons here, and I'll pass on the coin to Solitude."
"Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm."
"Good job. The more citizens that join the fight against the rebels, the sooner they will see the futility of their rebellion."
We grow that much stronger with each son and daughter of Skyrim who joins us. Down with the Emperor!
Thanks for taking care of that. I don't think that will be the last we see of that Orc. It's always good to gain allies.
"Thanks for dealing with that orc. Something tells me that's not the last time we'll see him. And, something tells me that might not be a bad thing."
Good job! I knew I gave the mission to the right person.
Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!
I'll be fine. I just need a minute to catch my breath. Find Savos...
Well? What word of the Emperor?
Truly?
"Could you have brought us more wondrous news? Recent events notwithstanding, this is a happy day for us, my friend."
"Despite your misfortunes, you stayed true to the Dark Brotherhood. You've saved us all, and for this you have my eternal thanks."
"Now, of course I must ask... Killing the Emperor... How much did Motierre pay for such a thing?"
"Ha! Remarkable! Well, the old bastard certainly made it worth your while, didn't he?"
"Ha! Clearly, we should have killed that old bastard years ago!"
Oh. Is that all? Really?
Come now! You're joking with old Nazir! Surely the Emperor's life was worth more than that.
"Pfft. You'd think an emperor would fetch at least twice that. Damn that motherless cheapskate, Motierre."
"In any event, here's my advice. Go to Riften's Ratway, find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before, no?"
"Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh?"
"Ha! I knew it, you rascal! By Sithis, the old man was worth the trouble."
This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through her Steward's private quarters.
You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.
"Good. I can always count on you, can't I?"
"I can always count on you, can't I?"
You fought well. I find you worthy.
It is long since one of the living has entered here. May Shor's favor follow you and your errand.
Alduin escaped us long ago. Today we take our well-tempered revenge.
For a hundred lifetimes my heart has burned for revenge on Alduin too long delayed.
Clear Skies - combine our Shouts!
We cannot fight the foe in this mist!
Get moving.
I can't believe we're finally getting out.
No turning back now.
Get going.
"Come on, move it. We have Nords to kill."
Glory to the Forsworn!
For the Forsworn!
Your time runs short.
"Please, we do not have much time."
"My brothers, we have been here long enough. It's time to leave Cidhna Mine and continue our fight against the Nords."
"Through this gate, just beside my quarters, is a tunnel. A tunnel that leads right through the old Dwarven ruins of Markarth, into the city."
"Well, what do you say, my brothers?"
I say you've earned an early pardon. Let's go.
It's a little gift from the dwarves. Who knew they would end up helping our cause?
We have to move. We'll talk more once we see the sky.
Into the tunnel. Let's go.
"It is done. Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, and the Dark Brotherhood yet lives."
I was approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for something big.
She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate.
I brought him the coin and walked away with her copy of the deed.
Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the job. I'm sure you understand.
"However, I did notice she was quite angry and it was being directed at Mercer Frey."
In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how much coin we carry.
"Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the answers."
"Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way."
Aha! You're back!
I know! I know! I received the news not moments ago! Ha ha! This is glorious!
"My friend, you may not realize it, but you have served the Empire, indeed all of Tamriel, in ways you cannot possibly imagine."
"Ah, but you care little for politics, am I right? You want money! And money you shall have!"
"Your payment waits for you at a dead drop. It is inside an urn, in the very chamber where we first met, in Volunruud."
"Now please, go. Collect your money, and let us never look upon one another again. Our business, thank the gods, is concluded."
"Your payment awaits. And don't worry, I'm not stupid enough to betray you."
"Oh, for the love of Mara, would you please just go?"
And what might that be?
"You assassins and your riddles. It really does get very annoying, you know. Now if you'll excuse me..."
"Ha! Well, I certainly do feel that way."
"Now, if, um... you'll get going?"
Yes? No? Nothing?
"Very well, then. If you'll just... get going now..."
"All right. Had I known the deal would bring me this much trouble, I never would have accepted the gold."
"I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me!"
"But of course. You and I have a date with destiny. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?"
"Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is."
But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
I thank you for your courtesy.
"You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition."
"So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion."
"This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery."
"Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?"
"Oh, you can save your sinister bravado. I'll not go to my grave whimpering like an infant."
I know why you're here. I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
"You and I have a date with destiny, it would seem. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?"
"Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is."
But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
"Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking."
"Tsk. How unfortunate. I had hoped you would honor an old man's dying wish. Well, let's be done with it then."
"You will hear me out, then? Good."
"You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition."
"So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion."
"This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery."
"Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?"
"Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with."
"Don't you have all the information you need? Please, the Emperor isn't going to kill himself. Hmph. Now wouldn't that be a blessing..."
Thank you.
"Now, on to the business at hand I suppose, hmm?"
Hmph. Pity. I had hoped to obtain even a modicum of justice.
"Well, on to the business at hand then, hmm?"
"Well. Perhaps you'll at least consider it, hmm?"
"Now, on to the business at hand..."
By the gods. You... you're alive! But I had heard... your Sanctuary...
Please! You mustn't think I had anything to do with that! I wanted the Emperor dead! The true Emperor! I still do! It was Maro! He...
"You mean, after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will still... honor the contract?"
"Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful news!"
"The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's onboard his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude Inlet. But you must hurry!"
"If you can get onboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as contracted... I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment."
"Well, I don't know."
It's in the Solitude Inlet - that's the channel just north of the docks.
I suppose you should go to the docks and... swim?
Surely you're joking?
"This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you."
Still... everyone assumes the Dark Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual.
"Indeed. And so you have come looking, though you do not know why."
"Like others before you, you blindly follow a path to your own destruction."
"The Thalmor came seeking answers as well, unaware they will be his undoing."
"Your path now follows his, though you will arrive too late."
You seek that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge.
You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume.
"You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it."
"The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others."
There is no help for you here.
There is no solace in knowing what is to come.
Your perseverance will only lead you to disappointment.
"Still you persist? Very well, you may enter."
Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood.
"I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain."
"I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain."
"Well met, mage of Skyrim."
"The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall."
Here in Shor's house we honor it still.
"You trespass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you."
Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way.
"Welcome I do not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand."
"Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle."
"Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand."
"Shor's favor has found you, Dragonborn. The Hall of Valor, heart's-ease, awaits."
"Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down there, please do be careful."
"Very well. It's not something often discussed, as it might be... misunderstood by the locals."
"The Augur is down in the Midden, below the College. I don't recommend going down there unless it's absolutely necessary."
"My note? No, that's yours. Must have fallen out of your pocket."
Astrid is dead. It is as it should be. May she find redemption in the Void.
"But while you live, the Dark Brotherhood lives. We must fulfill our contract. Emperor Titus Mede II must be eliminated."
Speak with Amaund Motierre at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He will know the true Emperor's location.
"But first, inform Nazir of your plans. For you are the Listener, and must bind this Family together."
Don't you know? What drew you here? Surely your dreams showed you the way?
"The Hall of Valor, where heroes wait to follow Shor to the final battle."
That's a decent weapon you've made there.
That's a decent weapon you've made there.

That's some good armor you've put together.
That's some good armor you've put together.
Look out!
"Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy."
A storeroom. See if you can find any potions. We'll need them.
"A storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving."
Hear that?
Come on!
Was Jarl Ulfric with you?
Shor's bones. We were too late. Damn the Empire.
"No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up."
Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.
"All right, Brand-Shei. Turn out your pockets, we know you have it."
Have what? What in blazes are you talking about?
Don't play stupid. I said turn out your pockets... now!
"I'm telling you, I don't... wait, what's this ring? This isn't mine!"
"That's right. It isn't yours. You're under arrest, Brand-Shei."
This is insane! I didn't steal anything! I never saw this ring before in my entire life!
"We can do this one of two ways. You can walk with me up to the keep, or I can drag your lifeless body. Your choice."
But... I... very well.
I'll make the preparations immediately!
"Strong, yes, but how clever are you? I'll tell you what, if you can open the lock on my chest, you can have everything in it."
"I'll take your challenge, but if I win I get to start a new life as an adventurer, and with no objections from you."
"I want to be an adventurer like you, but my father says I can't."
"He says that he needs me to stay here and work the farm, and even if he did let me be an adventurer, we couldn't afford to buy armor."
"His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind."
"You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something. Will you hear me out?"
Thank you. I can't stand the thought of being trapped in this village for the rest of my days.
"Turn back, traveler! Terror waits within this mist."
Many have braved the shadowed vale but vain is all courage against the peril that guards the way.
"In life I felled foes unnumbered, fearless in battle; but no blade can defend against the terror of this gloom-stricken valley."
"When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping."
"I faced him fearlessly - my fate inescapable, yet my honor is unstained - can Ulfric say the same?"
"When I woke from cold death, my doom was lifted - there was Shor's Hall, my heart's desire."
"But now I wander, weary and lost. Alduin hunts me as we once hunted our prey - a bitter payment for many bloody deeds."
The bitter war of the world beyond was all for naught.
"We are all trapped in Alduin's web - for our allegiance he cares not, but devours us equally - doom unescapable."
"Shor as well - he welcomes all heroes to his kingly hall, if we could but reach it."
"Skyrim was betrayed, the blood of her sons spilled in doomed struggle against fate."
"And so in death, too late, I learn the truth - fed by war, so waxed the power of Alduin, World-Eater - wisdom now useless."
"By gods' jest in this grim mist together snared, Stormcloak and Imperial, we wander hopeless, waiting for succor."
"Dragonborn, even in death you dog my steps?"
"How come you here? The king of this realm will cast you out - cursed be your name by all sons of Skyrim, with scorn unceasing."
Do you know the way? I'm weary and lost.
Turn back! Before he finds you!
"Near Giants' Gap, in the gloom before dawn, we marched, unsuspecting into the Imperials' trap."
"Then we stood and fought, our shield-wall defending until by dawn's light the Legion's ranks wavered."
But I never knew if nights-end brought victory - a swift-flying arrow to Sovngarde carried me.
I do not know - but none have passed through.
"Alduin, his hunger insatiable, hunts the lost souls snared within this shadowed valley."
"Can you lead the way to where Shor's hall waits, beckoning us on to welcome long sought?"
"I saw it fair when first I trod this long-sought path. The pain and fear vanished, dreamlike, and a vision beckoned -"
"Shor's hall, shimmering across the clouded vale. But quenched was hope by the shrouding mist - my mind is darkened."
I've lost the way and wander blindly.
Hurry! Before Alduin your life devours bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!
"I'll try to hold to your hopeful purpose. Quickly, before this encompassing fog once more snares me in the World-Eater's net."
The World-Eater waits within the mist! Bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!

This is all very strange. I've never seen anything like this.
I think perhaps it might be best if you lead the way. My eyes aren't what they used to be.
"Don't worry, I'll stay right with you."
What is it? I said I didn't wish to... be disturbed.
It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim.
"But the token of my truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted by a profane darkness skittering within."
Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is as it should be. This is because of you.
A new day is dawning. And you shall be its herald.
"Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my name, that my influence may grow."
May the light of certitude guide your efforts.
"It matters not. The plant cares nothing for the rays that bring it the warmth of the sun. As you carry Dawnbreaker, so will my light touch the world."
"The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding."
"Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds."
"I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my artifact, and destroy the defiler."
Guide my light through the temple to open the inner sanctum and destroy the defiler.
"But a single candle can banish the darkness of the entire Void. If not you, then someone else."
My beacon is sure to attract a worthy soul.
"But if you are wise, you will heed my bidding."
Of course you will. I have commanded it!
"Go now, the artifact must be reclaimed and Malkoran destroyed."
"Malkoran has forced the doors shut. But this is my temple, and it responds to my decree."
I will send down a ray of light. Guide this light through my temple and its doors will open.
A new hand touches the beacon.
You have found my beacon.
But it is not time for rejoicing. The defiler continues to profane my temple.
"Return to my figure on Mount Kilkreath, and I shall make you the instrument of my cleansing light."
Do you prefer heedlessness to my luminous glory? Go!
Take my beacon to the mount above Kilkreath.
Can you not hear me? Are your ears full of hate?
The defiler waxes!
"Go now, with haste. Take my beacon to Mount Kilkreath."
Fool! He is perverting my Light.
A Light that could illuminate Skyrim and her people.
Is that confidence I hear... or is it arrogance? Strange how often they're confused.
"You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me anyone I can rely on."
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
"Once again Brynjolf sends me someone with no backbone, no determination."
Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he did.
"In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to market and a chunk of my profits with it!"
I can't imagine where he found the gold to take it to market so quickly.
"Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close."
Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.
"Maven Black-Briar's gone out of her way to try and have me shut down, but fortunately I have a good relationship with Whiterun's Jarl."
"Every year, I sell more Honningbrew and Maven loses customers. Know why? My mead tastes better."
"We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother."
We better get moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
There you go. You may as well take Gunjar's gear. He won't be needing it any more.
I'm going to see if I can find some way out of here.
Damn. No way to open this from our side.
Maybe one of these Imperials had the key.
"Here we are, found a key. Let's see if it opens that door."
"That's it! Come on, let's get out of here before the dragon brings the whole tower down on our heads."
Looks like we're the only ones who made it.
This one's locked. Let's see about that gate.
Listen. All of you!
I have little need for mindless thralls.
"My servants serve their own purposes. But, if their will is insufficient, nor suitably aligned with mine, I simply destroy them."
Which brings me to my present concern.
I am loath to utter his name... one cannot erase a thing if it has a name to be remembered.
"You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with your talents."
Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.
"Remember always this: As you will it, so it shall be."
You have earned the right to call yourself my Champion.
And now you must perform the task for which I created you. You have already proven to possess the needed skills.
Go to Solitude. Stalk the Jarl and slay her.
"I have spread rumors of an assassin. It will make your job harder, but will allow me to place blame where I desire it."
"You will need stealth and lies to get past her guards. You will assassinate her swiftly and quietly. And if combat finds you, survive the escape."
"Succeed, and you may keep your title and my armor, and I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Blackness."
Failure is not an option.
"You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about it."
Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.
"Remember always this: You need answer to no authority, neither mortal, nor divine... As you will it, so it shall be."
Ah. Well. Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
"Only this. You have the Thu'um of a dovah, but without the wings of one, you will never set foot in Skuldafn."
Of course... I could fly you there. But not while imprisoned like this.
"Indeed. Orin brit ro. I cannot leave here until you defeat Alduin, which you cannot do without my help."
"Ahraan. You wound me, Dovahkiin. I may not tell the whole truth, but I am no liar."
Go and see for yourself. Zu'u ni bo nol het. I will be here... unless Alduin returns before you do.
"You have reconsidered my offer, hmm? Onikaan kron?"
Zu'u ni tahrodiis. It was you that lured me here and took me prisoner... vobalaan grahmindol. I have done nothing to earn your distrust.
"Hin aar, orin nu. And yet here I am, still your prisoner."
Onikaan koraav gein miraad. It is wise to recognize when you only have one choice.
And you can trust me. Zu'u ni tahrodiis. Alduin has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now.
"Free me, and I will carry you to Skuldafn."
Amativ! Mu bo kotin stinselok.
"This is far as I can take you. Krif voth ahkrin. I will look for your return, or Alduin's."
Hin laas los dii.
Fent ni filok.
Sosaal fah hin vothaarn.
Zu'u uth nall thurri dein daar miiraak.
Alduin mah nol thur.
Alduin sizaan midroti.
Dovahkiin zol mul. Zu'u gahvon miri Alduin.
"Saraan uth - I await your command, as promised. Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?"
Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?
"Zok brit uth! I warn you, once you've flown the skies of Keizaal, your envy of the dov will only increase."
"Kreh zini! The freedom of the sky beckons! Yet I stay here, nau gol, as promised."
You sure about that? You want to let that dragon loose after all the trouble to catch him in there?
Your funeral. Someone else is gonna have to help you get him back in there again.
"Hey, when you make up your mind, just let me know. I'll be here."
This seems like a really bad idea to me.
"Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name across his network of contacts."
"For twenty-five years I ran, never sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks."
Mercer doesn't need to die... he needs to feel the cold sting of fate as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.
"I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I won't hesitate."
"He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone respected him and followed him without question."
It was Gallus who inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a razor sharp point. I owe everything to him.
We were... very close.
Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what happened to him.
"Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what's known as the Nightingale Trinity."
The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.
She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every thief in Tamriel.
"Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests and no sermons, no services and no alms."
She influences our luck and in return demands payment.
You're closer to understanding than you realize.
The only difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense and sometimes the cost can be quite high.
"Whether you know it or not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues."
"Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how our luck behaves?"
Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his pocket?
It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences us.
Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have been volumes written on the subject.
Does she exact payment when we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one knows.
The return certainly seems worth the risk though.
Don't leave me here!
"I, uhh... wait, what?"
"He gets the books, I get you. It's very simple."
"She gets the books, I get you. It's very simple."
"You wouldn't do that, would you? You wouldn't leave me here with her!"
I'm waiting.
Fine. Take your books and leave at once.
"If you ever come back, I won't be so gracious."
Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in combat.
Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?
Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful.
"You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise."
We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?
"If you wish to gain Boethiah's attention, you must slay a thrall upon her shrine."
"A well placed word, or a well placed dagger. Both can achieve equal purposes."
Do you wish to test yourself against me?
"Though we live in shadow, we carve indelible signs of our passing into the world."
We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the world through our tongues and our blades.
"You? You are nothing. An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze."
"The Lord of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Devourer of Trinimac. The Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, He-Who-Destroys and She-Who-Erases..."
"Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end of time - it is for naught."
"Names mean nothing to our Lord. She only cares for those who care for themselves, whose hearts are full of purpose, whose lives are full of deeds."
You are nothing.
Good. Perhaps I've misjudged.
"If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do."
"First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above."
"Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless."
"Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you."
"If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us."
"That remains to be seen. But if it is so, and if Boethiah appears, then we will welcome you as one of us."
Then you are weak and inconsequential.
Our Lord! She has come!
(Gasps)
"She is here, among us."
Shhh! Be still. Beware her anger!
My favor?
My good pleasure is not some trophy for mortal sport!
I should slay you for such insolence!
"Were you certain in your purpose, you would have no need to apologize."
You have much to learn... But you have proven your will is strong and your heart is devoid of pity.
"So, perhaps you are not entirely useless... We shall soon find out."
Hear me!
"I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's doing in there!"
"Ancano. He's in there, doing... something. We don't know what. We're trying to get in now."
"I will have his head for this, I assure you."
"Help take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it."
"Excellent. I'd suggest that we go retrieve it immediately, but right now we have more pressing matters."
"Ancano has somehow locked himself in the hall. He's up to something, and I intend to put a stop to it."
"Help us get through this, will you? We're throwing everything we have at it."
Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going on.
What's going on?!
Ancano! Stop this at once! I command you!
Don't go near him!
Are you all right? Can you walk?
I need you on your feet. We're in trouble here.
Ancano is doing something with that thing... the Eye. We can't stop him!
"I haven't seen Savos since the explosion. He must've been blown clear, and he may be injured."
"I need you to find the Arch-Mage, and I need you to do it quickly. Get moving!"
"Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine."
The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.
War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that.
"Dengeir deserves more respect than his nephew, Jarl Siddgeir, affords him."
"Without birth there is no life, without death there is only stasis. Such is the truth of Arkay."
Strangers like you bring war. I've seen enough war.
These graves hold the sons and daughters of Falkreath.
Show respect while you're here and you and I will be fine.
You have the look of a killer.
Arkay helps us find peace with death.
Indara and I like to keep to ourselves and run our farm.
Runil has been a true friend to my wife and I in our time of need.
"My wife, Indara, has a gift with animals.  It makes her a better farmer than anyone I've ever seen."
This war isn't needed. Imperials like my wife can be hard to handle but we Nords could work with them. I should know.
"I don't know if the war is Arkay's will or man's, but it's none of my doings."
My husband Mathias and I tend Corpselight Farm.
Falkreath is a hard place and tending a farm here is thankless work.
Mathies is a kind and wise man. The Nords could use more like him. So could the Imperials.
How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?
"Steel's good, but loyalty's better. I'm loyal to Dengeir first and the Empire second."
Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.
The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.
"Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood."
"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
"Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?"
Don't let the shop's name frighten you away. I have plenty of reliable tonics and healing potions to sell.
"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.
A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!
"Stay out of my way, boot."
I can't believe we let provincials like you wander Skyrim.
You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.
"Well met. Unlike my brother, I've no dislike of strangers. Met lots of 'em while I was a Stormcloak."
Can I get you something?
Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.
Looking for something?
"What do you need, stranger?"
Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath.
You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.
A strong drink will chase off that chill in the air.
"I've half a mind to ask if you'll take me on one of your adventures, but I can't just leave Valga on her own."
Not much exciting happens around here. You're as like as not to be bored to death if you stay too long.
Anything I can get you?
Can I get you a drink?
Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.
I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.
I wouldn't complain if we could string together a few sunny days now and then.
"Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us."
"I'm sorry, I should really go now."
"I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid."
"I was Jarl once, but I was encouraged to step down when I took sides with the Stormcloaks. It was an imperial plot, I tell you!"
"Be mindful. My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to that pompous nephew of mine, Siddgeir."
Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.
"If you're sympathetic to the Empire, you'll be wise to put Falkreath far behind you."
"My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl."
Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.
"The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies."
"I protect the Jarl, whoever that might be."
Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.
Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.
"Treat the Jarl with respect, and you'll be welcome here."
I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.
Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.
For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.
Yes? What is it that you want?
Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.
The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.
There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.
"No time, I have business to conduct."
"Unless you intend to bury someone, this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler."
Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.
Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.
My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.
"Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine."
The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.
War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that.

How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?
Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.
The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.
"Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood."
"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
"Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?"
If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.
"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!
"Stay out of my way, boot."
Can't believe we let provincials like you wander around Skyrim.
That Valga Vinicia is a gossip and a troublemaker.
You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.
Can I get you something?
Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.
Looking for something?
"What do you need, stranger?"
Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath.
You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.
Anything I can get you?
Can I get you a drink?
Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.
"In Falkreath if I don't know it, it's not worth knowing."
I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.
"From maid to Steward, I can hardly believe it. I hope I'm up to the task."
"Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us."
"I'm sorry, I should really go now."
"I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid."
Be mindful.  My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to Siddgeir.
"My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl."
Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.
Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.
"The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies."
Nenya's history of service is impeccable.  She truly is the Steward of Falkreath.
Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.
Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.
Dengeir was a good Jarl in his day.  Even if his day has passed.
I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.
Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.
For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.
Stand aside.  I don't need to speak to you.
Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.
The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.
There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.
"No time, I have business to conduct."
"Unless you intend to bury someone this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler."
Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.
Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.
My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.
Alive.... You're alive... Thank Sithis...
Ssshhh.... Please. There is much... I have to say. And... not much time...
"I'm sorry. So very sorry. The Penitus Oculatus... Maro... He said that by giving you to them, he would leave the Dark Brotherhood alone. Forever."
"By Sithis, I was such a fool. All of this... it's all my fault. You are the best of us, and I nearly killed you... as I've killed everyone else..."
"Yes. I set you up. I wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother, and everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me."
"I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong."
"But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this."
Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
No! Don't pity me. I deserve whatever fate the Dread Lord has in store. I betrayed you... and now Maro has betrayed me. Fitting...
"I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong."
"But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this."
Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
"Don't you see? It was me. I set you up, wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother... everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me."
"I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong."
"But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this."
Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways... they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them.
"And to prove my... sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You lead this Family now. I give you the Blade of Woe, so that you can see it through."
You must kill...
Me.
"Windhelm has been hard on my people. But our fortunes will turn, and we have shelter and food."
Ah. I see.
"Well, then I'll just stay behind you a little bit, and follow along quietly."
"Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I?"
The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.
"The... the books? Oh, I see. I thought perhaps... Well, I thought you'd come for me."
"But yes, the books. The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes."
Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.

Looks like nobody here knows what's happened yet. Come on. Gerdur's probably working in her lumber mill.
Gerdur!
"So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my projects."
How nice to meet you.
Well? What's it going to be?
Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller.
"Now, do you have a reason for making such a mess?"
So you're just one of Aren's lackeys? That's disappointing. You show real promise.
"You come here, kill my assistants, disrupt my work... You've annoyed me, so I don't think I'll be giving you anything."
"Oh, now we're all please and thank you, are we?"
I'm afraid we're well beyond pleasantries.
"I'll allow you the opportunity to turn around, walk out that door, and never come back. I suggest you move quickly."
An arrangement? After you've destroyed so much?
Fine. Leave me the elf. You may go with your books.
I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading.
"Now, you can go back to your College and leave me be, or I can kill you. Your choice."
"Brother! Mara's mercy, you're safe! Your friend told me about Helgen..."
"Brother! Mara's mercy, it's good to see you!"
But is it safe for you to be here? Won't the Imperials be looking for you?
But is it safe for you to be here? We heard that Ulfric had been captured...
"Thanks again for saving my life. I think I'm done with venturing outside of Markarth, though."
"It's an honor to see you, the keeper of Namira's ring."
"Namira watch over you, champion."
You're one of Namira's faithful now.
Did you hear? The Hall of the Dead is closed. Brother Verulus isn't the most popular man in town right now.
They say that something happened in the Hall of the Dead. Brother Verulus has the whole place closed.
Are you hurt? What's happened?
Gerdur...
"Gerdur, I'm fine. At least now I am."
And who's this? One of your comrades?
"Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe him my life, in fact."
"Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe her my life, in fact."
Is there somewhere we can talk? There's no telling when the news from Helgen will reach the Imperials...
You're right. Follow me.
Hod! Come here a minute. I need your help with something.
Ralof! What are you doing here? Ah... I'll be right down.
Stop! That's priceless!
"Please, I don't have anything to pay you with! Don't destroy my urn!"
"If I had it, I'd pay! There's no need to do that!"
No! You're going to break it!
"I can't pay, I can't!"
I can't believe you're doing this! Stop!
He's a rogue mage who defected at the beginning of the war.  I turned him in but apparently he escaped and now this.
Thank you for your help.  Did you see my family inside?
Watch yourself out there. The mercenaries Aringoth hired are trained killers. Just ask our poor little Vex.
The honey they collect on that hunk of rock goes into making Black-Briar Mead; just about the best tasting mead in all of Skyrim.
I wouldn't bother smacking at those hives with a weapon. Set 'em on fire and they'll go up like kindling.
I'd like to know why you're wasting time asking about it when you should already be on your way.
"Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the northwest side of the island."
That's how I slipped in there. Should still be unguarded.

He looks so... sweet. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
Ah yes. I remember your name from the guest list.
"Don't worry, my parties are always well-stocked with the finest food and drink available in this country."
"But first, you were introducing yourself."
"Have you? All good, I trust. But you have me at a disadvantage. I'm afraid I know nothing about you..."
"Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt..."
"What is it, Malborn?"
It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine.
Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...
Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.
"Yes, Madame Ambassador."
"My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy yourself."
"Please, tell me more about yourself. What brings you to this... to Skyrim?"


"Well, we'd better get back to our rounds."
"Oh, it's you. I didn't expect to see you again."
Trying to stay ahead of the Thalmor assassins. I'm not a hero like you. I don't stand a chance.
I count my blessings every day.
"Don't worry, I'm mad at her, too. And at myself for ever agreeing to get involved in her insane scheme."
Trying to stay alive. I think time's running out though. I'm pretty sure the Thalmor know where I am.
"Maybe you can help me. You know, by way of making amends for getting me into this mess."
"You will? Really? Well, okay, here's the situation."
"Sure, fine. Thanks for nothing. You already got what you needed from me."
That's... great news. I'd... I'd better go. Right now. Before they find me again. This is my chance.
Thank you! Here... I stole a lot from the Thalmor over the years. You may as well have some of it.
"I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere, that is."
But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
"I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is."
But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
You'd be saving my life. Again. I know I probably seemed ungrateful... I've just been so scared. Expecting a knife at my throat any minute.
"No, you can't ever be too paranoid where the Thalmor is concerned. Look what happened to the Blades. The Blades!"
"If the damn Blades are no match for the Thalmor, what chance do I have?"
"Please, just go check it out. You'll be saving my life."
"I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is."
But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
"Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today."
"Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today."
Malborn? Ah... very good. I think we understand each other.
Indeed. That would be best.
The Thalmor never forget.
You'll have a traitor's death.
Why struggle? The Thalmor will only send more like me.
A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training.
"It usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father."
"The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... I some ways I still don't."
"I had to for honor's sake, but I had waited too long. My father died before he could see my training to completion."
"When I finally became a priest, they gave me the new high priest's dagger, but I already owned my father's."
"So you see, I have to return it. It breaks tradition, and I need to tell him that I finally did what he wanted."
She finally decided to return it to her father. Bless her heart.
"I will make sure this finds its way to his tomb as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it, my child."
"Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul. Good. I was getting... hungry."
Wait. There's something different about you.
This is my realm. I won't let you take it from me!
Azura. Mother of Roses. Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Your chosen champion has returned your Star to you.
"She wishes to speak to you herself. Please. Place your hands on the altar, and you will hear her voice."
"While you were in the Star, Azura gave me a vision. Her last, she said."
I have never been without Azura's foresight since escaping Morrowind. I don't know what to do.
"If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you, Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose."
"Leave this shrine, blasphemer, before I kill you for defiling Azura's artifact."
"Twilight watch over you, guardian."
"I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith. Afterwards, her magic sustained me."
I could easily provide my spells to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.
"Until next time, guardian."
"It's been an honor, guardian."
"No. She said my part was over. That my fate had moved beyond the Twilight, and I was on my own."
"I will tend Azura's shrine when you do not need me. I still have my duties, but for the first time I feel... alone."
"Oh, the Listener, well... listens! The Night Mother speaks to you. Guides you on your path."
"But when the Night Mother speaks, the Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis. And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate."
Oh... Well... yes. I did. I did indeed. I tried to listen. Tried so hard. But the Night Mother never spoke to poor Cicero.
The silence became almost... maddening.
"Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure! Cicero will remain the happy Keeper."
Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg!
Wait... the Listener is serious? Oh.
"Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again! She might speak now, or later, or... I don't know! But speak she will!"
The Night Mother is part of you now! You get to hear voices inside your head! The rest of us should be so lucky.

The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage.
"On moonlit nights or in darkened rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible."
The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgement of those around him.
"By weaving the darkness to their will, this agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time."
"This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them."
"At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger."
"Good luck, Nightingale."
Choose your path and your journey will be complete.
"We're not done talking. You fell for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - didn't you? I won't let her have you!"
"Okay, let's all take a deep breath. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Please tell me this is some kind of sick joke."
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Please tell me you haven't. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother... but she spoke to you?
More souls are needed for the Star. The last one died before he could be harvested.
We can't take another villager from the surface so soon. I told you to prepare everything properly!
We can just sacrifice another disciple. Apprentice Haerlon will be no great waste.
Yes. He'll do.
There's a cave here. Perfect hideout for bandits or worse.
Another filthy cave. Always so dark.
Hmm. Caves. Wonder what's below.
"Hey look, a cave. Wonder what's inside?"
"Look, a cave. An exciting place to venture, if you know what you're doing."
There's a cave here. Bears if we're lucky. Trolls if we're not.
"Look at that, a cave. Who knows what could be down there?"
"Look, a cave. A fine place to find trouble."
A cave. Dark. Dangerous.
There's a cave. Tread carefully.
"Hey, there's a cave. Bad place to stumble drunk."
There's a cave here. Think we should check it out?
We've found a cave. I don't think there are warm fires and friendly faces inside.
"There's a cave. Animals or bandits inside, no doubt."
A cave. Up for some hunting?
Cave up ahead. Trouble or maybe treasure?
It's a Nordic ruin. Thousands of years old.
Look. Nordic ruins. I hope there's gold inside.
Nordic ruins. Old. Secretive.
Is that one of the old ruins?
"Oh, look. A Nordic ruin."
"Old ruins. Nordic, I think."
"My word, look at those ruins. Remarkable."
"Look at those ruins. How long have they stood here, I wonder?"
"Old stonework. Gold, traps, and bones."
Nord stonework. Thousands of years old.
Look at those old stones. Ancient Nords sure could build.
Look at those ruins. Think there's gold inside?
The old Nords sure did love their stonework.
"Look at these stones. The ancestors knew how to build, no doubt."
Ruins ahead. Means old traps and bonewalkers.
Look. One of the ancient Nord ruins. Who knows what's down there?
The entrance to a dwarven city. All manner of strange traps and machines will be inside.
Is this that dwarven city? I hear the treasure from their ruins is worth a fortune.
Dwemer ruins. The people under the mountains. All gone now.
Look over there. That's a dwarven ruin.
A dwarven city. A place of mystery and death.
Dwarven metalwork. So much wasted effort.
"Oh, look. It's the entrance to a dwarven city. I've heard stories...."
I dislike lurking near dwarven cities. It's like their ghosts are watching us.
Huh. Dwarven ruins. Strange places.
A Dwemer city. The lost people. The heretics.
"Is that a dwarven city? I've never seen a dwarf, ever. Don't think anyone has."
"Seems like a ruin. Dwarven, I think?"
"By the Mane, look. A dwarven city. Still sitting here after thousands of years."
Get nervous around dwarven stonework. Legends say these cities are haunted.
Old dwarven ruin. Look at that metalwork. Such a waste.
That's a dwarven city. I hear they built armor that walks like people.
Don't see that every day.
"I've seen better. Well, maybe not."
Damn. That's quite a sight.
I've never seen anything quite like that.
What a sight....
Mighty impressive.
Wow! That's impressive.
"By the Hist, what a sight...."
That's...that's...wow.
Impressive. Damn impressive.
Look at that. Am I drunk? I must be drunk.
Wow. Would you look at that.
By the Twin Moons...
By Ysmir! That's impressive.
"Gotta admit, that's impressive."
By the Nine!
Get ready. Trouble ahead.
Yuck. Something smells.
Trouble is in the air here.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I smell blood.
Keep your blade ready.
I don't like where this is going.
I have a feeling there's going to be trouble.
Get ready for a fight.
Keep your eyes open.
Get a bad feeling.
Don't like the looks of this.
Something smells foul.
Got a feeling there's trouble ahead.
Smell that? Blood.
I don't think I like where this is going.
Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire island.
"In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should talk to her about it before you go."
We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing.
"If the workers had a dispute, we'd rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments."
"In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout."
"Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business."
"Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business."
"Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd be calling on the Dark Brotherhood."
It's just business.
"The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours."
Now we'll see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.
"I know you, Ulfric. If I hand over Markarth, you'll be ready with a new demand."
"You're losing this war, and you know it."
"You'll never defeat the Empire, and you know it. But you're willing to sacrifice thousands for your own selfish ambition."
Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed your oath to the Emperor at every turn.
You... you disappointed me. You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.
I'm sure that will be comforting to your comrades that gave their lives for the territory you just handed to Ulfric.
You should think harder on your oath to the Emperor next time you're deciding what's right.
You made your decision. Now live with it.
You are hereby dishonorably dismissed and removed from the rolls of the Imperial Legion.
I'm sorry. Good luck.
"Legate, with me. We have a lot of work to do."
"This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And Jarl Ulfric. Markarth is ours!"
"Giving up Riften is a heavy price to pay for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it."
"I admit, I really didn't expect these talks to succeed. Getting the Empire to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement."
"Jarl Vignar, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?"
"Yes, I'm ready to do my part."
"By Talos, that's an excellent question. I hope you haven't forgotten that little detail?"
"Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap."
"Shout for Odahviing from the Dragonsreach courtyard. After that, it's up to you."
Interesting problem. Hmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here in Sky Haven Temple.
"Fair? This is war, soldier. War's about winning, not being fair to the enemy."
"The Empire showed its true colors today, eh? Don't worry. I was once loyal to the Empire, too, before my eyes were opened."
"Come see me in Windhelm when all this is over, and I'll find a place for you."
"I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true son of Skyrim here today."
"I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true daughter of Skyrim here today."
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought your eyes had finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
"Welcome, brother! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature."
"Welcome, sister! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature."
"Pay no attention to him. A ponderous windbag, like most Imperial generals."
"Now, back to the matter at hand."
I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.
Fine then.  The blood of my family is on your hands as well as Brurid's.
"I wish we could offer more help, but our last attack went sour and we're all that is left."
Good luck.
Hey. You wanna play a game?
Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor.
"Oh, I have the utmost faith in your success, believe me. So let's begin."
"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
"You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily."
"Yes. For Sithis... and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time."
"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
"You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily."
Hmph. Look at you. So calm. So confident. I do believe you were born for this task. So let's begin.
"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
"You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily."
"Here, take this - it's called Jarrin Root."
"All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead."
"Once Mede has been killed, escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've [QUOTE]arranged[QUOTE] for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded."
"Now go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener."
"It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be served like any vegetable - cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled in a stew."
"One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even think about it."
Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.
Gianna will be overjoyed to meet you. She's in the kitchens.
What's this now?
...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]...
By Azura. The Gourmet!
I... I'm sorry! Your clothes... of course... I should have realized!
"Please, excuse my ignorance.  Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival. You should proceed to the kitchens straight away."
What's this now?
...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]...
By Azura. The Gourmet!
"I... I'm sorry! I didn't realize! We... we had no idea who to expect, you understand. You're not dressed as I would have suspected..."
"But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival."
The Gourmet. This is such an honor.
The misses and I love your strawberry tarts.
"Hmmm, the Potage le Magnifique. Smells delicious."
"Please, carry on."
"Move along, citizen."
"Just go right into the tower, then straight ahead to the kitchen. Gianna's expecting you."
"Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put whatever you have over there, then get out!"
"We'll begin as soon as you're wearing the hat. Check the shelf over there. Wouldn't want the Emperor mistaking you for someone else, now would we."
"Oh, just look at you. Absolutely brilliant. Now... now you're just as I imagined."
The Emperor is going to love it. How can he not?
"Keep it together, Gianna. Keep it together..."
"Maybe when this is all over, you could sign one of your cookbooks for me?"
I'm so nervous.
The... Gourmet?
"Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it."
It's just...
"Well, I don't mean to seem disappointed, but... I just never figured the Gourmet was an Imperial. I had dreamed of something more exotic, maybe..."
"Well, I'm just surprised the Gourmet is a Redguard. I had you pegged for a Wood Elf, honestly. You know, because of your use of..."
You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less...
"Well, I just never expected the Gourmet to be a Breton. It almost seems too obvious. Some of the greatest cooks have been Bretons, and..."
"It's just... Well... you're an Orc! Ha ha ha! If the people of the Empire only knew! I mean, now I understand your need for secrecy. Most would..."
You're a High Elf! I... I never would have guessed it. So many of your recipes are clearly aimed at the commonfolk. It just seems...
"I guessed right! I... I always imagined the great Gourmet was a Wood Elf. You see, only someone with a knowledge of woodland herbs could combine..."
"I... Well, I just can't believe the Gourmet is a Dark Elf. How difficult it must have been for you in Morrowind. The food there is..."
You... you're an Argonian! Where did you learn to cook like that? Surely not in Black Marsh. Why even the...
"Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem."
The Emperor has requested your signature dish - the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started.
"But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it... the Gourmet's special way."
The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now. So... which ingredient should I add next?
"Oh. Well, um, actually... you're not. Wearing a chef's hat, I mean. There's one right over there on the shelf. You can't very well cook without it..."
Carrots? Really? Okay...
What next?
Ooohh.... how decadent. I never would have guessed it.
What next?
"Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique."
"Well then, I think  a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right?"
Now what?
"Maybe we should start over, hmm? We want the Gourmet's famous Potage le Magnifique to be perfect, after all."
"So, what is the first special ingredient?"
Vampire dust? Seriously?
"Hmm... yes. I guess I can see how that would add a more... earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand..."
"All right. What next, then?"
"Ah, of course. I suspected as much."
"My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor."
A... giant's toe? You're... sure about that?
"Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea."
Okay. Now what?
"Ooookay.... Um.... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two..."
A Septim? As in... a gold coin? Really?
"Ah, I see now. That would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic - but delicious - aftertaste. Simply brilliant."
"I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?"
"Hmmm... horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of..."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat."
"I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?"
"My choice, hmm? All right, then - tomatoes. Simple, yet infinitely flavorful. Don't you agree?"
"Well, I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?"
Of course! I.... I'm sorry. One giant's toe. There.
"What, um... What next?"
"Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might..."
Excellent. They should be ready for us now.
"And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire."
"I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you."
"Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all."
"All right then, your secret ingredient's been added."
"And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire."
"I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you."
Really? All right! You pick. Tag or hide-and-seek?
Figures. You elders are always so boring.
Okay. You're it!
I know all the good spots! You don't stand a chance!
You stand right there and count to 10. No peaking. Ready? Okay go!

"You surrender Hjaalmarch to us, and take Idgrod Ravencrone with you. Sorli the Builder will take over as Jarl of Morthal."
"You surrender Falkreath to us. Siddgeir steps down, and Dengeir of Stuhn resumes the Jarlship."
"You withdraw from the Pale, and allow Jarl Skald the Elder to return to Dawnstar."
"We want Imperial forces to withdraw from Winterhold, and allow Jarl Kraldar to return from exile."
Bah! This is a waste of time. I can see that we won't get better terms from this council.
So be it. The sons of Skyrim at least put the greater good above our own interests.
"If we're not going to get Markarth, we need you to give us something."
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Riften on these terms.
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are still not acceptable.
These terms are not acceptable. You know that.
"Come on, Tullius. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both."
I'm sure you have something in mind.
I'm listening.
Let's hear it.
"So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards by using this council to advance your own position?"
"General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously! I thought we were here to discuss a truce!"
"Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this."
Elisif! I said I'd handle it.
"What makes you think I'll give that to you, if I wouldn't give you Markarth?"
"Where do these demands stop, Ulfric? Do you expect me to surrender all of Skyrim?"
You treat us fairly. Thank you.
Spoken like a true son of Skyrim!
Spoken like a true daughter of Skyrim!
What? And you call yourself a son of Skyrim?
What? And you call yourself a daughter of Skyrim?
Even the Dragonborn betrays Skyrim.
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn be the judge of the fairness of my request.
It seems I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
Jarl Ulfric...
General Tullius...
You both agree to this?
These terms blatantly favor the rebels. Everyone here knows that.
"But the Empire will accept them, until the dragon menace is dealt with."
"The Empire can live with these terms, yes. For a temporary truce, until the dragon menace is dealt with."
"I shouldn't agree to terms that so blatantly favor the Empire. I have no choice, though, under the circumstances."
But once Alduin is defeated - then it will be the Empire's turn. Remember - [QUOTE]Evgir Unslaad.[QUOTE]
The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the Imperials hold to theirs.
These are the terms currently on the table.
"Markarth remains allied to the Empire, under the authority of Jarl Igmund."
"Riften remains allied to the Stormcloak cause, under the authority of Jarl Laila Law-Giver."
"Markarth will be handed over to Ulfric's forces. Jarl Igmund will step down, and Thongvor Silver-Blood will become the Jarl of Markarth."
"Riften will be handed over to Imperial control. Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften."
"The Stormcloaks will withdraw from Hjaalmarch, and Idgrod Ravencrone will resume the Jarlship."
"Falkreath will be returned to Imperial control, under the authority of Jarl Siddgeir."
The Pale will be turned over to the Empire. Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship in Dawnstar.
"Winterhold will be turned over to the Empire, although the College itself will retain its traditional neutrality."
"Hjaalmarch will be turned over to Ulfric, with Sorli the Builder assuming the Jarlship."
"Falkreath will be turned over to Ulfric, and Dengeir of Stuhn will return as Jarl."
"Imperial forces will withdraw from The Pale, and Jarl Skald the Elder will be allowed to return to Dawnstar."
"Imperial troops will withdraw from Winterhold, and Kraldar will return as Jarl."
"The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Reach, allowing Jarl Igmund to return to Markarth."
"The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Rift, allowing Imperial troops unhindered access."
"Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften."
"The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Reach, allowing Ulfric's forces unhindered access to Markarth."
"Jarl Igmund will go into exile, with Thongvor Silver-Blood taking his place as Jarl of Markarth."
"The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Rift, allowing the return of Jarl Laila Law-Giver."
"Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Hjaalmarch, allowing Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone to return to Morthal."
"Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Falkreath, allowing Jarl Siddgeir to return."
"Ulfric will allow Imperial forces into the Pale. Skald the Elder will go into exile, and Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship."
Ulfric will allow Imperial troops to enter Winterhold. Korir will replace Kraldar as Jarl.
"The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Hjaalmarch. Idgrod Ravencrone will go into exile, with Sorli the Builder replacing her as Jarl."
"The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Falkreath. Jarl Siddgeir will step down, and Dengeir of Stuhn will take his place as Jarl."
"The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Pale, allowing Jarl Skald the Elder to return from exile."
"The Empire will withdraw its troops from Winterhold, allowing Jarl Korir to return from exile."
But I at least will negotiate in good faith.
"Do you hear that, Tullius? The blood of the innocent cries out for weregild."
"And so the Empire runs roughshod over Skyrim, as usual."
Markarth is off the table. Your rabble is on the verge of defeat. We have no need of a truce at such a price.
"We've made you a fair offer. Are you serious about these talks, or are you just here to posture?"
"You always were a fool, Ulfric. You'll never get a better chance to salvage something from the ruins of your ambition."
Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty disagreements?
Here you sit arguing about... nothing! While the fate of the land hangs in the balance!
"Is he with you, Delphine? If so, I advise you to tell him to watch his tongue."
He is with me.
"And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say, before you do anything rash."
Don't you understand the danger? Don't you understand what the return of the dragons means?
"Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now, he devours the souls of your fallen comrades!"
He grows more powerful with every soldier slain in your pointless war!
Can you not put aside your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger?
"A very pretty speech, but what does it have to do with..."
Shut up.
"If he's right about Alduin... we both have just as much to lose here, Tullius, remember that."
That's enough out of you.
"I don't know about the end of the world, but this dragon situation has gotten out of hand."
"If this truce will help the Dragonborn here put an end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric."
"I think you're on the wrong side in this war, my friend."
Yes!
"You slaughtered them - the women, the children! You butchers!"
"That's a lie! My legionnaires are disciplined, unlike your..."
"You don't really expect compensation every time a farm gets burned in a war that you started, do you Ulfric?"
Think carefully where your loyalties lie... brother.
Think carefully where your loyalties lie... sister.
I don't know why I expected even-handed treatment from you.
"In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly."
"Riften seems like a better choice to me. Well-fortified, easily resupplied across Lake Honrich. Plus all the mead we can drink."
"In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly. I might rather consider Whiterun."
I've never liked having the rebels right on Solitude's doorstep. Retaking Hjaalmarch would help secure our supply lines...
Regaining Pale Pass would help our supply situation considerably... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath...
Having another port would ease our supply situation considerably...
Winterhold would allow us to directly threaten the rebel supply lines out of Windhelm...
"I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, despite your known Imperial sympathies."
"You're different from what I expected, Dragonborn. You treat us with respect, despite your known Imperial sympathies."
"Think hard about your loyalties, brother. I expected better from you."
"I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and now it seems you help the Empire at every turn."
"Think hard about your loyalties, sister. I expected better from you."
"Well done, brother. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement."
"Well done, sister. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement."
You've dealt with us fairly so far. You've heard our demand. What say you?
"What say you, Dragonborn?"
"Now that that's settled, may we proceed?"
Who would like to open the negotiations?
This council is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request.
"I ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim."
Jarl Ulfric.
General Tullius.
Are we ready to proceed?
But the difficulty remains - how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at all?
Hjaalmarch would allow us to directly threaten the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...
Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath.
Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and would leave Whiterun dangerously exposed...
Hmm... the Empire is bringing in a lot of supplies through Dawnstar. Taking the Pale would stretch them pretty thin...
I've never liked having the Imperials right on Windhelm's doorstep. Retaking Winterhold would help secure our supply lines...
"I expected better of you, Dragonborn. You swore an oath to serve the Emperor. Don't forget it."
"I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad situation."
"You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation to this council, despite your known association with the rebels."
But it seems you have no intention of dealing fairly with me.
"You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation on trust in your good name. But it seems you intend to favor Ulfric."
"I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You treated us fairly despite your known rebel sympathies."
But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
"If you think this war is nearly won, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor."
You can trample us underfoot but we will rise again!
"If you think you can hold Markarth, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor."
"If you think we'll just hand over Riften, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor."
"Soon enough I'll have you back under the headsman's axe, and this time there won't be any dragon to save you."
"As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!"
"You heard the man, Ulfric."
"You heard what she said, Ulfric."
"You did the best you could, brother. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point."
"You did the best you could, Dragonborn. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point."
"You did the best you could, sister. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point."
"As for you, General Tullius, I see now that Galmar was right. Talking to the Empire is just as useless as ever."
Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire!
"Let's go, Galmar. I should have listened to you in the first place."
"You always were a fool, Ulfric. You're no better at diplomacy than you are on the battlefield."
You've been even-handed so far. What do you say to our demand?
"So, Dragonborn. What do you say?"
Ah. I believe I can be of help here.
That's what comes of trying to win a war with a bare handful of legions. If the Emperor would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!
Take your seat and we can begin.
"We all wait upon you, Dragonborn."
"Why delay? Please, take your seat so we can begin."
Fair enough. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
"Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still..."
I did ask. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
"Fair enough. I thought you might be able to see past your Imperial loyalties in the interests of peace, but I guess not. Still..."
"Fair enough. You claim to be neutral, but it seems that you actually favor the Empire. Still..."
"Not enough to outweigh the loss of Markarth. With the Reach in enemy hands, our whole position in Solitude would be threatened."
I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.
Well. You surprise me. I was expecting you to favor Ulfric. Maybe this council will achieve something after all.
"Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth without a fight."
"Better than nothing, I guess. But Tullius will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Riften without a fight."
"I found you! Na na na, na na na!"
There you are!
Found you!
"10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Prepared or not, I'm coming!"
He he he.
Shhh!
He'll never find me here.
She'll never find me here.
This is a good hiding spot.
Argh! You found me!
You got me.
My turn!
You've proven reliable. There's a group of bandits in my Hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with.
"The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. Go and take care of it."
"Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear."
"I can fashion whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here before you."
A blade! It will be as sharp as Fralia's tongue!
"Ah, the sneaky type, eh? I think we can fix you right up."
Just like Ysgramor himself.
Sure you can handle that? Ha! Of course you can.
"Now that's a smart weapon. Light, strong, useful. Crack some skulls for me."
"Speak with Miss Salma, if you wish to speak."
"I grow tired of debating this. If Miss Salma insists on this folly, so be it."
"I admit, there is strength in numbers. Perhaps between us..."
"We should be inside, loading up on treasure. Worry-scales here thinks we should wait, though. Don't get any ideas, either. We were here first."
I don't care what Beem says. It's high time we get in there and find our fortune.
"Gold, silver. Gems, maybe? Only one way to find out!"
"Not without us, you aren't! I'm sure there's enough for everyone, after all."
"Come on, Beem-Ja. We're going."
"Hardly worth giving up Markarth for, but not a bad starting point."
"Not quite worth handing over Riften, but not a bad starting point."
Just round up the rest of the magical artifacts so that I can catalog them.
"Finally, reinforcements have arrived."
"I was expecting more though, you'd better be good."
"I didn't want to, but she attacked to try and keep me from leaving."
"I just can't be a part of this place any more! The things we do here - evil, evil things. No more!"
"I called it home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the Hagravens that live here. So was she."
"I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing."
He what?
What?
"You must be one of the new apprentices, then? Fine, fine. Just... just don't make a mess of my work, all right?"
"Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work."
"I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here."
"Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything."
"Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory."
Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor!
Unlike your Imperial friends here.
"You're lucky I respect the Greybeards' council, Galmar!"
Legate. We represent the Emperor here.
"Sorry, sir. It won't happen again."
No. We'll stay. Out of respect for the Dragonborn and our Greybeard hosts.
"We walk, then."
"But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her, is that clear?"
"Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that's burning your farms and killing your sons."
She's supposed to be on our side?
You know exactly... no. Not this time.
"Yes, let's get down to it."
"Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us to give up Markarth at the negotiating table."
I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing.
"You hope to gain in council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it?"
We've taken it before. I'm only asking for what will be ours soon enough anyway.
"Yes, that'd be entirely out of character."
What would the Empire want in return?
"Wait. General, you don't intend to just hand over Markarth to that... traitor!"
"You lost the trust of the people of Skyrim, Elisif. You had your chance to make the right choice when the war started."
Enough!
"First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think it's a waste of time."
"You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a traitor's death."
"Since we're all here at your request, I'd like to hear what you think Markarth is worth."
"This council was your idea, eh? So tell us, what do you think Riften is worth?"
Damn right.
Just what I was thinking.
Hmm. The Rift would help secure our communications with Cyrodiil... and threaten Ulfric's southern flank...
It's true that Whiterun is dangerously exposed as long as the Stormcloaks hold Markarth...
You're right. Ulfric isn't in any position to ask for Markarth.
Good. Follow me. We have to fight our way up. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.
Then I must do this alone.
By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain...
At last.
I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will.
"The child is spirited, but lacks... agency."

"I've seen enough to know their fabric. The warp of air, the weft of time."
"But no, it is not in my possession."
The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him.
"He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure."
"In time, he brought me here. To the box."
But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.
The Greybeards? What do those old hermits want with me?
Why? There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms against his rightful Emperor.
"Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the moment, but we're already overstretched."
"No, you're right. After all this time, Ulfric still holds almost half of Skyrim."
Well... we could use some breathing space to regroup. Things haven't been going well for us lately.
Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses.
"From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes."
"Yes. Yes, fine, I'll come to this Greybeard council. For all the good it will do."
What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!
Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.
We're ready when you are.
"You do have a plan for luring a dragon here, yeah?"
Go ahead and call this dragon of yours. We're ready.
What are you waiting for? Let's get this over with.
Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling?
"I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!"
Got him!
I think it's holding!
Nid!
No!
Horvutah med kodaav. Caught like a bear in a trap...
"Zok frini grind ko grah drun viiki, Dovahkiin."
Ah. I forget. You do not have the dovah speech.
"My... eagerness to meet you in battle was my... undoing, Dovahkiin. I salute your, hmm, low cunning in devising such a grahmindol - strategem."
Zu'u bonaar. You went to a great deal of trouble to put me in this... humiliating position.
"Hind siiv Alduin, hmm? No doubt you want to know where to find Alduin?"
Rinik vazah. An apt phrase. Alduin bovul. One reason I came to your call was to test your Thu'um for myself.
"Many of us have begun to question Alduin's lordship, whether his Thu'um was truly the strongest."
"Among ourselves, of course. Mu ni meyye. None were yet ready to openly defy him."
Unslaad krosis. Innumerable pardons. I digress.
"He has travelled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor... the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards..."
"His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains."
"Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til. I surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is marshalled there."
"Zu'u lost ofan hin laan... now that I have answered your question, you will allow me to go free?"
"Aam? Serve you? ...no. Ni tiid. If and when you defeat Alduin, I will reconsider."
Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
"I anticipated the problem. While you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky Haven Temple."
"Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of Power -- Shouts."
"By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be."
"He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge."
"Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin."
I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.
"Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll."
"Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice, but it is written here in this scroll."
So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet.
And now Titus Mede II is as good as dead.
Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect me too.
As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself slipping away.
"Even right this moment, I feel strange... when I don't think I should be feeling anything at all."
"The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck."
"Whatever it is, I'm sure I can't be of help. I'm just here on... holiday."
"Please, just let me be..."
Gourmet? Why I... Um...
"Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?"
What? The Emperor? But I...
"Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't do this. You can't!"
"Yes, well. Perhaps the proprietor of this establishment can assist you. Please, you're starting to... frighten me."
"Yes, well. Perhaps someone else in the village can assist you? Please, you're starting to... frighten me."
"Come now, you've got your orders. What else could you possibly need?"
"[QUOTE]Uncommon Taste.[QUOTE] It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight."
The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent.
"I've made a few of the Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard berry sauce is to die for."
But his chocolate pate gives me the runs.
"Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef."
"But the Emperor canceled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed."
"And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim... on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that."
"Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and you've already taken care of him."
I do know the Gourmet was classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So that's where he must have met Anton Virane.
"In any event, our anonymous chef shares a passion for food with all of Tamriel. And that anonymity will prove the Emperor's undoing."
Get me out of here!
"Hey, over here!"
"Don't leave me, for Arkay's sake!"
Help me! Help!
Help me out of here!
Get me down. Get me down!
"Ah, kill it. Kill it!"
Get it away from me. Get it away!
Don't let it get me. Help!
Agh. Agh!
Keep it away from me!
Is it over?
Is it dead?
Is it safe now?
You'll never get the claw!
Too slow!
"You found it? Ha ha ha. There it is. Strange... it seems smaller than I remember. Funny thing, huh?"
I'm going to put this back where it belongs. I'll never forget this. You've done a great thing for me and my sister.
Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Camilla.
Thanks. I only wish Camilla was here to see it.
"Here, take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader."
Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Lucan.
Thanks. I only wish Lucan was here to see this again.
Take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.
"Now that it's upon us, I'm rather looking forward to the challenge. I'll be famouser than Olaf One-Eye!"
My men know what to do. Make sure you do your part. I'm putting my city in your hands.
"Careful, there's a pressure plate around here. I've triggered it before and got pelted with darts."
Hey! Those belong to my family!
"Sigh... fine, take whatever you want, so long as you help me get rid of Vals."
"Okay, I think this door should lead to the main burial chamber where Vals is holed up. Let's get in there and put and end to this."
"Only Paarthurnax, the master of our order, can answer that question, if he so chooses."
"To get the answers you seek, you must travel to the top of the mountain and speak to our master, Paarthurnax."
You weren't ready. You still aren't ready.
"But thanks to the Blades, you now have questions that only Paarthurnax can answer."
He lives in seclusion on the very peak of the mountain.
"He speaks to us only rarely, and never to outsiders. Being allowed to see him is a great privilege."
Only those whose Voice is strong can find the path. Come. We will teach you a Shout to open the way to Paarthurnax.
"By Sithis, help me!"
"No... No, this cannot be..."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. It's all right. You've been through a lot. Maybe you should just sit down for a bit..."
"I'm with you, Listener."
"Astrid did the right thing, and now it's your turn. End her suffering."
"By Sithis, what... what happened?"
Nazir told me what happened in Solitude. You poor dear. You've been through so much...
"Oh, Astrid..."
"Astrid... By the sands, I still can't wrap my head around it..."
"If I hadn't heard it with my own ears I wouldn't have believed it. How could Astrid have done this to us? Strangely, I feel only pity for her..."
I owe Thorald my life. Helping to save him is the least I can do.
No one should ever be left to the Thalmor.
The Thalmor need to be taught a lesson.
I pledged to aid Avulstein and Thorald a long time ago. There's nothing that could keep me from helping them now.
I must be on my way now.
"I owe you my life, friend."
Keep going! We need to get farther away from here!
"Let's get out of here, fast as we can!"
You there! What are you doing?
"We're getting Thorald back, no matter what."
Do you have news? Did you find something?
Please tell me you have news of my son.
"Please, let's speak privately."
"Please, anything you can do to help find my Thorald..."
If only you could help bring my son back to me.
Thorald's disappearance has left our family in shambles.
"Please, stop! I'll pay! Take it!"
"Please, no more. I'll pay, I'll pay. Here!"
Here... take your damn coin and get out of here!
"Well fought, ya swinging bit of skeever bait."
I don't believe it. I guess you were right!
Your fists speak louder than your words.
"You bested me, an Orc chief. Impressive."
It's been so long since I tasted my own blood. Sour.
Damn addicts always stealing from me.
Damn it. Why'd you have to walk into Morthal?
Now that's what I call a punch. You got me.
Now that was a punch.
"Wait, I can still fight. No, no I can't."
That wasn't a fair swing.
Damn outsider. Why couldn't you just mind your own business?
Backbiter.
Damn boot-lover.
You throw a mean hook.
What was that? Some kind of foreign move?
"You know how to throw a punch, I'll give you that."
Ugh. You mangy piece of pit-bait.
Not at all. It's good to be put in your place once in a while.
I guess I shouldn't boast so much... it gets expensive!
You're no liar. Best fight I've had in years. There you are.
"You ever need another blade at your side, just ask. Wouldn't mind seeing how you handle a few trolls."
You're a real fighter. I like that.
"You ever need my steel by your side, you just ask."
"My axe is yours, outlander. Just say the word."
That you have. Here.
Fair fight. Here you are.
Fine. The hilt is in a chest inside my house.  Here are the keys. Take that damn thing and go.
Yeah. Here.
"Yeah, yeah. Go on in."
Here. I hope you choke on it.
"You win. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me ever again."
I get your point. Tell Iddra I'm sorry for being so stubborn about the coin.
"You got me, fair and square. Tell Haran I'll pay."
"I yield. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, the Argonians will be paid as much as any other worker."
I was sent by Nepos the Nose. The old man hands out the orders.
"He told me to make sure you didn't get in the way. That's all I know, I swear!"
All right. Tell the old man his debts are settled.
All right. I'll lay off him. Just leave.
"Fine! I'll take care of it, just please leave me alone!"
"Get it over with, then."
You're making a mistake!
"Wait a moment, you're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even our little Vex couldn't get in."
"You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let him prove it."
"You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let her prove it."
Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one of our largest clients.
"However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands and shut us out. He needs to be taught a lesson."
Brynjolf will provide you with the details.
"Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?"
"Hmm? Oh, yes."
"Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild."
The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
"Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients."








We are the rightful rulers of Markarth!
Death to the Nords!
Glory to the Forsworn!
You have stepped on us long enough!
I bleed for the people of the Reach!
The old gods give me strength!
I die for my people.
I inherited the store from my husband. His father was Arnleif.
"My husband, Gunnar, died about five years ago. Forsworn attack. I miss that stubborn oaf."
Thank you. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for you when you return.
Sorry to hear that.
No. As if trade wasn't poor enough. Now there's violence in the streets.
"It was the Forsworn, wasn't it? I lose dozens of shipments every season to those barbarians. Now they're in the city? Gods help us."
Hear that?
"Shor's bones, here he comes!"
You better know what you're doing!
"Steady! Steady, now! Keep under cover until it's down!"
"That's it! Now, wait until he's well inside!"
Now! Quickly!

"Aerin, have you seen my ring? The one with the inscription?"
"No, I haven't. Don't tell me you've lost it."
I hope not. That ring is irreplaceable.
"I'll look around the house and if I find it, I'll bring it to you right away."
"Well, you were right. These so called 'Gutter Saints' live in the sewers beneath."
I suspected as much. The real question now is do we do something about it ourselves or do we speak to the Jarl?
"I say we go down there and clear the place out, just like old times."
"No, my friend. That would be reckless. We have to help, but help in a way that doesn't directly place anyone in harm's way."
"For now, give this [QUOTE]Ratway[QUOTE] a wide berth."
Dirge! Did you take out the trash like I asked?
Yeah. Threw it in the lake like you said.
Tell me you looked through the trash before you did that.
"Take it easy, Vekel. How long we known each other? Yeah. I checked it. All the stuff is in the safe."
"Job's done, boss. Gave the package to her just you said."
Good. Did she say anything we need to know?
"Yep. She said that the Jarl was planning a surprise raid on us, but she talked her out of it. Said she saved us a lot of trouble."
That she did. Very good. I'll tell Brynjolf.
"Decided to show up for work today, eh?"
And just what's that supposed to mean?
"It means I have a business to run, I need to have the books straight and you're barely ever here!"
"For goodness sake, Bolli! You barely lift a finger yourself when you're here except to point at things for your workers to do."
"Let them do the work, that's what you pay them for!"
Sigh.
"Bolli, I was looking at the finances and I noticed you've been donating gold to the Temple of Mara. Are you out of your mind?"
Maramal's been helping me through a rough patch. I just wanted to pay him back. It's not like he's keeping it!
"Uh huh. I'm sure he runs outside with the coin and throws it up in the air so Mara herself can catch it. Come off of it, Bolli."
"You may be my wife, but this is my business, so just do your job. Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of gold left over to waste on trinkets."
"Wujeeta, we need to talk."
"I know, I was late. I'm sorry."
I don't know what I'm going to do with you. I can't just let this go unpunished.
"Please, don't get rid of me! I need the coin. I... I'll work for free for the rest of this week. Please!"
Sigh. Very well. You're lucky Maramal has placed me in a very forgiving mood.
"Wujeeta, you can't keep showing up here late. Bolli's just going to get someone to replace you."
"No, no, no. I need this job! This is the last place in town to have work."
There's always the Thieves Guild.
What was that?
"Nothing, nothing. Just straighten yourself out before you find yourself headed back to Black Marsh."
Maven! Always a pleasure to receive you. What can I help you with today?
"Thank you, Laila. I wanted to discuss the protection of my shipments."
I'm certain you're aware of the loss I sustained a fortnight ago.
"Yes, indeed. An entire caravan shipment of your mead taken by Imperial soldiers. What of it?"
"Well, I'm also certain you're aware that our own city guard failed to provide the protection required to ensure safe passage of the shipment."
Indeed. We lost three soldiers in that attack. A sad day for Riften.
"Quite. To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it."
"I have payments to make you realize. If I can't make them, I can't make Black-Briar Mead."
We... don't have enough to...
"Laila, Riften is my home, but if my meadery can't be safe here, I'll just move it elsewhere."
"No, that won't be necessary. You'll have compensation for your loss."
"Thank you, Laila."
Hafjorg! Where did you put it woman?!
"Sigh. What is it now, dear?"
Don't you [QUOTE]dear[QUOTE] me! I had a bowl of Vampire Dust on my worktable not an hour ago and after you swept in there it's gone!
"Oh my. Elgrim, it's on the shelf to the right of the table, as always."
"Ah, I see. Well, just be careful around my things!"
"Elgrim, honey. I'm concerned about your new pupil. She seems very... odd."
Ingun? She's brilliant; a natural!
"Oh dear, I didn't mean to say she isn't bright."
"It's the things she makes here, the things she says and all those poor little animals she tests them on. It's just not right."
"Damn it, woman! Ingun is the most promising alchemist I've ever seen and I won't have you scaring her off!"
"So, Talen. Have you reconsidered my offer?"
"Sorry Hemming, I've no interest in becoming your valet."
"What's the matter, I thought you people were used to indentured servitude."
"Xhuth! Black-Briar or not, say that again and so help me you're going to need more than your mother to protect you from me."
Talen! Another round!
"I think you've had plenty, Vulwulf. Maybe you should head on home."
"You stupid lizard! I said give me some more drink, or I'll have your head on a pike!"
Suit yourself.
"Have I told you about Valen, my dear?"
I love when you spin that yarn. Gets better every time you add something new.
He killed six Imperial Guards before they dragged him into the prisons.
"Was this before or after the Mythic Dawn attacked the Emperor and Valen single-handedly fought them off? Just shut up and drink, Romlyn."
Ungrien! I just found another spoiled keg! What's the matter with you?
I... I'm sorry. I could have sworn I sealed it.
Tell me something. Do you enjoy spending Lady Maven's gold for her? It certainly seems that way.
No.
"This is the last warning. You do it again, and you'll be sleeping in Beggar's Row with the rest of the riff-raff!"
Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said if I'm late one more time he'll kick me right out the door!
"That s'wit. One day, he'll regret pushing all of us around."
What do you mean?
All I'm saying is Indaryn's going to push someone too far one day and they're going to push back... hard.
I don't know if I can stand the abuse here much longer. They treat us like outcasts.
"The Dark Elves and the Wood Elves have never been the best of friends. Be patient, they'll come around soon enough!"
Wretched Dark Elves. It's just my luck I ended up working under one of them.
"Chin up, Ungrien! Remember, you have a roof over your head and food in your belly thanks to the very same Dark Elves. Be thankful."
"You keep giving and giving Bersi, and they'll keep taking and taking. When is it going to end?"
"What would you have me do, woman? Cross the Guild? Take them all on one by one?"
You know I don't mean that. We need to find a way out of this. Perhaps talk to Laila...
"Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves."
Drifa? I was looking through our books and there's an entry for [QUOTE]spices.[QUOTE] Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?
Spices? I'm certain I have no idea what you're talking about.
You sure? It was in your handwriting. If you can't keep the books straight then let me do them.
"Oh, yes... spices. That was a special order for someone in Whiterun. Should be along any day now. Don't let it worry you, my dear."
"Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?"
"I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant."
Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear?
"Yes, mother."
"Hemming, I need you to bring a note to Sibbi. I need him to do something for me."
Sibbi? He's in prison... you put him there.
I know that!
"I can promise you when he's ready, he'll find the cell door unlocked."
"Why do you tolerate him, mother? All he contributes to this family is embarrassment and disgrace."
"I tolerate your son because he'll do anything I ask, without question. I'd expect the same from my own son."
"I understand, mother. Forgive me."
"They laughed at me again, Dinya. They simply don't understand."
"I'm so sorry my husband. You must remember, they're at the Bee and Barb to drink, not to listen to a sermon."
"Yes, yes, I know. I just wish to show them there's more to life than drowning your sorrows in a goblet of mead."
"You're a good man, Maramal. We're lucky to have you watching over us."
"It fills me with joy to hear you're with child, Dinya. They said it wouldn't... that it couldn't happen, but Mara has shown them they're mistake."
And to think I was wandering the ash wastes only two years ago. I never knew my path would lead to you.
You were guided here; you were always meant to be here. That's the way of things.
"Then I thank Lady Mara with all my heart; for you, for our child and for our love."
"How are things at the Meadery, my dear?"
Not this again...
"Hush, Vulwulf... let the boy speak."
"It's going very well, actually. The war hasn't even slowed down our production or shipping at all."
Of course it is. That's what happens when you're partners with a corrupt Imperial whore like Maven.
"Vulwulf! The Empire may be our enemy, but Asgeir is still our son and we're a long way from Cyrodiil."
"Father, I promise you, this has nothing to do with Empires or politics. It's just business."
"It has everything to do with politics. Asgeir my son, you have so much to learn."
"Mother, what can I do to make father happier? It seems no matter how successful I become he doesn't care."
Of course he cares. You just have to understand that your father was a soldier and he'll always be a soldier.
He just wants you to follow in his footsteps.
I understand. It just isn't me. I'm not a warrior and I don't think I ever will be.
"Then by Talos, you do what you feel you're meant to do. I'll take care of your father for you."
You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.
It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight for to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?
That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.
You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people; to fight to keep us free.
"You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land."
"No. I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste."
"Aunt Haelga, why you... demean yourself with these people you barely know? They show no real love for you."
"It's only a bit of fun. You're a lovely young thing, you should try it sometime."
No! I'm saving myself for someone special. Someone who loves me dearly.
You mean Sibbi? You must be joking! All he wants to do is bed you and be done with it. You may as well get it over with and let him.
You're wrong! Sibbi and I are in love and you're just jealous!
Svana! Has that skooma-addled idiot Niluva paid us her rent yet? Or does she have more excuses?
"She said she'll have it soon. She still has her job at the meadery for now, so she'll be able to pay us."
Why do you insist on defending that woman? All she does with her money is spend it on that Dark Elf garbage!
"Just be patient, aunt. She'll have it, I promise."
"Hey, Svana... I hear you like Dark Elves. Perhaps I could should you what a real Dark Elf can do to you."
"You're an animal, Tythis... keep away from me."
"Ah, so my reputation as a lover precedes me. Care to reconsider?"
You're disgusting! Don't you even think of laying a finger on me or I'll cut off something you can't live without.
"So, Brand-Shei... business as awful for you as it is for all of us?"
"Worse. The Khajiit Caravans are the only way to get supplies into the city, and even those are becoming more infrequent."
"Well, let's all raise a flagon to Ulfric; future King of Skyrim and bringer of poverty to the working class!"
Grelka! Lower your voice before you get us both in trouble.
"Drink up, my boy! Drink to those who have fallen! May their souls find their way to Sovngarde!"
"Take it easy, father. You're making a scene."
I'll rest easy when we've driven every last Imperial pig back across the Jerall Mountains!
"Now, do me the honor I deserve as your father and drink up!"
Yes... father.
"You've been in Riften for quite some time now, Lady Mjoll. I fear that you soon may leave us."
Riften has problems of its own. Now is not the time for exploration and discovery.
"I'm relieved to hear you say that. If you were to leave, I'd miss you terribly."
"Aerin, I owe you my life. It would take a threat to all of Skyrim for me to depart."
"Romlyn, I've been meaning to speak to you. I did a count at the meadery and we're four cases short... again."
What are you saying? You think I had something to do with that?
I'm not accusing you of anything. Yet.
"The Dreth family doesn't steal, Indaryn."
"For your sake, I hope you're right. Because if it is you, and Maven finds out, the Dreth family is going to be one member smaller."
"Hemming, I want you to personally supervise the next shipment."
We already have people that do that and they make quite a bit of coin for it.
"I don't trust them. Come to think of it, I don't trust you either, but at least you're family."
"Anything you say, Mother."
Bersi still refuses to cooperate. What did you want to do?
I've known Bersi a long time. Even before he opened that rubbish heap he calls a shop.
Give him one more week to think about it.
And if he still refuses?
Then put the thumbscrews on him and hit him... hard.
I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me.
It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says [QUOTE]sand elske.[QUOTE]
I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.
Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.
"Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again. I'm sorry."
"Ah, Nivenor. What can I sell you on this fine day?"
I'm looking for a necklace. Do you have anything with garnets?
"I have a single one left, quite expensive, but also quite elegant."
Posh. I'm not paying for it. Put it on Bolli's account if you please.
"Madesi, what's this bill for 300 septims!"
"Begging your pardon, milord. Your wife has run up quite an account in the last few months."
Outrageous! Who does she think she is?!
"Lady Haelga, so pleased to see you. Your Marks of Dibella are ready."
"Oh, splendid! I can't wait to use them."
"Begging your pardon milady... I know these have something to do with Dibella, but whatever are they for?"
"Maybe I'll show you one day, Madesi. Have them delivered to the Bunkhouse, won't you?"
"We got a few pieces of jewelry at the Prawn, Madesi. Want to come take a look at them later?"
"I wish I could, milady. Sadly, I haven't sold enough of my own jewelry let alone buy some from you. I'm sorry."
"Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm certain Bolli would be happy to lend you a few septims."
"Much appreciated, Lady Drifa, but I'll manage."
"When are you going to stop by the temple, Madesi?"
"Sorry Lady Dinya, but I've been busy of late."
"It only takes but a moment to say a silent prayer to Mara. Please come by soon; not for me, but for yourself."
"Very well, I'll try milady."
"Lady Maven, how may I help you?"
Is it true that you refused to sell one of your... trinkets to Hemming?
"Please, milady, it was only because he threatened me. He said he'd have me thrown in the prisons if I didn't give him what he wanted!"
I can't afford to just give my jewelry away!
"Next time a Black-Briar asks for something, I suggest you respond quickly and affirmatively."
"Hello, Lady Mjoll."
"Madesi, my friend. How have things been since last week's incident?"
"Ever since you scared off that thug from the Thieves Guild, not one of them's bothered me. We're lucky to have you here."
"It's my pleasure. If you see the Thieves Guild harassing anyone else, you be sure and let me know."
"Here's another septim, Madesi. How much more do I need?"
"Only thirty more and it'll be all yours. If I might ask, who is the lucky woman?"
"It's for Marise, but don't say a word to her!"
"Don't worry, Shadr, your secret is safe with me."
"Anuriel, a word please."
"Yes, my lady?"
It's been brought to my attention that the poison known as skooma may be present in our city. What do you know of this?
I believe it to be a falsehood perpetrated by the Empire in order to weaken the citizen's confidence in your ability to rule.
"Excellent, then they'll be no need to devote any resources to stopping it. Thank you, Anuriel. That will be all."
"My lady, Maven Black-Briar has sent word that she requires your seal in order to expand her shipments into Morrowind."
But of course! Tell her she'll have it. Maven is one of the few people I can trust and I'd be delighted to give her my blessing.
"Yes, my lady. I will pass the good news on to her."
"Mother, how long must we put up with Saerlund spouting his nonsense about the Empire?"
"What would you have me do, send him to the gallows for treason? He's your brother, Harrald."
"My only concern is your safety, mother. One can only imagine the sordid types he may be conspiring with to bring about your downfall."
"I will hear no more of this, Harrald. Do you understand me? No more!"
"Harrald, I have need of you."
Yes mother? What is it?
This situation with the sewers beneath the city. I hear people have entered this place and have gone missing. Do you know of this?
"Yes, I've heard such things. Anuriel assures me they're just fabrications and there's nothing down there save a few stray skeever."
"Well, make sure we keep the patrols out night and day, just to be certain."
"I see you still have the run of the place, traitor."
"Come now brother, don't act all high and mighty. I know you could care less about the war one way or another."
The things you say are just an act to please mother.
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
I'm disappointed in you brother. You had it all. You had it all and your mouth cost you everything.
At least I've chosen a side instead of acting like a spectator.
"One day, you'll be forced to make a choice. And I hope it's the right one, brother."
"So, is this what it's come to? You'd have your own flesh and blood hanged just to solidify your grip as the next Jarl?"
If that's what it will take then so be it.
What's become of us? We used to be inseparable... always fighting back to back and letting nothing stand in our way.
"You've changed, brother. And not for the better I'm afraid."
I've done what I needed to do keep mother happy. It doesn't matter what I really believe.
"You've done what you've had to for yourself, not for mother."
"Wise up, Harrald. There's a storm on the horizon and it will blow through here with all its fury. It's time to choose a side."
"Unmid, my sweet. Are we still meeting later for... combat training?"
Of course. Your training isn't complete yet.
I look forward to it then.
"Anuriel, would you please stop declaring that the city is safe for the Jarl to roam? You and I both know that isn't true."
"I would never knowingly place Laila in danger, you know that too. Why do you always question my judgment? You don't trust me."
"I trust you, I'm just concerned about her safety. That's all. Don't be angry with me."
"I'm not angry with you. Tell you what, lover. Meet me in my chambers later and we can discuss the situation in private."
"Unmid, I wish to travel about the city. Prepare an escort please."
"Begging your pardon my lady, but I strongly recommend against it."
Anuriel seems to think that seeing me on the streets might bolster the city's morale.
"My lady, there could be agents of the Empire looking for an opportunity like that to have you killed. Are you willing to take that risk?"
"No. Of course you're right, Unmid. I'll stay here for now."
Do you realize how delicate the experiment is you've interrupted by sending for me? I may need to throw out the components and start again.
"How dare you take that kind of tone. You're in service to me, remember?"
I'm sorry my lady. The stresses of all this research... it's becoming more than I can bear.
"You're forgiven. Now, I want to know if you've made any progress with my son. Is he cursed? Has he been possessed?"
"Sorry, my lady. I've been looking but I'm convinced Saerlund says truly believes what he is saying."
Very well. Keep at it. You may go.
Steady. I don't know what's happening. Let's watch and wait.
Wait. Something's happening... gods above!
Why are we stopping?
Why do you think? End of the line.
No! Wait! We're not rebels!
You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!
Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.
Whoa!









Thank you.
Free...again.
At last.


You...must...die.
Must...kill.
Kill.

Slay it! Slay the dragon!
"You'll die this day, dragon!"
Werewolf! Kill the monster!
"Come on, you monster!"
"Die, you filthy beast!"
Skyrim belongs to the Nords!
You're a disgrace to your own kind!
You call yourself a Nord?
Your kind has no place here!
"You should've stayed in your precious forests, elf!"
"Die, you Orc filth!"
I'm gonna wear that tail as a belt!
"You'll make a fine rug, cat!"
"You remind me of my cousin's cat. Killed that, too!"
Let's see what you've got!
Shor have mercy on you!
I'll rip your heart out!
You think you can take me?
I'll carve you into pieces!
I'll mount your head on my wall!
Ha ha! I love a challenge!
You won't leave Skyrim alive!
True Nords never back down!
You won't get the best of me!
You won't leave here alive!
I'll bury you!
You're dead! Dead!
You ready to die today? Huh?
Damn you...
Just give up!
Prepare to die!
This is the end for you!
"I swear, I'll kill you!"
You won't live to see tomorrow!
I can take you!
You can't beat me!
This ends now!
Victory or Sovngarde!
I'll make you pay!
You've already lost!
You don't have a chance!
I'll see you in pieces!
There's no escape!
Show me what you've got!
Come on!
Put up a real fight!
I've fought worse than you!
"You're nothing, hear me? Nothing!"
I can do this all day!
This is what I've trained for!
No one can save you now!
You're a dead man!
You're a dead woman!
I'll kill you if I have to!
You won't get the best of me!
Now you'll pay!
Are you prepared to die?
I've fought worse than you!
I'll show you what a real Orc can do!
Pray to Stendarr while you can!
I'll show you a real fight!
No one bests an Orc!
You puny weakling!
I'll skin you alive!
You're a fool to fight me!
For blood! For glory!
Take your best shot!
Your death brings me honor!
Beg for your miserable life!
I'll have your head for a trophy!
Pray to your gods for mercy!
I'll rip you in half!
I'll tear you to pieces!
I'm going to crush you like a bug!
You won't get away from me!
You're good as dead!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll fix you good!
You're making me angry!
Graaah! I'll get you!
Why won't you die!
I can take you!
This is the end for you!
You're out of your league!
This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!
I'll see you dead and buried!
I'll gladly kill you myself!
You've dug your own grave!
You're outmatched!
Enjoy your last breath!
You won't get away!
I'll bathe in your blood!
This is your last mistake!
You won't even live to regret this!
You'll beg me to kill you before I'm done!
No one crosses me!
You can't beat me!
Just give up! You can't win!
I'll gut you like a horker!
You're going to pay!
I'll carve you into pieces!
I won't hold back!
"I'll kill you, I swear it!"
I won't back down!
I'll fight you to the end!
I can take you!
You won't get me!
Your end draws near!
You're pathetic!
You dare challenge me?
You're no match for me!
You've already lost!
The White take you!
You're as good as dead!
I love a good fight!
Think you can take me?
Your end draws near!
I'll paint the snow with your blood!
Sovngarde awaits you!
Death awaits you!
I haven't lived this long to be beaten by you!
I can still put up a fight!
I've fought colds tougher than you!
I've got some fight left in me!
"I may be old, but I can put up a fight!"
I won't go down so easily!
Look what you've made me do!
I've outlived worse than this!
You need to learn some manners!
You should respect your elders!
I've still got some fight in me!
You brought this on yourself!
I'll see you burn!
I'll end your miserable life!
You don't stand a chance!
This is your last mistake!
You're outmatched!
You're already dead.
You can't defeat me!
"Come on, fight back!"
I. Will. Destroy you!
Come on! Let's see you put up a fight!
"Come on, show me what you've got!"
You think I'm afraid of you?
Yield to me!
I'm going to enjoy this!
I'll kill you where you stand!
And you thought I was just a pretty face.
I'll raise a cup to your grave!
Remember... hit the one in the middle!
Everybody pushes me around. Well no more!
I'll... get you!
Stand... still!
You dare fight a Dunmer?
Azura curse you!
Nerevar guide me!
Nerevar guide me!
Hssssssss!
"Yield, and I may still show mercy!"
Time for you to die!
You think you stand a chance?
You're pathetic!
Going to enjoy killing you!
Foul blood drinker!
"Yes, because a worthless City Orc is just what we've been waiting for. Finally, we're saved!"
"Oh, of course! Because Malacath would take pity on us if only a useless outsider would lend a hand."
"I am the one cursed by Malacath. It is my burden. I bear it, and continue to lead, and the others see how strong I am. That is how I rule."
"Are you blind, or just stupid? You think the tribe has not seen you talking to me? You think they would not know?"
Do not mistake our life for one of stupidity. It would be the last mistake you make.
Hrmph. Breaking a curse is not a simple thing. It is dangerous.
But... To have won against Malacath himself... That would be seen as real power.
"Perhaps... Perhaps it might. If nothing else, you could be an excellent sacrifice to Malacath."
You really want to help? You go offer yourself at Malacath's Shrine. Petition him for help.
He might not devour you whole.
You persist? Fine. You go tell Malacath to lift this curse from me. See how well he listens to you.
Offer yourself up as a sacrifice while you're there.
What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!
"You want me to let a dragon into the heart of my city, with the threat of war on my doorstep?"
What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!
"Why would I agree to let a dragon into the heart of my city, after working so hard to keep them out?"
The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
But they don't say how he does this.
You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved themselves in political affairs.
Although... it might be difficult to persuade the Jarl to allow you to use his palace as a dragon trap...
"I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond you."
An unguessed trove of lost lore... but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew.
"Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up."
"Od - Ah - Viing. [QUOTE]Winged Snow Hunter,[QUOTE] as I read it."
I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a dragon in my palace.
What do you think the Imperials would be doing while this dragon is busy slaughtering my men?
Do you think the Stormcloaks will sit idle while this dragon is slaughtering my men and burning down my city?
Ulfric and General Tullius are both just waiting for me to make a wrong move.
Do you think they will sit idle while a dragon is slaughtering my men and burning my city?
No. I can't risk weakening the city while we are under the threat of enemy attack. I'm sorry.
Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme.
But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep.
Maybe... hmm... what of the Greybeards? They are respected by all Nords. High Hrothgar is neutral territory.
If the Greybeards were willing to host a peace council... then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.
"Yes. This was ages ago, you understand. There were more of us then. Before the bruniikke - the Akaviri - came and killed all my zeymah."
I used to visit him from time to time. Nearly crazed by loneliness and captivity. Tiiraz sivaas. He did not even remember his own name.
I do not know how he came to be caught. But the bronjun... the Jarl... was very proud of his pet. Paak!
The hofkahsejun has been known as Dragonsreach ever since.
According to legend. Although I never thought to put the tale to the test.
"Jarl Olaf One-Eye it was, who later became High King."
They say he Shouted it into submission in single combat atop Mount Anthor and brought it back to Whiterun.
Numinex was the dragon's name. That's his skull decorating the main hall.
"Why, why have you done this to us?"
I cannot protect you if you murder us. This is the only warning you will receive.
Lot krongrah. You truly have the Voice of a dovah. Alduin's allies will think twice after this victory.
Yes... one of his allies could tell us. Motmahus... But it will not be so easy to... convince one of them to betray him.
Perhaps the hofkahsejun - the palace in Whiterun... Dragonsreach. It was originally built to house a captive dovah.
"A fine place to trap one of Alduin's allies, hmm?"
"Ni liivrah hin moro. True, this is not the final krongrah - victory. But not even the heroes of old were able to defeat Alduin in open battle."
Alduin always was pahlok - arrogant in his power. Uznahgar paar. He took domination as his birthright.
This should shake the loyalty of the dov who serve him.
"Hmm, yes. But your su'um is strong. I do not doubt that you can convince him of the need."
"It is time, Yamarz."
"You bring an outsider here, and now insist I call on Malacath for help, when he has clearly forsaken me? You try my patience, Atub."
Doing nothing will not grant our tribe relief from this curse. We must try.
"Grrr. Fine, let's get this over with."
Ain't used to strangers here in Riverwood.
"I'm spoken for, you know. So don't get any ideas."
"You're pretty, I'll give ya that. Just stay away from my husband, Alvor."
"Alvor and I, we got a daughter. Little Dorthe."
He would dote on her so much. Let her work the forge and everything. I miss him so.
My girl likes to work the forge with her papa.
All of that blacksmithing... It's not good for a little girl. Ain't... ladylike.
Dorthe needs to spend more time in the garden. I could use the help.
"It don't matter what I grow - my Alvor, he'll eat anything."
Maybe I'll do turnips next. Hmmm... Or maybe radishes?
"New to Riverwood? If you're looking for work, go see Hod at the mill."
"We're a small village, but we work hard, and take care of our own."
"I own the lumber mill, and pay a fair wage. See my husband Hod if you're looking for work."
Only worry we've got is the war reaching this far.
"Years past, the lumber was used for houses or furniture. Now, the soldiers just buy it all."
The thought of my wood being used for weapons... Makes me sick.
No use thinkin' of things I can't change. Too much work to be done...
You look like a traveler. Someone that has seen far away places and heard new stories.
You should come hear me play at the Sleeping Giant Inn. For a small sum you can even pick the song.
"I've been trained as a skald, as was my father, and my father's father before him."
My time at the Bards College was brief. A prodigy has little need for formal education.
"I'm composing a new song. A ballad, for Camilla Valerius."
Some day Camilla will know of my affections. Some day...
A new face. And a right fair one at that.
A new face. And a right ugly one at that. No offence.
"Got business here in Riverwood, eh? There are worse villages."
At least the damned war hasn't gotten here. Yet.
"We work hard, try to do right by our families."
"Me, I've got my axe, my wife Gerdur and my boy Frodnar. That's all I need."
Woodcutting's my trade. Best log splitter from here to Riften.
"It's all in the way you hold the axe. Caress it, like any wench, and she'll do ya right."
You met Camilla yet? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on those trunks. He he he he.
"Now you, lass... You've got some beautiful trunks yourself... Hmm?"
Well... I'll let you go about your business.
"You're new around here, so I'll go easy on ya. But don't get on my bad side."
"Get me mad, and I'll prank ya. And not a little. A lot."
"Ah, everybody around here's so serious."
"So I like to have a little fun, so what?"
"My friend Dorthe doesn't like my pranking. [QUOTE]You're being mean, Frodnar![QUOTE] So what if I am?"
Mother wants me to work at the mill. But I ain't nobody's slave.
You gotta have better things to do than talk to me all day...
Did I see you talking to Sven? Maybe not. Maybe...nevermind. But I would stay away from him if I were you.
"Greetings, sister Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home."
"Greetings, brother Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home."
"Riverwood's agreeable enough, I suppose. For a Nord village."
"There's beauty here unmatched in all of Skyrim, to be sure."
Maybe you've already met Camilla Valerius?
If only Camilla shared my affections. Or even knew about them.
"Are you a hunter, by chance? The hills surrounding the village are ripe with game."
"I work at the lumber mill, but I escape into the forest whenever possible."
"I miss Valenwood, but the wilds here are... serviceable."
"I don't like to brag, but I once took down a bear at three hundred yards. In a blizzard."
"We got rooms and food. Drink, too. I cook. Ain't much else to tell."
"Need a room, talk to Delphine."
"I'm just the cook, lad."
"I'm just the cook, lass."
I ain't lookin' to make friends.
You like Skeever liver. No? Tough luck.
Food's hot. Never said it was good.
"You're that visitor, been pokin' around."
I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.
We don't get a lot of travelers here in Riverwood.
"The war keeps most folks away, these days."
"Most of my customers are locals, come to relax after a hard day's toil."
So what's your story? Just here to... relax?
You look like you could use an ale.
"If you're staying the night, I've got a free room."
Wanderer like you must have quite an appetite. Some food?
You're a strapping young man. Don't be a stranger.
"The men here like my attention, and I like theirs. Best know your place."
You're not from around here. That makes two of us.
"I came here from the Imperial Province, to work with my brother Lucan."
It got bad back in Cyrodiil. The war with the Thalmor ruined... everything.
I came to Skyrim looking for a better life. So what did I get? Another war.
"I just want to find a good husband, and start a family of my own."
The Riverwood Trader is everything you need in a general store.
My sister Camilla or I will be happy to help you.
Maybe you're looking for something... particular?
We carry just about anything you could need...
"I know some of it looks like junk, but everything's a treasure in the right light."
Ain't every day we get visitors in Riverwood.
"Whatever you need. By Ysmir, if it's simple and strong, I can forge it."
You lookin' for a new blade?
Iron or steel is what you need. Leave that fancy Elven stuff to the Elves.
Iron and steel mostly. I might even have some of your fancy Elven pieces lying around somewhere...
I could forge you a warhammer that would crush a giant's head like a walnut.
You the sneaky type? Got some nice daggers around here somewhere...
"Papa says I'm too friendly with strangers, but you seem all right."
"My father is Alvor, the blacksmith. I'm his assistant. I mean, apprentice."
Some day I'm going to forge my own sword!
Papa says I'm not ready for weapons. So I make lots of horseshoes and hobnails.
Mama doesn't think I'm girlish enough. But that's just stupid girl talk.
"Papa may have wanted a son, but he got me. He's a lucky man."
Ain't nothin' a boy can do that I can't do better.
"Nobody believes me, but I tell you, I saw a dragon!"
"By Shor, what do you want?"
"It's my boy Sven you need to listen to. He sings at the inn, most every night."
Sven has the voice of a snow lark. Only good thing he got from his father.
My boy fancies that Camilla Valerius. She'll come around soon enough.
"Camilla, I've seen her talking to that Faendal. Filthy elf needs to keep to his own kind..."
"What happened to my Skyrim? Everywhere you look, cats, lizards and elves. It's sickening."
"I raised my Sven to be strong, and proud. A true Nord."
You're kinda fuzzy. What's wrong with ya?
"Outta my way, stranger."
"Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now."
They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.
"Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now."
They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.
"We've got something of a love triangle here in Riverwood. Faendal and Sven, both vying for Camilla's affections."
"Many years ago I lost my blade, [QUOTE]Grimsever,[QUOTE] within a Dwemer ruin. I took it as a sign that I was wasting my days in search of wealth."
"You and I are alike. We seek challenge and great fortune. But for me, that's where the similarities end."
"You see, Riften is my great beast to be slain and my fortune comes from gratitude and trust."
Its been difficult. I've taken the burdens of this city's problems upon myself and I keep running into impossible obstacles.
"Corruption, lies and deceit are the order of the day here."
"If it wasn't for Aerin, the young man who saved my life, I think I'd already have given up long ago."
I was adventuring in the depths of the ruins when I was attacked by a massive construct... like nothing I had ever seen.
"When the colossus struck, Grimsever was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly."
It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the Dwemer abomination and make my way to the surface.
"I must have collapsed, because the next thing I remember is Aerin standing over me tending to my wounds."
It was lost years ago in a Dwemer ruin.
"Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement."
"I couldn't ask you to undertake such a trecherous journey, it would be a fool's errand."
But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away.
"Grimsever rests with the Dwemer ruin of Mzinchaleft. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life."
"Yes, quite a shame. It was a fine weapon."
To call it a guild is ridiculous. How can people who would betray one another over a gold coin be considered part of an association?
They're the worst kind. Even the Dark Brotherhood abides by a strict set of rules and tradition. These thieves are just rabble.
What do you think?
"Hardly! In fact, I don't know how I get anything done with all of the distractions I have to put up with."
"My wife Hafjorg, well, she's a necessary evil I suppose. Not a lick of talent when it comes to alchemy, but she keeps me fed."
"Then there's Ingun Black-Briar. Bright young thing and a worthy apprentice, when she isn't wasting my rare ingredients."
"Keerava, we're running low on Black-Briar Mead."
If only Maven would stop raising the price on it maybe I could afford to stock more cases.
We could always look for another brand.
That isn't an option. Maven sees me serve a competitor's brand here and we may as well dig our own graves.
"Don't worry, the time will come when we can walk away from here."
I hope so. I can't stand this city anymore.
"Damn it, Talen. We still don't have enough this year to get out of Riften."
"Why don't they listen to me, Keerava? Why won't they do as I say?"
Maybe they're afraid of you. Maybe it's your breath. How should I know?
They always try to take advantage of me. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
"I'll tell you one thing, if you don't make peace with them soon you may get a walkout on your hands. Then we're both in trouble."
"Talen my friend, up for some fishing this week?"
I don't know Bolli. It's getting dangerous outside the walls.
"Oh come now, what's a dragon or two compared to a day full of fishing!"
"That's not funny, Bolli. People are scared."
"Meyz mul, Dovahkiin. You have become strong."
"But I am Al-du-in, Firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you or anyone else!"
"Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor. My belly is full of the souls of your fellow mortals, Dovahkiin."
Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!
"Lost funt. You are too late, Alduin!"
Unslaad hokoron! Never again!

"You may have picked up the weapons of my ancient foes, but you are not their equal!"
"Please, please let me out of here!"
You have to let me out. They're going to do something awful to me!
"There's a lever, right there in the center. Hurry, before more of them show up!"
"Yes, yes! Did Arch-Mage Aren send you? He sent you to rescue me, didn't he?"
What? The bo... Oh. Oh dear.
"I shouldn't have taken them, I know! It was stupid. I was stupid. It won't happen again."
"Help me get out of here, and I'll help you find them. Please!"
I don't have them anymore. She took them... The Caller. She's the one who put me in here!
"Please, let me out of here!"
"Thank you, thank you! I promise I'll help. And then I'll go back to the College and I'll beg them to let me back in."
"Oh, you've saved me! Thank you so much. Who knows what they'd have done to me if you hadn't come along."
I promise I'll help you get out of here.
"Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!"
"Suleyki mulaag, Paarthurnax. My power has waxed, while yours has waned."
"I like your shop, Lami."
"Thank you, dear. It must be nice to get out of the hall every now and then."
"Oh, I quite like living in the hall. Mother says it's an honor to live there and serve Morthal."
"Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that it's not."
Morthal will be mine to govern someday. I have a great deal to learn.
"Yes, I'm sure that's true."
"How are the headaches, dear? You or your mother still having them?"
"Oh, yes. All the time. They come with the visions, as always."
Are you sure you don't want something for them? I may be able to brew you something to help.
Oh no! I couldn't. Mother says they are a burden we must bear for our gift.
"Well dear, you know where to find me if it ever becomes too much for you."
"When I grow up, will I go to the College in Winterhold?"
"No, I don't think that will be necessary."
"But I'm learning about magic, and that's what they do there. Shouldn't I go?"
The College is not the only place to learn about magic.
"But you went there, didn't you? Isn't that where you learned?"
I was there only for a short time. Much of what I have learned has been on my own. And I will teach you. You have no reason to go there.
But...
That is enough.
Have you been working on your concentration?
"Yes sir, I have."
Good. Concentration is paramount when dealing with magical forces.
Why?
Because an unfocused mind will almost certainly be obliterated. Destroyed by the forces you attempt to control and yield.
Oh.
Have no fear. I believe it is within you to excel in your studies. But you must learn to concentrate!
"Yes, sir."
I had a bad dream again last night.
Oh?
I dreamt that you went away. You made monsters.
"It's just a dream, child. Nothing more."
It was scary. It was like it was real!
Hush now. Think no more of it.
How are you feeling?
"I feel wonderful, just like every night."
Do you need anything? Are you hungry?
"Oh Hroggar, you know I'm always hungry. Don't worry, I'll eat when I need to."
"Oh, look! We have company!"
"Jonna, do you think the townspeople are warming to my serenades?"
"No. They ain't. And they aren't gonna. If you weren't payin' for your room, I'd have thrown you out a long time ago."
"Yes, but they'll come around eventually. You'll see."
"Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if they come 'round. And if you're never seen or heard from agin."
"I'm thinking of composing a song about you, Jonna. Would you prefer that I proclaim your beauty, your strength, your..."
Nah. Just... don't. Leave me outta it.
No interest in being immortalized in song? Remembered and praised for all eternity?
No. I mean it.
"When I'm known throughout Tamriel, you'll regret this decision."
"Ho, Gorm."
Buy you a drink?
Not right now. Anything new?
"Still the same. I tell you, something's got to be done."
"When the time is right, friend. When we're sure."
"The longer we wait, the worse it gets."
Let's talk about it some other time.
"What can I getcha, Alva?"
"What can't you get me, sweetie?"
Umm... Did you want somethin' to eat?
"Eat? No, I don't think I'm... hungry. Not now, at least."
"Right. Okay, tell me if you change yer mind."
I cannot thank you enough for all of the help.
"I run the mill, so I'm a busy woman. What is it?"
Always something going wrong. Mill needs more lumber or the saw needs sharpening.
"A good lumberjack is quiet, hard-working, and honest."
"I used to work at Anga's Mill, but I... I had to leave."
Someone's after me I tell you. They're watching me. Somewhere.
Don't talk to me. You could be one of them.
Strangers are always trouble.
I don't need to talk to you. Get lost.
Aeri's the boss. Should talk to her if you want work.
"I work at the mill. Chop trees, carry logs, saw lumber, you know."
Whatever happened to Ennodius? He just up and left.
Don't know why you're asking me. But I'm glad that damn Imperial is gone. Something wrong about him.
"You're all heart, Kodrir. I bet Lady Mara is weeping a special tear for you right now."
I swear that woman Aeri doesn't appreciate all the work I do for her damn mill.
"Oh, I've heard this one before. Watch out Divines, poor Kodrir curses you all for giving him life!"
Watch your mouth with me you pup! Who do you think you are?
The man doing your job?
"It's an old city. Legends say Dwarves built it first. Then after they vanished, the natives moved in."
"Finally, the Nords took over around Tiber Septim's time. That bent a few folks' arms the wrong way."
"That's right, at least according to them scholars. Stonework's clearly not Nord, that much is for sure."
Old Elven fella named Calcelmo is up in Understone Keep's the one you want to talk to for more about that. Wrote all those books.
That's right. Whole group of the natives called the Forsworn rose up against the Nords. Drove them out.
"Then Ulfric Stormcloak came with his militia. That must have been a sight to see, him shouting folks to death."
"You'd think that'd be the end of it, but those Forsworn are still in the hills, and they're as wild as wolves."
I'm Anska.  Are you here to help?
I've finally located Vokun's crypt! The scroll I'm looking for just has to be here.
"If Vokun is as powerful as I think, I may need a little help um ... dealing ...with him."
"Great, with the two of us this should be easy."
You can have anything except the scroll of course.
Oh alright.  Well I'll be here for a bit if you change your mind.
Don't fall.
"That would be Jarl Igmund. Young for a ruler of a Hold, especially the Reach."
Wasn't surprising he stayed loyal to the Empire. His father helped capture Ulfric Stormcloak after the Markarth Incident.
"Since the Stormcloaks took over, Jarl Thongvor is in charge."
"It'll be lean times for the Reach with a Silver-Blood ruling it, that's for certain."
"It's the whole reason Ulfric revolted against the Empire. Well, the first reason anyway."
"Forsworn had taken over Markarth, and Ulfric and his men drove them out. Empire promised they'd be free to worship Talos afterwards."
Pity no one told the Elves. Whole group of those Thalmor came and they demanded Ulfric's arrest.
"Before the Nords came, we worshipped the old gods, had our own kingdom."
"Times have been good and bad since then, but some folks couldn't handle not ruling their own land. Those are the Forsworn."
"The Forsworn follow the old ways, but some of those were best forgotten. Blood sacrifices, communing with Daedra. It's the road to ruin."
"Is there something you need, dear?"
"I... I'm not sure. I think perhaps, but I don't know what it is."
"All right, can you describe it to me?"
"No, I'm sorry. I'll just... I'll know it if I find it. Does that make sense?"
"If it does to you, dear, that's all that matters."
"Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of yours, old man."
"He will come. He cannot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear us, even now?"
We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade alone this day.
"But none have yet stood against Alduin himself. Galthor, Sorri, Birkir..."
"They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I will have his head."
Felldir! We agreed not to use it!
"No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now."
"I never agreed. And if you are right, I will not need it."
You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon. He is beyond our strength.
We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!
So be it.
Let those that watch from Sovngarde envy us this day!
Skyrim will be free!
"It's no use! Use the Scroll, Felldir! Now!"
"Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to make this contract heard!"
It worked... you did it...
"Yes, the World-Eater is gone... may the spirits have mercy on our souls."
"It's a small town, with one rather unique feature - it houses Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost."
"It was established by Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago. When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit."
"Yes. Do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting."
"There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro and the Stormcloaks in the Emperor's assassination."
"Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun."
"Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up."
"No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon Bridge. However, there is one other option..."
"We know there's an actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial..."
"Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine."
"I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said. Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your observations and move on."
"I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong."
"Son, when the Emperor's safety is concerned, anything could go wrong. Off with you, now. And good travels."
"Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able."
"Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?"
"Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my heart. I'll see you soon."
"If you're trying to ask if I tend the hall of the dead alone, then the answer is yes."
You think anyone around here is going to lift a shovel to help me? Guess again. [QUOTE]Leave the dirty work to old Alessandra.[QUOTE]
"Look, I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father."
"My father was a Priest of Arkay. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers."
I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with [QUOTE]the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?[QUOTE]
So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.
"I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker."
I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory.
I hadn't asked you because I was afraid you'd say no. I appreciate your help.
"Here, I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest."
"Yes. Perhaps one day I'll be able to make the journey, but for now I need to tend the dead."
"I felt a caress on my cheek some time ago... I thought it to be a trick of the wind, but I think it was a message from my father."
We've made peace with one another without even uttering a single word and I'm content for the first time in my life.
"I thank you. Here, please accept this as a token of my appreciation for your selfless action."
"Someone actually interested in what I'm doing? Amazing! Well, allow me to explain."
My experimentation involves a magical construct and a reagent that will allow the construct to maintain a field of permanent harmonic energy!
"You don't have to, because it's utter nonsense. It's never going to work."
"No, no, no. What I need to do is to reverse that. Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent and then apply it with the proper incantation."
What was I thinking? It would never work that first way. Why didn't you tell me?
I'll tell you why you won't tell me. Because you were absolutely right not to.
It's a fundamental rule of magic and it would be ridiculous. You can't draw from harmonic energy without a soul siphon.
"Since you're so well informed I'm certain you've solved the problem with thermic drift, right?"
What's not to get? It's as simple as Traven's First Axiom of Magic... or was it Galerion's Law of Casting. Hmm.
"I'll tell you what, let me find out where that's from. I'll need to look through my library... and get you an answer."
Umm... what were we talking about?
"Yes, I could use some help with that. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy."
"Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get."
"In fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments."
"I had a look at that boneyard the other day, Vantus. The one to the Northwest."
I told you I don't like you going there. I've seen scavengers picking at the mammoths. They could be dangerous.
"You know, I was thinking of expanding the herb garden. Make room for some new plants I'm planning."
That should be all right. How much space were you planning?
"Oh, half the field should do."
Half the field? What could need half the field?
I just think pollinating would be easier if I could do a lot of plants at once.
Uh... why don't we talk about this later?
"As you can imagine, I tend to forget things often. Leave things around. I really must learn to put these things away."
"What I need is my Dwemer Stirring Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately."
"Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you."
Excellent. I can't wait.
"Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help."
A shame. Perhaps another time then.
Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called.
The orichalcum ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me.
And last is the soul gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.
Items? What items? Let me see those.
"Hmm. I'm not sure how you managed it, but these are exactly what I need to start my next set of experiments. Wonderful!"
"Well, at least allow me to reward you for your uncanny foresight."
"When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters here to die."
"Think the guards will be coming down, soon?"
"Ah, it's not been more than a few days since they came down the last time."
Think maybe we should jump the guards when they come down next?
"They keep the doors locked when they come down. You kill them, you're trapping us here with no food."
Nearly broke my back out in the mines today. Damn Nords should bleed for putting us through this!
"Some day, brother. Some day."
Have any skooma? I need to get something from Grisvar.
"You make one move towards my skooma, and I shiv you."
You have wax in your ears? I said no one dies. We're not assassins.
Well guess what... now you've inherited their debt. Don't come back to me until you have every last coin.
"So I've heard. Thanks to you, this should be the last time they forget to pay."
One small detail though - I need all of the gold they gave you. No one skims around here. Come back when you've got every last coin.
"Here's the big picture. He helped Alduin enslave our ancestors. He may have betrayed Alduin in the end, but that makes him worse, not better."
"We can't afford to give Paarthurnax the opportunity to betray us in turn, and return to his old master."
Paarthurnax was the author of many atrocities during the Dragon War - crimes great enough to be remembered for thousands of years.
"True, he turned traitor to Alduin and helped overthrow the Dragon Cult, but that does not excuse or expiate his previous deeds."
"Whether or not he has truly repented, or merely acted to save himself, justice demands that he pay with his life."
Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride[QUOTE]; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.
"I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore."
"Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person."
"Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled down into a ingestible liquid."
"Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person."
"As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests of Vaermina, or the unaffiliated."
"I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago."
But I swear upon Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any harm from befalling you.
"No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the exact liquid the priests would drink."
"The only question in my mind is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a bad aftertaste."
I swear upon Lady Mara that I would never let any harm befall you.
"Have you decided to do the right thing, Dragonborn?"
"I wish there were another way, Dragonborn, but it falls to you to serve justice upon Paarthurnax."
"Make your choice, Dragonborn. You're either with us or against us."
Justice can be harsh. But it is still justice. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
I knew we could count on you! Glad to have you back on our side.
At long last. An ancient evil is avenged. The shades of many Blades salute you this day.
There's one more thing. We know about Paarthurnax.
I'm afraid there's a further problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
"Paarthurnax. The dragon, that the Greybeards have been protecting for all these years."
"He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War."
"That's fine. We needed his help. Now we don't, and it's long past time for him to pay for his crimes."
And he's not just any dragon. He was the right hand of Alduin.
"He committed atrocities so infamous they are still remembered, thousands of years later."
All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities?
"It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years."
He needs to die. He deserves to die. And it falls to you to kill him.
"Until he's dead... well, I'm sorry, but we would dishonor our oaths as Blades if we continued to help you."
"The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by the Greybeards and then the Emperors."
"Justice demands that he die for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort."
"Ah, you're back. I hope you've made some progress on tracking down this Shout we need to defeat Alduin?"
"Ah, indeed? There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think..."
Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there.
One of the mages there may be able to put you on the trail of this Elder Scroll.
"Ah, indeed. Well there's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. I'm sure you'll manage, though."
"Not a single man or woman in Dawnstar has gotten a good night's rest in days. We keep having the same nightmare, over and over."
"If people aren't tired, they're angry, and if they aren't angry, they're afraid. It's made keeping order a mess."
"I hear Mara has sent one of her priests to the inn to try to calm people down, but I don't know how much words will do now."
That's right. Dawnstar. My Dawnstar is plagued with nightmares. I haven't slept properly in days.
That priest of Mara who came here before you says the Divines will cure us.
"Well, until they do, I don't have any business to discuss with outsiders."
You haven't heard? All of Dawnstar hasn't had a decent night's rest in days.
"People are having nightmares they swear are real. They go to bed, but they wake up more tired than yesterday."
"I've heard that a priest of Mara has come, saying that the Divines will lift this curse somehow, but that remains to be seen."
Nightmares. I haven't met a single man or woman who doesn't admit to having them.
"A bad dream I can handle, but everyone having the same bad dream, every night? It's a curse, I say."
I hear there's a priest of Mara visiting the inn. Maybe the Divines will cure us.
It's these nightmares. Me and every one of my workers can't catch a nod without having one.
They're almost... real. They say a priest of Mara has arrived in town. We'll see if faith can cure this curse.
New in town? You're lucky. Dreams aren't affecting travelers.
Everyone else though.... They're horrible. Imagine dying over and over again in your dreams night after night.
They say a priest of Mara is visiting the Windpeak Inn. Says the Divines will take care of everything. We'll see about that.
Everyone here is having nightmares. I have miners tripping over their own feet from lack of sleep.
I heard there was a Priest of Mara who was supposed to be looking into it. We'll see if anything comes of that.
"Go on in, already."
You're a slave. Just like us.
Do you remember the sun? Because you'll forget. Soon.
You're back. Have you done what I asked?
Our vengeance will come.
Remember. It was the Nords who locked you up.
Our struggle is our people's struggle.
They drink all day and night and what do I do?
"Why do they need me to do this?  We use magic, not weapons."
I swear they're making me do this for a laugh. At least I'm not dealing with the prisoners down below.
I bet Naris gets a kick out it. Nasty fella he is.
You work the forge.
"Yeah, I don't know how I feel about what goes on down there."
I work the forge.
You better quiet down before you end up there. Then I'd have to work the forge.
"Ah, the sweet smell of burnt flesh. Nothing better really."
They die too quickly. Maybe I'll try and hold off on the paralysis next time. Give me more of a moving target. Good practice.
"Ask Esbern. If he doesn't know himself, he'll know where to find it out."
"Such blasphemies are the calling of mages, not followers of the Way."
Take your question to the College of Winterhold. They may be able to help you.
Were the Greybeards any help? Did they know this anything about the Shout used against Alduin?
An Elder Scroll? That's not going to be easy to come by.
Esbern's your man for that kind of thing. He may be able to at least point you in the right direction.
I'd be glad to help a friend of Hadvar. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?
"Did he, now? That doesn't sound like my nephew at all. I doubt he'd be mixed up with the likes of you."
"Now that the Imperial blight has poisoned Riften, the worship of Talos is strictly forbidden by the terms of the White-Gold Concordat."
"They can defile our shrine, they can arrest our people and they can silence our voices, but the Empire will never destroy our spirit."
"As long as we keep Talos in our heart, his legacy will never die."
"Mara is the handmaiden of Kyne, the Goddess of the Storm and the Mother of Men."
She is the bearer of love and the patron of marriage.
"If you wish to make a donation to her Benevolence, speak to Maramal and ensure your true love will endure for all eternity."
Such a shame. Perhaps another time then.
"Almost anyone in Riften is in dire need of those missives. Speak to them, child. You will know who will listen and who will sin."
"A word of advice, keep away from the Keep and the city guards. They follow their own path and have already forsaken Her."
Work? I suppose you can call it that. I call it slavery. I work my fingers to the bone keeping this disgusting place clean.
"Ever since my parents died and Haelga took me in, it's been a nightmare. How was I to know she was such a wretched woman?"
So now I'm stuck living here while those pigs she calls customers grope me and say the most awful things.
"It's not just the work, it's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously."
Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing?
"Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it."
"Actually, there is, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out."
"You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella."
"If you confront her with three of the Marks, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do!"
"Oh, this is going to be great!"
"You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best."
Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.
"Yeah, you're right. Maybe it's not the best idea."
What? How... where did you get these?
"No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. Look, we need to keep this quiet... between you and me, okay. No one else needs to know about it."
"If word got out that I'm practicing my Dibellan Arts in Riften, they'll run me out of town."
"Here, take this and don't mention a word of this to anyone, especially Svana!"
Oh I know. Isn't it wonderful? I bet she squirmed like a skeever when you pulled them out of your pocket.
I think things are going to be a lot different around here from now on and I have you to thank for it.
"Here, I want you to have this. It was my father's but I'm certain you'll put it to good use."
"I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd never sleep with anyone besides my good wife, Drifa."
Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.
You're crazy! How dare you make such an accusation!
"Look, it was one night, okay? I think she slipped something in my drink. I haven't even been back to the Bunkhouse since."
Just take this damn thing. I never want to see it again.
"I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes."
If you want the mark that badly then go ahead and take it.
"If word gets around that I bedded her, they'll lose all respect for me at the meadery."
Take the mark if you want it. It's not worth all this hassle anyway.
Hand what over? I have no idea what you're talking about.
"Look, you must have me confused with someone else."
You aren't making any sense. Hand what over?
Or else what? You don't scare me.
You have a death wish or something?
"You're threatening me? Oh, that's rich!"
I should say so.
Next time think before you speak.
You've got some nerve.
"Bolli is a good man, he pays us well and watches out for us."
"I used to work at the Black-Briar Meadery, but Indaryn and I never saw eye-to-eye. That elf has no patience at all."
It's probably for the best anyway; I'm far better at fishing than working in a meadery.
"My job at the Riften Fishery is in danger. The owner, Bolli, said that if I show up for work in this condition one more time, then I'm out."
"I don't mean to do this to myself, but I can't help it. I tried some skooma a year ago, and ever since then, I can't stop!"
"If you could give me a healing potion, I could cleanse this poison from my body and get back to my life."
Your kindness will never be forgotten.
"Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me."
Very well. I suppose I'll just curl up somewhere until this passes as usual.
I can't get it open.
"You've been at it for five minutes. Here, let me try."
I think I almost got it.
"Come on, just open."
We're in this together. Stay close.
This is no time for idle talk.
Not now. Stay alert.
Let's clear the place out first. Then we'll gather our loot.
Eyes open. Danger could be anywhere.
This place is sure to make us rich!
Fool. I should thank you. I knew the girl wouldn't be strong enough to help me kill Gathrik alone.
There's just one more thing I need from you. To fully absorb Gathrik's power I require a blood sacrifice.
Your blood should be good enough. This will go easier for us both if you don't bother fighting back.
"I don't know. Beem-Ja has looked after me since I was knee-high to him. I need to rest, and then I think I'm going back to High Rock."
"Look, I never needed treasure. My father owns land; our family is wealthy. I just wanted adventure. Not this."
Go on without me. I think I need to be alone for a while.
"Thank you, my friend."
Thank you. I'd almost given up hope.
"Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me."
"I'm not sure what it's made from, but I can tell you that once you've had a taste, you'll never crave anything else."
The Dunmer came up with the stuff a long time ago. Very illegal and very hard to come by.
I got mine off of a merchant ship in Solitude. Worst mistake I ever made.
Good. Now get going.
"Yes. I had Falk call you back because you were at the summoning, you have a connection to Potema now. You must deal with her."
I can provide you with help for her minions though.  This should help you deal with the Catacombs themselves.
"What, did you suddenly grow a conscience? Suit yourself."
Let's hope we succeed.
This is our only chance.
"I... I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye doesn't seem to have stopped."
I have no idea what to do!
What's the Jarl going to do about it?
How are we supposed to feel safe in our own homes?
"Please, enough already!"
"I have told Idgrod of your concerns. She'll look after you all. Please, go back to your business."
We've no need for wizards in our midst!
Morthal has enough problems as it is!
"Ah, you saw that, did you?"
"Life in Morthal has been troubled lately. The people are uncertain, restless. They merely look to the Jarl for leadership."
There's news of rebellion against the Empire. Strange noises have been heard in the marshes at night.
"And then, the tragedy with Hroggar's home."
The men simply seek wisdom. Everything will be fine.
"The world's going mad, and our Jarl does what?"
"She hides inside with her 'visions'. We need a leader, not some mystic!"
"The world's going mad, and our Jarl doesn't care. She's only in it for herself."
"If she's the best Ulfric has to offer, we might've been better off with the Imperials."
How can I?
"She never speaks with us. She's allowed this wizard, Falion, to live in our midst practicing gods-know-what."
"And now there's talk of rebellion, and dragons? What help could Idgrod be against them?"
"No, we can only rely on ourselves. You'd do well to remember that."
That is a lot of blood.
Not sure how much longer I can hold out here.
I really got myself into it this time.
"Hello? You! Over here! Please, I need help!"
"Please, do you have a potion you can spare?"
Please! I'm not sure I'll make it on my own.
"Thank Kynareth for you, stranger. I'd almost given up hope of walking away from here."
"You'd do that for a stranger? I don't know what to say. Lead on, I suppose."
"You'd really risk your life for a stranger's honor? I don't even know what to say. Thank you, my friend. I'll wait here."
They're the rulers of the Aldmeri Dominion - what used to be the Imperial provinces of Summerset Isle and Valenwood.
The Thalmor take the arrogance of high elves to the extreme - they believe they are the rightful rulers of all of Tamriel.
"For a century or more, the Thalmor had been picking away at the Empire. Valenwood was the first, then the province of Elsweyr."
"But even the Blades didn't see the Great War coming. We underestimated the Thalmor, and they destroyed us."
They're the high elves that rule the Aldmeri Dominion. Sworn enemies of the Empire and everything it stands for.
"Thirty years ago, they invaded the Empire and came close to destroying it. They smashed the Blades in the process."
"Since then, they've been working to weaken the Empire any way they can."
"We need to find out if the Thalmor are behind the dragons coming back. We need to get into the Thalmor Embassy, somehow..."
"Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the Thalmor."
"Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is."
"So we fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we were more than a match for them. We were wrong."
So you really are...
I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.
"That would be a bad idea. I'd be too likely to attract the wrong kind of attention. But they don't know you at all, yet."
"I've been doing this a long time, remember? While the Thalmor's been looking for me, I've been watching them."
"So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone."
"We're there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. My way is better."
"Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you, but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do."
He's a wood elf - the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges that we never hear about.
"Luckily they don't know who he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's parties."
"Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the guards."
That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party without raising the alarm.
Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the right direction.
Sounds good. Be careful.
You're asking me? She promised that she was sending someone who knew what they were doing...
"If you actually want to get out alive, I'd bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly."
Ah! A fellow latecomer to Elenwen's little soiree.
"And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, sir!"
"And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, my good lady!"
My lateness is due more to getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any desire to actually arrive late.
I prefer to arrive early. Often the day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking.
"There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?"
I will just... rest here a moment. Although it is damnably cold out here. I don't look forward to the trip back down...
Perhaps we might share a carriage after the party?
"I know, I know - we've just met. But think, by the time the party is over we'll no doubt be fast friends. I look forward to it."
Please. Take your time.
Don't mind me. I'm perfectly insensible to the cold.
"I'll go after you. Although these fellows know me. I never miss one of Elenwen's parties, you see."
"Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please."
"Your invitation, please."
You must present your invitation to be admitted to the party.
Go right on in. The party has already started.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm on duty."
"I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty."
We're not supposed to talk to the guests.
The Thalmor Embassy welcomes you.
Please proceed into the Embassy.
Guests are advised to remain inside the Embassy.
"Thank you, sir. Go right in."
"Thank you, ma'am. Go right in."
"Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation."
Of course. Just bring it to me when you find it.
Awful damn cold up here. And only the guests are allowed inside. Damn foreigners and their inhospitable ways.
What are you out here talking to me for? Party's inside.
I'm paid to wait to take you home. Enjoy yourself.
The lady's already paid the fee. We leave when she gives the word.
"Now then. Here's my invitation, I don't have a poisoned dagger strapped to my thigh, et cetera, et cetera."
"I'm just doing my duty, sir."
"Everything's in order. Welcome back, sir."
"Yes, yes. Now to find myself a drink."
"Welcome. I don't believe we've met. I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim."
And you are...?
"Oh, it's you again. What in blazes do you want?"
"If you've got the coin, you're welcome here. Otherwise, hit the road."
What can I get you? Mead? Wine?
Looking for a place to stay?
You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Keerava.
"Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milord. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know."
"Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milady. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know."
Is there something I do for you?
"Be brief Imperial, there's only so long I can stand being downwind of your stench."
Ah! A fellow Nord! I trust you're bringing the fight to the Empire.
"If your allegiance lies with the Empire, we haven't much to discuss."
Hm. You're not from around here. Imperial spy perhaps?
How can a humble servant of Talos help you today?
"Talos bless you, my child."
Blessings of Talos upon you.
"Blessings upon you, traveler."
"Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you much right now... I'm currently in mourning."
You've caught me at a bad time. I've lost someone dear to me.
Yes? What is it?
I'm the brewmaster around here. What did you want?
I'm quite busy. Need something or can I get back to work?
"Yeah? What do you want? If this is about the meadery, we can talk later."
Welcome! Allow me to recommend the Black-Briar Mead... the purest brew in all of Skyrim!
We serve only the best here... Black-Briar Mead. May I get one for you?
I'm off work at the Black-Briar Meadery. I'll be back there in the morning.
"Hey, don't look at me that way! Who are you to judge me?"
So what if I have a problem? I know how to deal with it!
Maramal thinks he's so smart; tells me that Mara will cleanse the filth from my blood. Ha! What does he know?
My n'wah of a father thought he could pull my strings... [QUOTE]continue the Hlaalu tradition.[QUOTE] Bah! I left all that nonsense behind.
"If Indaryn finds out, he'll have me thrown out of the Meadery for certain. So don't breathe a word of it to him. Not a word!"
Oh what am I going do? I can barely afford to stay at the Bunkhouse.
I'm going to stop. That's what I'm going to do! Then everyone will see that I'm not as useless as they think.
A Dreth never forgets a traitor. You'll pay for this!
"Wilhelm was pleased with the delivery, well done."
I believe you have a delivery to make.
You look like you could use a drink. What do you say to some cheap mead?
I'm selling the best mead in town for cheap. Interested?
"Well met. I don't think they're hiring anyone at the moment, so if you're looking for work, you're out of luck."
The trees... they're beautiful here. Reminds me of autumn at home.
The fall forest makes me miss my childhood; playing among the towering trees in Valenwood and living with my brethren.
Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.
I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.
"On his deathbed, my master urged me to take over his business but I decided against it. I chose to wander Tamriel instead."
"Now here I am, working for this dreary city's Fishery. I sometimes wonder why I don't just move on."
Hello. Welcome to the Pawned Prawn.
"If there's anything you need, I'd be glad to help you."
My husband Bersi will be the death of me. He spends too much time worrying about Riften and not enough about himself.
"All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him... and now that we hear rumors about the dragons, he's been very depressed."
Bersi's afraid that someone's making a move to take the Pawned Prawn from us. I think he's being paranoid.
"We both own the Pawned Prawn together, but he's singlehandedly kept the place running despite all our problems."
I just care about my husband so much and I hate to see him in this state.
Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. What can I do for you?
I have all sorts of interesting items for sale. Have you looked around?
"Pickings may be a bit slim today, but if you see anything you like I'll make you a good deal."
"If you're looking for anything to sell for a fair price, I run the Pawned Prawn over by the market."
I presume you're bothering me for a good reason?
What in the name of Oblivion do you want?
I don't have time for idle chit-chat. What is it?
"The throne suits me, don't you think?"
My title is just a formality. I've always been in charge around here.
"Jarl Maven Black-Briar. Has a pleasant sound to it, wouldn't you say?"
"Fancy yourself the adventuring type, eh? It's just as well, I doubt your combat prowess would prove valuable in a real battle anyway."
I was trained by some of the finest warriors in all Skyrim to wield a blade as if it was an extension of my own arm.
My mother spares no expense where I'm concerned. I'm heir to the family fortune after all.
Once I'm in charge I have bigger aspirations than just Skyrim. I plan to bring Black-Briar Mead to all of Tamriel.
"My children, Sibbi and Ingun, are being groomed to run the family business one day as well."
"Sibbi will prove to be a fine leader one day, but Ingun... that girl has her mind somewhere other than business."
"Maven's disappointed that Ingun's heart isn't in the family business, but she says [QUOTE]Ingun still has her uses.[QUOTE] Not sure what that means."
I'm Riften's appointed Steward. How can I help you?
Steward Hemming Black-Briar at your service.
"Well, if it isn't my little problem-solver."
"Well, well. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I've always got time for lovely ladies."
Have you come to gawk at me or is this a social call?
"Ah finally, someone besides the stupid guards to talk to."
My experiments continue to go well thanks to you. How can I return the favor?
Any luck gathering those ingredients?
"Hm? Sorry, just thinking about my experiments."
My mind is on my experiments today. What did you need?
What was it you wanted?
"Welcome back to the temple, messenger."
Blessings of Mara upon you!
"How may I help you, my son?"
"How may I help you, my daughter?"
"Lady Mara's messenger returns. What can I help you with, my child?"
Has the Warmth of Mara been given to Riften?
Lady Mara bids you welcome to Her Benevolence.
"What is it you seek, my child?"
Visiting Riften? All are welcome at the Temple of Mara.
"Please to meet you, I'm a priestess at the Temple of Mara."
Thanks again for the delivery to Markarth. What can I do for you?
Did you get that purchase agreement to Markarth yet?
"New in town, eh? Here for the fishing I'd guess."
"There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich, you should try it sometime."
"If you're hungry, Marise sells fresh fish... caught by yours truly."
"If you're looking for a handout, you're not going to get one from me."
Can you believe my former husband used to give most of our gold to the poor?
"If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband."
"If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband. If you're looking for company, I suppose I could do worse."
"Bolli's around somewhere, planning to feed the poor with his nonsense about Mara."
"With my husband's new found religion, what I do with our coin and what I do all day seem less important to him. Suits me."
"At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?"
"Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something."
"I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!"
"Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry."
I'm feeling much better thanks to your efforts.
"The pilgrimage is complete, I can feel it."
Anything else before you make the journey?
Come to laugh at the grave tender?
I can see that disapproving look in your eye.
"Oh, it's you. Come to extort more from me?"
New around Riften? Take my advice. Stay at the Bee and Barb... the Bunkhouse isn't for you.
"If you're looking for a bed, this is the wrong place."
You looking for something or what?
Hey! Good to see you again.
Any luck getting the marks from those men?
Sorry about the mess. Keeping this place clean is quite a chore.
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands to yourself.
The Bunkhouse isn't an inn. I'd recommend the Bee and Barb.
Who did this to me?
This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt!
This is unfair! I'm innocent!
Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?
Have anything you wish to sell? I pay fair prices for all sorts of goods.
"If there's anything you wish to purchase, just let me know."
"If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands."
"Working at the Riften Fishery is tough, but it puts some coin in my pocket."
I'm beginning to think leaving Mournhold was a mistake.
"If Riften is the best Skyrim has to offer, I may as well turn back right now and just head for home."
"Welcome to Riften, traveler. I hope the road fared well for you."
What can I do for you?
"Speak, I wish to hear everything my subjects have to say."
"I feel so helpless out here. The people of Riften depended on me, and I failed them."
"Unmid and Anuriel shouldn't blame themselves for Riften's fall, I am the one who's ultimately responsible."
"If Riften can be retaken, I will redouble my efforts to ensure the safety of my subjects and the defense of the Rift."
Out of my way. The son of the Jarl has no time for idle conversation with travelers.
"If this isn't about official city business, you're wasting my time."
I presume you have something important to say?
"Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?"
I can feel you laughing behind my back.
Did Harrald send you to taunt me?
"Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel."
"As Riften's Steward I'm afraid I can provide only limited assistance, but speak your mind."
"If you're here to report any instances of corruption, be confident that we're handling these rumors accordingly."
I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end.
The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne.
Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.
"As Jarl Laila's housecarl, I would ask that you maintain a respectable distance from her at all times."
Did you have some sort of official business here?
"I'd request that when speaking to Jarl Laila, you show the proper respect."
Being in exile is the most humiliating thing I've experienced in my life.
I killed scores of the Empire's men before I was forced to surrender.
"The only reason I stopped fighting was a plea from Laila, otherwise I'd would have fought to the death."
I know you. Where was it? Hm. Oh! You were getting something for me?
Did we have an appointment? No... it was a delivery? I can't remember.
"Excuse my disorganization, but I'm in the middle of some delicate experiments."
"Come to see Balimund perform miracles with steel, eh?"
What brings you to Balimund today? Repair? Purchase?
"Nothing like the smell of a white-hot blade, eh?"
Looking for some armor? A weapon perhaps?
Here to purchase some armor or a weapon?
How can I help you today?
Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.
I used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.
"Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him."
"At first I don't know why he picked me. I never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!"
Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that some day and make him proud of me.
Welcome back! Good to see you again.
"Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?"
"Oh, it's you. Not here to rob me are you?"
"Well met, friend. How can I help you?"
"You're a stranger here too, eh?"
Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.
I've never seen Mjoll this upset about anything. The city really gets to her.
Mjoll told me that it isn't this bad everywhere. Maybe one day I'll venture out and see if she's right.
Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and piece of mind... and some lessons with the blade.
I hope that someday this city will be free from corruption and we can all live in peace.
You here for lessons like Ingun? Or did you wish to buy something?
Do you have any idea how busy I am? My mixture could be burning as we speak!
"Take a look at my supplies if you must, but do hurry... I'm not getting any younger you know!"
Thanks again for delivering that ore sample.
Have you managed to make it out to Shor's Stone?
"This place has seen better days, but it's not my fault."
Where's my head? I never even greeted you properly.
I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.
"Please, please. I need but a septim. A septim is all I ask. Is that so bad?"
"I can't take this place anymore. The trees... all the colors, but the city, so dark. Why? It makes no sense."
"So cold, so hungry, so tired."
No one cares about us! No one! We could die and no one would ever even know! They'd just throw our corpses in the canal!
"Are you scared of death? I am. I hear everything just stops... forever. It just all goes away, but you don't realize it. I don't want to die."
"Sure, sure. I'm a dirty beggar... why would you want to even speak to me."
To Oblivion with all of you! You rich piles of dung walking by us like we're not there! Pretending we don't exist! How dare you!
"You think you know pain? Do you!? Try watching your wife and daughter burn alive after they've been ravaged by brigands! That's pain, my friend."
"Edda... she's crazy as a loon, but at least she doesn't have the mind to realize what a horrible world this is. She's the lucky one."
"Just leave Riften. Go far, far away and never return. This place is nothing but a rotten, stinking corpse that's sat in the sun far too long."
"Greetings, honored friend. Could I interest you in some fine jewelry?"
"If anything pleases the eye, don't hesitate to make me an offer."
"If you have any jewelry to sell, I'd be glad to pay you a fair sum in gold for it."
Come see me in the market if you're looking for the finest custom jewelry in all of Skyrim.
"So, you're Brynjolf's new protege, eh? Don't look like much to me."
It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.
It's been a long time since anyone joined us. Seems like people are in a rush to leave.
I hear even the simple jobs are becoming difficult. It never used to be like this.
Less coin in everyone's pocket means less coin in mine.
Something has to change soon or I may as well pack this place up and leave it for the skeevers.
You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.
Got a lot of nerve coming down here. People tend to get hurt in the Ratway.
I wouldn't stay here long if I were you.
There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.
Don't make trouble or else I'll ask Dirge to [QUOTE]walk[QUOTE] you out.
"Even if you're one of us, you better not make trouble."
I don't care if you're best buddies with the Guild Master. I'll still smash in your skull if you try anything.
The last person that made trouble for Vekel ended up floating in the canal... catch my drift?
"Stay outta trouble, or there's gonna be trouble."
Last person who made trouble for Vekel ended up with a smashed head.
Vekel doesn't like strangers snooping around the Flagon.
There's two things to do at the Flagon: spend coin and then get out.
If it isn't the best brawler in Skyrim. Good to see you again!
You up for another wager?
"Back, eh? Ready to brawl?"
"Too lazy to walk, eh? Well, you've found the right place."
"Got horses that need shoeing, so make it quick."
"If it's horses you want, you're talking to the right person."
"If it's horses you want, I'm not sure I can help you. I have too much on my mind as it is."
"If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir at the stables."
"If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir. I'm afraid I'm in too much trouble to help you."
Hofgrir is a great teacher. I've learned so much about horses from him.
Horses are all I know. I've been riding since I could walk.
"If the forest wasn't so dangerous, I'd spend every spare moment riding."
"When Aventus escaped, Grelod got meaner than ever. I really thought she was going to kill one of us. Guess not!"
"Please, mister. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us."
"Please, lady. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us."
"I used to hate it here, but it's not so bad anymore. Constance is real good to us."
It's too bad the orphanage ain't letting us kids get adopted. I'd be the best son ever.
I was named after the sound a lion makes. You know: rrroooaaaarr! Really.
I can't believe it! Grelod is dead! She's really dead!
"I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, Grelod has been so angry."
"I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, this place has gone mad."
My parents dropped me off here a year ago. But they're coming back to get me. They said so.
You look kind of scary. But nobody is scarier than old Grelod.
Constance Michel says we have to be careful of people we don't know.
"I'm really afraid of Grelod. When Aventus escaped, she was so mad. I got double the beatings that day."
"Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities."
"When Aventus escaped, Grelod was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. But that won't happen ever again."
I hate it here. Grelod the Kind is the meanest person in all of Skyrim.
"Things are much better now that Grelod is dead, but still. I'm sick of this place."
"I'm strong, and quick, and can do any chore you want. Come on, adopt me. Please?"
"When Aventus took off, when he said those things, about killing Grelod... I never imagined he was serious..."
Come to get yourself a kid? You're out of luck. No way Grelod will let any of us get adopted. Especially not since Aventus took off.
Grelod ain't going to like some stranger just hangin' around. Not that I care.
"Constance don't care much for strangers in the orphanage. Afraid someone might hurt one of us kids. Which, I gotta admit, is kind of nice."
Why's someone like you want to hang around a place like this?
Grelod... murdered. Here. I... I need... air... You... you... Get out of here! Get out!
"I can't believe Grelod is dead. I had no love for the woman, but to be murdered, in cold blood..."
You really shouldn't be in here.
"I'm sorry, but the children aren't up for adoption right now. You should go."
My only concern is for the children. The poor darlings have no one else.
Welcome to the cozy little family. I'm one of the lookouts for the Guild. I watch Delvin's back.
"If you're looking for extra work, talk to Vex or Delvin. They'll fix you up."
"Stick to the rules and you'll end up rich. Break them and you're out on your arse. Simple, right?"
"If you're looking for conversation, The Flagon isn't the place."
"Vekel and me, we have a thing going. So I recommend you keep your hands off the merchandise."
"Vekel and me, we have a thing going. Try anything with him and it'd be bad for your health."
You don't impress me. So don't even try.
"You going to buy something or just here for training? Otherwise, move on."
You gonna stare all day or buy some armor?
"Come on, come on. The sooner you buy, the sooner I can get drunk."
Can't you bother me at my armor stand in the market? Or are you that desperate for training?
My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.
Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?
The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.
I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.
I'm feeling much better now thanks to you.
Did you bring anything? The pain...
"Please help me, I'm going to lose my job at the Riften Fishery."
I really need your help! I don't want to lose my job at the fishery! What am I going to do?
"Oh, my aching head. Why do I do this to myself?"
"You have no idea what it's like to have everything, then watch it all disappear."
"Let me out of here, damn it! I'm not a criminal!"
This is what happens to you when you speak your mind in this city.
They threw me in here because I called Ulfric a liar; a deceiver.
Ulfric doesn't care about Talos. He yearns for the throne of Skyrim and he'll say anything to rally people to his side.
"But now, because of Ulfric's greed, countless lives have been lost."
"On second thought, maybe I'm better off in here. At least I'll die with a clear conscience."
Brynjolf sent you to rub it in?
"Waste of talent throwing me in here, right?"
Can't wait to get out of here.
What? What are you looking at?
Piss off. I'm busy.
Get away from me.
"A pleasure, thane."
Is it daylight out? Night? I lose track down here.
"The prisoners are in rare form, as usual."
Watch your step in here. The stonework gets slippery.
"Now that the Empire's arrived in Riften, we've finally established a launching point into Morrowind... just in case."
"So is it Riften or Rifton? This place has changed its name so many times, I can't even remember."
Seems like capturing Riften is turning out to be more of a hassle than a benefit. But what do I know?
Why we bothered to capture Riften I'll never understand. Just look at this place.
This city still reeks with the stench of the Stormcloaks. Makes me sick to my stomach.
"I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane."
"I trust the day's found you well, thane."
"How do you do, thane?"
"You could say the Ratway is the city under the city. Dark, dangerous, and no place for decent folk."
"Riften's under my protection. You watch yourself, now."
Careful. Riften's not the safest place for a nighttime stroll.
"City's quiet enough now. But when the sun goes down, you best keep on your guard."
"There's an apothecary in town, yeah. But it's down on the lower walkway, so stay sharp if you go down there."
"There's fine steel at the Scorched Hammer, if you fancy a new blade."
"Need a drink, you go to the Bee and Barb. Stay out of the Ragged Flagon, stay out of the Ratway."
"If it's a bed you need, talk to Keerava in the Bee and Barb. She'll set you right."
"There's a foul presence coming from Darklight Tower, southwest of the city. Some say the place is home to necromancers."
"City got attacked once by those damn bandits, come east across the lake, from Faldar's Tooth. They won't be trying that again."
Best not go wandering east of the city. Bandits been seen around Broken Helm Hollow.
"Talk of strange happenings at Autumnshade Clearing, just north of the lake. My guess? Spriggans."
"If you journey north, keep well away from Snapleg Cave. Damned Hagravens have infested the place."
"By the gods, a dragon's been sighted just south of the city, flying around Lost Tongue Overlook."
"Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and my gut's telling me that demented little fool is up to something."
"Of course nothing in here is stolen. Only a careless, shameful, idiotic fetcher would do something as stupid as to buy pilfered goods...."
"Oh by Azura, I've made a terrible mistake. I bought a gold ring, and Viola Giordano has been missing a ring that looks just like it."
It's not that easy. She'd go to the Jarl if she knew I was even remotely involved. You have to get it to her some other way.
"Look, it's dangerous, but if you sneak the ring into her house. Put in a dresser or something. I will make it worth your while."
You're telling me.
Thank you. Thank you! Azura's Prophecy always guide you to fortune.
Speaking of fortune. Here. Everything I earned from my last shipment. It's yours.
"Oh, really? So that Dark Elf took my ring. So typical of his kind."
"I think the Jarl should hear about this. Maybe double his taxes. No, triple them. That should teach those people a lesson."
You deserve something for sniffing out that thief. Here.
"If you're one of the Jarl's men, you'll get your lumber. Anga's Mill pays its debts."
I'm a writer by trade. Not that the people of Skyrim do much reading.
"Sorry, I thought Skald the Elder sent you. We've got an order to fill, and he's not known for patience."
"Look, if you're heading towards Dawnstar anytime soon, can you give the Jarl this note? Let him know he'll get his lumber."
"Falkreath is known for its graveyard, traveler. We've buried more dead than you can imagine."
"I just finished giving my old war companion, Berit, a proper burial by fire. Old hard head hated the idea of being lost cold in the ground."
"Could you deliver the ashes to Runil, the priest of Arkay? He'll know the right blessings to make for Berit's soul."
"I write drama, friend. The legends and history of Skyrim made to excite and inspire."
"Poor Giruad Gemane at the Bards College has been waiting for my latest work, [QUOTE]Olaf and the Dragon,[QUOTE] for weeks now. Roads are a mess."
My family has been doing it for years. You need one out in the Reach. Don't want to be alone when some Forsworn comes swinging.
"I personally trained a whole litter for the Jarl. That reminds me, I was going to deliver some dog food to the Keep. Spiced beef. Their favorite."
"This mine is only a few years old, but I've been digging up ore for over a century."
We're getting to the point where the tunnels are getting deep into the rock. People complain of bad coughs and foul air.
I've seen this before. We need some medicines to combat the ore dust. I was about to send a message to Windhelm for aid.
My brother is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things.
"We were taking him to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine."
"Are you heading to Whiterun? Could you take this letter to the priestess, Danica Pure-Spring? It's a note about Joric's health."
Thanks.
Thank you.
"You're sure? When you see Giruad, ask for a tip. I'm sure he'll be in a good mood after reading this."
"Well, look at you, thanks. Take it to Voada, she handles all the dogs for the Jarl."
"Thank you. Take it to Quintus, in the White Phial."
Thank you.
Fair enough.
Indeed it is.
"Yeah, yeah."
Typical.
We'll get by.
Very well.
"What's this? Oh, that's right, the timbers from Anga's Mill."
"I swear, that Aeri and her men would make fine Stormcloak recruits. Pity we can't spare the lumber to conscript them."
Here. Take this. For your time and all that.
"Oh, thank you. The dogs were getting restless."
"Here, this is for you."
"Ah, Berit's ashes. He was a good man. Not many warriors grow to a fine, old age."
"Thank you for bringing this to me. I'll make sure he gets his rites. Here, for your trouble."
"Ah yes, Adonato's new work. Shorter than I expected, but words must be judged on merit, not length."
"I'll look over this later. Why don't you take this, for your trouble?"
Oh dear. Darkwater Crossing needs medicines for its miners?
"I'll see about getting this order filled right away. Here, a few septims for you."
Joric's sister? Poor child. Magic runs deep in that family's bloodline. It's not always a blessing.
Thank you for this. Something for your trouble.
"So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous."
You must understand. If Cicero is turning the others against me... against us... Our Family would not survive such division.
"Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen! Now go! Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn."
They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide inside? Now go. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
"No objections, then? Good. Go now. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn."

"You must speak with Astrid. Here, in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary."
"Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, he's in there!"
"Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, she's in there!"
"I'm going... as fast... as I can, you stupid she-devil. I don't see you... helping..."
"I'm not exactly built for manual labor. Now come on, you've almost got it."
One more... pull...
Yeeaahh! There.
Can you get it open?
I think so. Just hold on a moment.
We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered.
Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I adore this location... we have no idea what we're going to find.
"And if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy coincidence."
What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?
Try casting a spell at the wall. See what happens!
There must be something about that amulet. Have you tried putting it on?
Looks like the boss is at it again.
Why? What's he doing now?
He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole.
"We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone that looks crooked at him."
Someone should let that cat lose.  That'd shut him up real quick.
"Don't say that to loud, you don't want it getting back to him."
Forgive me. I was... intemperate. I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty.
The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.
I have given my answer. Go and reconsider your course.
"So the Blades have survived yet another disaster of their own making, and continue to meddle in things they do not understand."
"You're tougher than you look. You got me, fair and square."
I didn't mean nothing by it! Just... leave me alone! What do you want?
Wind guide you.
Sky guard you.
Breath and focus.
Go away! Leave me alone!
Very good.
"That's all, hmm?"
Goodbye then.
Su'um ahrk morah.
"Lok, Thu'um."
Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in someone who may be dead tomorrow.
"If you're still breathing in a few weeks, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends."
"Ooh, cocky."
I give you three days before you screw up and someone runs a knife across your throat.
But who knows? I've been proven wrong before.
"Ahh, going for the mysterious and brooding thing, hmm?"
"That may work for your targets, but you'll find I'm not so easily impressed."
True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues.
Vahrukt unslaad... perhaps none but me now remember how he was defeated.
This is the most sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain of the world.
"Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him."
"Drem. Patience. I am answering, in my way."
"Yes and no. Viik nuz ni kron. Alduin was not truly defeated, either. If he was, you would not be here today, seeking to... defeat him."
The Nords of those days used the Dragonrend Shout to cripple Alduin. But this was not enough. Ok mulaag unslaad.
It was the Kel - the Elder Scroll. They used it to... cast him adrift on the currents of Time.
Tiid krent. Time was... shattered here because of what the ancient Nords did to Alduin.
"If you brought that Kel, that Elder Scroll back here... to the Tiid-Ahraan, the Time-Wound..."
"With the Elder Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to... cast yourself back. To the other end of the break."
You could learn Dragonrend from those who created it.
Vomindok. I do not know. Perhaps in the very doing they erased the knowing of it from Time itself.
The dov are children of Akatosh. Thus we are specially... attuned to the flow of Time. Perhaps also uniquely vulnerable.
I warned them against such a rash action. Even I could not foresee its consequences. Nust ni hon. They would not listen.
Yes. There were a few of us that rebelled against Alduin's thur... his tyranny. We aided the humans in his overthrow.
But they did not trust us. Ni ov. Their inner councils were kept hidden from us.
I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all dov felt the... sundering of Time itself.
Krosis. No. I know little of what has passed below in the long years I have lived here.
You are likely better informed than I.
Evenaar bahlok. There are many hungers it is better to deny than to feed.
Dreh ni nahkip. Discipline against the lesser aids in qahnaar... denial of the greater.
Watch it!
Ouch! Hey!
Hey!
Oh.
What the?
Whoops.
Mind yourself.
What's the hurry?
Oaf.
Woah!
Excuse me.
"Uh, sorry."
Mind the way.
Careful!
"Perhaps not. But this Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again."
Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?
"Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it."
"If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn."
Not hate. Distrust and fear. The Blades have always sought to turn the Dragonborn away from the path of wisdom.
"That may be what you are here for, Dragonborn."
But stopping Alduin is one thing. Helping you wipe out dragons again is quite another.
"Dragons are part of the natural order of the world. The Blades thought to change the order to suit themselves, by wiping out the dragons."
"But again, we see that the natural order will be restored, one way or another."
Perhaps we would have dragon allies against Alduin if the ancient Blades had not acted so arrogantly.
The Dragonrend Shout is evil. Would you cure one evil with another?
The Blades! Of course. They specialize in meddling in matters they barely understand. Their reckless arrogance knows no bounds.
"Tell me. Why do you come here, volaan? Why do you intrude on my meditation?"
The Blades were born of dragon-hating crusaders. They still carry that legacy although they may not remember from whence it came.
"They carried out a genocide of dragons when they first came to Tamriel, and now they will do it again, with your help."
It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty of Alduin's Dragon Cult.
"Their whole lives were consumed with hatred for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this Shout."
"When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In a sense, you become the Shout."
"In order to learn and use this Shout, you will be taking this evil into yourself."
Your kind - joorre - mortals - created it as a weapon against the dov... the dragons.
"Our hadrimme, our minds cannot even... comprehend its concepts."
"Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way."
"If you wish to stand alone, so be it. If you wish for our help, you'll answer my question."
They have always sought to turn the Dragonborn from the path of wisdom.
"Have you learned nothing from us? Would you simply be a tool in the hands of the Blades, to be used for their own purposes?"
"Do not be so sure about that. Beware - the Blades may claim to serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have."
"As for me, I kept from you only what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not ready to know, as your question reveals."
"Keep moving, stay focused on your goal, and you will reach the summit."
"So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a joor... mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood."
What would you ask of me?
"Not until introductions are complete. Zin. Heyv. Test your Thu'um against mine, Dovahkiin!"
"Drem Yol Lok. Greetings, wunduniik. I am Paarthurnax."
Who are you? What brings you to my strunmah... my mountain?
"You are bold, wunduniik. You dare enter a Dovah's home without permission."
I am as my father Akatosh made me. As are you... Dovahkiin.
They see me as master. Wuth. Onik. Old and wise. It is true I am old...
"Yes. Vahzah. You speak true, Dovahkiin. Forgive me."
It has been long since I held tinvaak with a stranger. I gave in to the temptation to prolong our speech.
"Drem. Patience. There are formalities which must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dov."
Point that somewhere else!
"Don't do that, it's mean!"
You have a death wish?
Careful there!
That's a dangerous game you're playing.
Woah... watch it!
I suggest you aim elsewhere.
Please! Don't shoot!
Hmm? What're you doing?
Now that's just rude.
"You're not going to shoot, right?"
There's no need for that.
Don't be a fool.
I'll let you live. This time.
I'll spare you - for now.
"All right, you've had enough."
You're not worth it.
I didn't think you had the stomach for it.
"The door up ahead will be locked. Klotha, one of the hagravens, will have the key on her."
Watch out for pressure plates here.
"Considering most of us are now dead, I assumed as much."
"And before you ask, no - I don't think it was you. Well, maybe I did, but you saving my sorry hide just now sort of erased any doubts."
So thanks.
You've got that right. Only a matter of time before we're roasted alive. Come on!
Listener. I am your only salvation. Come. Embrace me.
"This is Markarth, traveler. Safest city in the Reach."
"You here to see the Jarl? No sudden moves, understand?"
Whole dwarven city underneath the keep. Nchuand-Zel. Best steer clear if you don't want a Steam Centurion carving you up.
"By the Hist, if I don't get something soon, I don't know how I'll get through the week."
No. I'm not. I feel like my scales are clawing into me. Maybe you could help an old Argonian out?
I heard some of the sailors talking about how they stashed a bottle of Double-Distilled Skooma in the Gnisis Cornerclub. I just need a taste.
"Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me."
Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth.
It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College.
Not against me. Against all of Falkreath. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us.
Last night I saw Lod the blacksmith writing a letter. Probably sending word to Solitude and General Tullius.
Are you loyal to Skyrim? Break into Lod's house and get that letter.
Thank you. I'll be waiting for that bottle.
Thanks. I'll be waiting for it.
Good.
Hist spit on you.
"Daedra take you, then."
Milk drinker.
Thank you so much. Here. Let me show you a thing or two about not attracting attention to yourself.
This should come in handy. Here. Let me show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.
What's this? Some kind of code? [QUOTE]Need as much iron ore as you can dig up....[QUOTE]
"He's not spying, but it's clear the Empire is making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them."
Good work. Take this.
How's business today?
"Well enough, I suppose. Nilsine bought up most of the tomatoes, and was asking if we could get more."
We've got another dozen ripening on the vine. They should be ready in a few days.
I'll be sure to tell her.
Did you have any luck tracking own some more pitchforks?
"Revyn put the word out to his suppliers but with the war on, tools are scarce. Both sides have been snapping them up."
"Tell him I'll pay double the normal price. We've been getting by with one broken pitchfork, but it's falling apart."
I'll be sure to stress your urgency. It seems like every farmer in Skyrim is short on supplies these days.
"Hello, Jora. I'm glad to see you. In fact, I was just thinking about you and your husband."
"Is that so? And what were you thinking, exactly?"
"Well, I've heard awful stories about these Thalmor, and how they're rounding up everyone who still worships Talos."
"The interrogations are quite merciless, from what I've heard."
"I fear for you and your husband, should the Thamlor come here. But perhaps there's a way I can help."
"I doubt Ulfric would let Thalmor into Windhelm without a fight. But please, do continue. How would you help us?"
"Well, let's just say that I know some people who are experts at helping others disappear when they need to."
"They are discreet and thorough, though not inexpensive. I hope you'll keep that in mind, should the worst come to pass."
"We accept the risks that come with our faith, but I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you, Niranye."
I wanted to thank you again for the mince pie you sent over. It was delicious.
"It was my pleasure, Torbjorn. I enjoy cooking, and after what you and Tova have been through, it was the least I could do."
"My little Friga loved to cook, but she was terrible at it. Then one day, out of nowhere, she made the most amazing leek soup."
"She watched while we ate it, and when she saw how much we loved it, she was... so proud..."
"I... I'm so sorry, Torbjorn. You must be suffering terribly. I wish there was some way I could help."
"You've done more than enough already. You've been a good friend in a time of need, and we won't forget that."
I'm sorry I lost myself for a moment there. I just need some time to get over the loss.
"I've been meaning to speak to you, Niranye. Rumor is, you've got ties to the Thieves' Guild."
"One should never pay too much attention to rumors, Torbjorn."
"You have piqued my curiosity, however. Please, do continue."
"It's a bad time to be a criminal, what with these murders going on."
"In fact, thieves have been known to kill, if there's a profit in it. This war's been hard on all of us."
"Not that I'd know anything about it, of course, but it seems to me that the last thing a thieves' guild would want is to draw attention to itself."
The eyes of the law are everywhere these days.
"The guards are looking for a killer, but who knows what else they might turn up? Good day."
"I understand you purchase used goods, as well as sell them?"
"Yes, that's right. Whether or not I'm interested depends on what you've got, of course."
"I have some things that belonged to my daughter, Friga. She... she won't be needing them any more."
"Oh, I see. Yes, yes of course I'll take a look. Just bring them by whenever it's convenient for you."
"Captain Lonely-Gale, it's always a pleasure to see you."
"In fact, I'm glad you're here. There's something I'd like to ask you."
"A pleasure to see you as well, Niranye. What can I do for you?"
I was wondering if you still had many associates in the shipping profession.
I have a business proposition for any sailors who might be looking to make a few extra septims.
"If that business proposition includes smuggling, forget it."
The sailors I know are plenty good at finding trouble without any help from you.
"You're such a wet blanket, captain. Can't a girl have a little fun from time to time?"
"Is that new batch of tomatoes ready for sale yet, Hillevi?"
"You know, I'm not sure. My husband's been tending to the vines, so I'll have to ask him."
"Just promise me when you get some more in, I'll have the first crack at them."
"What is it Ulfric's always saying... [QUOTE]On my honor as a Nord, I swear it.[QUOTE] (Laughter)."
So serious! (Laughter)
"Friend Brunwulf, how good to see you!"
"If you see anything you like, just let me know and I'll glad offer you a discount."
That's not necessary. I'll pay the same price as anyone else.
But I insist. and with good reason.
Malthyr told me that you've been speaking to Ulfric about our situation. He said you're going to help us.
"So few Nords have ever offered to help us, a discount is the least I can do."
"I'm not looking for special treatment, Aval. All I did was talk to Ulfric."
"For all I know, he's already forgotten the conversation. I wouldn't get your hopes up."
"Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry to have troubled you about it."
Just... know that your efforts are appreciated.
Why are you here? Get away from me!
By the gods! Somebody help me!
Who are you? What do you want?
"Please, just... just leave me be!"
"I'm really not in the mood. State your business, or take your leave."
"I'm busy, and you're bothering me. So go away."
You fighter types are always underfoot. You want me to clean? Then scat!
I really must get back to my duties. This fort isn't going to clean itself.
You're making me... nervous. Is there something you need?
I find your presence... unnerving. Please depart.
Hrm. You go find your own wreck. This one's mine.
Go away! This is my wreck! Mine!
"Yes, yes. What is it? We're all very busy here..."
"By the love of the Nine, what is it with you sycophants and hangers on? The jarl is busy! And so am I, for that matter."
"What next, giant snakes?"
"I hate those damn things. Too many eyes, you know?"
"No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up."
"No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up."
Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?
"You really don't want to be loitering here, stranger."
"Is the line for my next performance starting already? Come on, don't be shy. Plenty of room for everyone."
"I'm in the mood to ssssiiiiinnnggg! What about you, friend? Care to join me?"
They burned his body before I could raise him... it should have been returned to me...
"Keep digging! Ugh... If Lu'ah Al-Skaven can raise an army of Draugr, then why do I have to babysit them?"
Gah!
Nargh!
Unf!
Grrh!
Nnh!
"Not quite good enough, are you?"
Close...
You'll need to do better than that.
Easily blocked!
Oho! Not so fast!
By the gods! What are you doing here?
The power of Mzinchaleft is mine! Begone from here!
"And how may Ma'randru-jo assist you, hmm?"
Purchase something or leave. Those are your options.
Let me guess - you have some [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] to discuss...
You do realize there's only one way this can end.
Thank you so much for taking care of those thieves. The Riverwood Trader is back to the way it used to be!
Thanks for bringing the claw back.
It means so much to us to have the claw back where it belongs. Thank you!
Thanks for bringing the claw back.
"Brynjolf, have you had a chance to speak to our contact in Whiterun?"
"Sorry Mercer, they no longer wish to be involved in our operation."
I trust you've applied the appropriate pressure in order to change their mind?
I have. I think we may have to turn this one over to the Dark Brotherhood.
"Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Such a shame..."
Maven has been nagging us about her request. Any thoughts?
"Do we have anyone reliable to send out there? I don't want to look the fool again in front of her, Brynjolf."
"Yes, I know. That last job was my fault. I obviously thought Niruin was ready, but I was wrong."
Remind me why we even bother to allow him to be a part of the Guild.
Two reasons. He's rich and because we need every sword we can get right now.
I think we need to prepare for the worst. The coffers are dwindling and I can barely keep our contacts happy.
There's no need to be concerned. We've been through more difficult times than this.
"Normally I'd agree, but we've already lost so many contacts across Skyrim. If we lose the ones in Riften, we may as well close up shop."
I'll speak to the Jarl and see what I can do. Just keep them at bay a little longer.
"Delvin, please tell me you have good news."
"If I told you that, I'd be lying. We haven't had a bite in weeks. Our clients are starting to get angry."
You tell this sorry bunch of thieves that they need to put down their flagons and get to work if they want to keep their status!
"I will, I will..."
"So, Thrynn, you were a bandit, huh?"
"Yeah, what of it?"
"So is it true, bandits get... you know, real friendly with the wildlife?"
You're an idiot.
"So, what do you think, my dear? Could a beautiful woman like you ever see yourself with an old codger like me?"
Absolutely.
"Oh, really? Well then... how can I make that happen?"
When you're in your grave and I'm standing over it. Now get out of my way!
"Delvin, that last shipment we heisted on the Cyrodiil frontier was worthless!"
That's impossible. I distinctly heard that lout in the tavern say it was a full shipment of furs. They should be worth a fortune.
You idiot. He said [QUOTE]firs[QUOTE] not [QUOTE]furs.[QUOTE] It was a damn logging caravan!
"Oh my... umm, you won't let Mercer hear about this will you? Ahem."
"I've picked up some new clients and did a few jobs on my own, but I'm not sure if that will cover our expenses."
"Thank you, Vex. You've always been the most reliable one in the Guild."
"Well, what the hell is Mercer going to do about this mess? Have you even talked to him?"
"Mercer is being Mercer. If he has a plan to get us out of this rut, then he isn't sharing it with me."
"How are you feeling, Vex?"
Pretty angry actually. I can't believe I botched the Goldenglow job. That should have been like stealing a sweetroll from a baby.
"Well, I see your wounds have healed but your pride still needs some time."
"Brynjolf, something stinks around here and it's more than just the Ratway. We all know it. The question is, what's Mercer going to do about it?"
"Hold a moment, Rune. What did you think about my idea?"
"Your idea to start a brothel, right? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I think?"
"Well, yes! Please!"
"I think if Brynjolf catches wind of it, he'll boot you right out of here... so drop it already!"
What in the name of Oblivion is going on in this place?
"Yeah, I know what you mean. If things don't start getting better soon, I may look for work elsewhere."
"Hey, I still have a contact in Valenwood that may have some work for us. You're welcome to join me."
I'll keep that in mind.
"I tried to fence some goods to Tonilia, and you know what she told me?"
"I think I know, but go ahead."
She said that she barely had enough coin to cover it and I should come back later. Can you imagine that?
This place is getting worse and worse.
"So, Sapphire. Can I do anything for you, or more to the point... to you?"
Vipir [QUOTE]the Fleet.[QUOTE] The only man who's foolish enough to name himself after his bedroom prowess.
You stupid cow. You don't know what you're missing.
"No, but I know that you're going to turn up missing if you keep up this kind of talk."
You seem to be a bit closer to Brynjolf than the rest of us. Is he giving you any idea why this place seems to be falling apart?
"If he does, he isn't telling me a thing. I've asked, but all I get from him are more questions."
What about Mercer? Have you asked him?
"No, and I'm not about to either. I value my life you know... you may want to remember that for yourself."
All right. I have everything you asked for all ready to go.
I hope this deal goes through. I'm putting quite a bit of coin on the line... and the last two you set up fell through.
"I don't understand it either. They were a sure thing, I swear."
You just better hope this one isn't another waste of my coin.
"So, the ending of my tale I began earlier..."
Is this your tale of single-handedly fighting off a pack of trolls or my favorite... where you bedded four women on the same night?
"Well, if you don't want to hear it, that's your loss."
"If I wanted to hear a tall tale, I'll read a children's storybook. Get some better stories, Vipir."
No! Don't leave me here! I beg you to let me out!
Please! I'll pay you. I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't leave me here!
Hurry! Get me out of here!
Use the key to open the door! We have to be quick!
Not now! It's time to get back at these crows.
I'm glad they didn't find my lucky dagger. It's time to gut these rotten birds. Lead the way!
"Now that we've got that out of the way, I'll take everything you have... or your life."
"Actually... on second thought, I'll just kill you!"
"Yours was not an easy transformation. But you're still alive, so congratulations."
We even have a celebration planned for you.
The bastards... somehow they managed to kill Skjor.
Hey! Over here! Get me out of here!
Hey you! Let me out! I can help!
Please! Help me get out of this cage. I don't know why those things locked me up and I don't want to wait around to find out.
One of those things has the key to this cage. If you get me out of here I'll help you slaughter the rest of those crows.
"Please, you can't leave me in here! If you let me out I can show you where they hide their best treasure."
"My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar."
"Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?"
"You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders."
Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back. I will ensure that men from Dawnstar get every opportunity for glory.
Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.
"I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod."
"Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here. I need every piece polished to a fine shine."
"Yes, my Jarl. We could hardly waste anyone else's precious time on such a tedious task."
"Exactly, Bulfrek. You always know your place."
"Skald, if you don't mind sir, I have a request."
"You, have a request of me, Bulfrek? This should be interesting."
"Well, I was thinking sir, with the war going on and all. Maybe, I could enlist? Fight the Imperials?"
"A servant? Enlisting in the Stormcloaks? Ah, Bulfrek, that's why I like having you about. You're always good for a laugh."
"Uh, yes sir. That's me. The oafish servant."
"Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us."
"I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed."
What good is a court mage if she refuses to fight? Where's your sense of duty?
"When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill."
"Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again."
"Skald, I've been meaning to ask you for a leave of absence. I wish to return to High Rock until this war is over."
"You wish to leave now? In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?"
"Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war."
"I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final."
"Just like old times, huh Horik? You and me fighting in a war over some forsaken scrap of land."
"Brings back memories. Do you have any orders for me, Legate?"
Keep the guard alert. I want to make sure no townspeople get hurt if there's trouble.
"Yes, Legate. No one is getting through us."
"Shor's bones, I hope you're right."
We should go over our strategy again in case the Stormcloaks attack.
"I don't think that's needed, Horik. It's the same strategy we used for every major defense during the Great War. It'll serve just as well now."
"Considering how the Great War ended, I think we need to be cautious about what we rely on."
Maybe you're right. I guess the battles I won yesterday won't win today's wars.
"I'm sorry, Legate. I didn't want to imply anything about your ability to lead. You're a hero to the Empire, and I...."
"Oh, don't be such an old stick, Horik. I was joking. I can do that, you know. Redo the battle plans. I'll look over them later."
"Yes, Legate."
"I want you to know I don't trust you, Madena. And I'll be watching you."
"I'll tell you the same thing I told Skald. I'm here to help the people of Dawnstar, not play politics. Point your suspicions of treachery elsewhere."
So you say. We'll see if that's true when the Stormcloaks make their move.
"Well, at the first sign of battle I'll be comfortably sitting in my room, waiting for it to end, so don't you worry."
"I've seen you walking with a bit of pain sometimes, Horik."
"I'm fine, Madena."
I know old men sometimes have pains in their legs when they rise from bed. I know a few spells that could help.
"I said I'm fine, Madena. I won't have some court mage fixing me up like some magical experiment."
"Still suspicious of me. Well, don't say I never offered."
"Madena, I was wondering if you could help me with something. Your magic would be invaluable."
"If this is about battle magic, forget it. I've told every Jarl I've served under that I won't...."
"Actually, I was just wondering if you could make sure people are tended to if they get hurt. I'm sure you wouldn't object to that."
"I, well, no of course not. I would be glad to help."
"Thank you, Madena. I appreciate your assistance."
"Father, do you want to talk? About mother?"
"No, Karita. I don't think I could."
"I'm sure she would want you to be happy, father. Entertaining the guests and drinking and making your lewd jokes like before."
I'm sorry. I just don't feel up to entertaining anyone just now.
"I was wondering, father. Maybe you should take a day off and head into town. I could watch the inn while you're away."
Why would I do that? There's work to be done here.
It'll do you good! Maybe you could visit Irgnir or Fruki on your way out? I've seen them looking at you when they come in for drinks....
Why would they be looking at me? Are they upset about the service?
"Oh, never mind."
This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.
I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....
"Well, it's a winding road up the mountain just ahead. You'll know you're in the right place once you spot the old watchtower."
"Once you get to the tower, head north. Bleak Falls Barrow should be just around the corner further up."
Is he? You've saved him?! I must see him at once!
"What? After all this, I can't even see him?"
"How... How do I know you're telling me the truth, and not just what I want to hear?"
[QUOTE]...for it bears aloft next summer's seeds.[QUOTE] That's my boy.
"So it's true, then. For now, it's enough to know that he's alive. I can find peace in that."
"Thank you, dear friend. You've given me back my son."
I'd had Eorlund forge this for Thorald. It was to be a present for his return. I suppose he can't have it now.
Why don't you take it? We can always make another for the day when this war ends and Thorald can come home.
"With Eorlund gone, I'm afraid I can't offer you much in the way of thanks. But please, take this. It's the least I can do."
"Sorry, lass... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time."
"Sorry, lad... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time."
"I'm busy right now, lass. We can talk later."
"I'm busy right now, lad. We can talk later."
"Always a pleasure, boss. What can I do for you?"
Pull up a seat and have a drink.
"Ah, you're back."
Something troublin' ya? I'll listen.
"So, what can I do for ya today?"
Still have quite a good bit of jobs available if you're looking for some extra coin.
Need some gold? I may have some work for you.
Looking for work?
Got lots of jobs available. Interested?
"So, you're the one Brynjolf's been jabberin' about. Been waitin' to have a word with you."
I think you better listen to Mercer and Brynjolf first. We can talk later.
Talk to me again if you prove yourself to Brynjolf.
Come back later and I may have some work for you.
I think Brynjolf can give you all the information you need.
Yeah?
I'm listenin'.
Looking to fix your armor?
Can I interest you in anything? Some fine armor perhaps?
Be glad to repair any damage to your Guild armor.
"So, name your poison! Ha ha ha. Oh, I never get tired of that one!"
Need some sort of toxin for a special occasion? That's where I come in.
I sell all sorts of poisons for almost every occasion.
Looking for the best smith in Skyrim? You found it.
They don't call me the Ember-Master for nothing. What do you need?
Need your weapon repaired? Or could I interest you in a new one?
I've got all sorts of weapons for the discerning marksman. What can I get you?
"If you're in the market for the finest bows money can buy, you're talking to the right person."
"Skilled, lethal and good-looking. Yep, it's a curse."
"Hey, let's talk a second."
"You're making waves around here. I like that. If you ever want to talk about anything, you let me know."
"Hey, how's it going. Need pickpocket training?"
"If you need pickpocket training, just let me know."
"If you want to be a master pickpocket like me, I can get you there."
"If you wondering why they call me Vipir the Fleet, watch me outrun the town guard sometime."
I've been a part of this Guild for as long as Mercer has been Guild Master.
"I might not be as big as some of my fellow Nords, but in a fight they can barely lay a hand on me."
"My specialty is pickpocketing. All I need is a rich mark, a moon-lit sky and I'm in my element."
I wouldn't mind teaching the ways of the pickpocket... if the gold was right.
I miss the glory days of this place. We had more coin stacked in the vaults than we even knew what to do with.
Come here a second.
A lot of people are beginning to get impressed with you here. Me included. Just wanted to let you know.
Interest you in some marksman training?
"If you need marksman training, and you've got the coin... I'm ready to teach you."
What's on your mind?
"Of course you can buy me a drink... you didn't need to say a word, but I heard you loud and clear."
Ugh. The wine in Skyrim tastes like urine compared to the fine vintages we had in Valenwood.
I don't miss home one bit. I'm glad to leave that life behind me.
I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father.
It's not hard to fit in and make friends when you have the coin to make it happen.
I don't bother with silly pickpocketing jobs when I can make far more at the gambling table.
Let's talk for moment.
"Look, if I was a little harsh before, I just wanted you to know it's because you were new. Know what I mean?"
"Well, hey there. What can Sapphire do for you?"
"Back from a job, huh? Hope it went well."
Want to talk? Go ahead.
They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.
"Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling."
"When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? Don't ask."
"Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history."
"I'm a deadeye marksman, lethal with a blade and dangerous in bed. And it only gets better from there."
"Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually."
Wanted to say something to you.
"I think you're all right. In fact, I'm kind of impressed how well you're doing around here. Just keep it between us, okay?"
"Yeah, you need something?"
What's going on?
"Sure, we can talk a minute."
"I've seen a lot of thieves come and go, but I've never seen anyone as good as me."
I could crack the lock on any house blindfolded before you even got your picks out of your pocket.
"Been in the Guild a long time... joined right after Brynjolf. Not interested in leadership though, that's more his kind of thing."
"I don't care if Vex was chosen as a Guild Third over me, she deserved it."
I kind of like watching things from where I am. Making money is all I care about.
"Hey, I want to talk to you... now."
"You're pretty tough, I respect that. Bringing in a lot of coin for the Guild, making us look good too. Let me know if you need anything, okay?"
Need something?
You want to talk to me? Okay.
"Yeah, I guess I have a minute. What do you want?"
"I'm the heavy hitter around here. When someone needs pushing around, I'm the one they send in."
"Used to run with a bandit clan in The Pale. Turns out I didn't like them and they didn't like me, so we parted ways."
"Brynjolf pulled me in a few years ago. Said the Guild was lacking some muscle, so I joined up."
"I've busted heads for Maven Black-Briar when she wants to keep her name out of it. Pays good, so why not?"
"I leave all that sneaking around nonsense to everyone else; believe me, when I'm coming for you... you'll know it."
Got a minute? Wanted to say something.
"I've never seen anyone with skills like yours. I just wanted to let you know that if you need anything, you can talk to me."
"Hey, good to see you!"
Something I can help with or do you just want to talk?
My brother in crime... what'd you need?
My sister in crime. What'd you need?
"Name's Rune. Yeah, rune... just like you're thinking."
"Have no idea what my birth name really is, and I frankly don't care."
"Being brought up by a poor family, I had to learn how to steal if I wanted to make ends meet."
Brynjolf actually caught me trying to pick his pocket in the market. If he was anyone else I would have gotten away with it.
I'm glad Brynjolf decided to let me join. Been trying to make some coin for him ever since.
"Hmph, so you're the one everyone's falling over."
"I don't know, you don't look so impressive to me. I mean, you're no Gray Fox, but you must be doing something right."
"I'm busy, is this important?"
Are you bothering me for a reason?
"Oh, this should be good."
We haven't met.
"Name's Garthar. Remember it, because you're going to hear a lot about me."
"Still learning the ropes, but I'll get the hang of it."
Been doing a few jobs for Vex... how about you?
Did you want something?
Our Guild Master graces me with a visit. What can I do for you?
Steal anything worth talking about?
Back with good news I trust.
Well? You done or what?
Out with it. Time is money.
"So, feeling loose? How about you run a job for me."
Need a few spare septims? I got the cure right here.
I have work if you've got the backbone.
Ready for some work or you just going to wander around all day?
"So, you're the new recruit everyone's been talking about, eh? I guess it's about time we talked."
"After you talk to Brynjolf and Mercer, come back and see me."
I have no business with you.
I'm busy. Don't you have something to do?
I'm not here to hold your hand. Figure this one out for yourself.
You need advice? Talk to Brynjolf... I got better things to do.
I have no business with you.
"Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying."
Don't you have better things to do than disturb me?
"This better be important, I'm quite busy."
"You never talk much about yourself, do you Horik? I swear, these past 30 years you've been at my side, and I think I barely know you."
"What's to say? I was born on a farm, joined the Legion when I came of age, and I've served you ever since."
What about your family? There must have been someone waiting for you back at the farm. Wondering if you were ever coming home?
No. Can't say there was. My parents died when I was young. You and the Legion have been my only family since.
"I see. You're a good soldier, Horik. I'm sorry for intruding."
You weren't. There's just not much to it.
Are you all right? You seem tired.
"I'm fine, Horik. I just... are you worried about this war?"
"No. If we must fight, we will, and you will lead us to victory. As you always have."
"With you by my side, is that right Horik?"
Of course. I would have it no other way.
"So much for old soldiers settling down to a life of luxury, eh?"
The forge is hot today.
"Not hot enough. Does your Skyrim ever get warm, husband?"
"Rustleif, I've been wondering. Maybe after the baby is born, we should move to Hammerfell."
"Hammerfell? I'm not against the idea, but why?"
I'm just worried about raising a child in the middle of this war of yours.
"War of mine? It's not my war, Seren!"
"Your people's war, I mean. The Nords. What kind of life would we be giving our little one if we stayed here?"
"I... well, let me think about it."
Keep at it. We need to work twice as hard now that fat-headed Leigelf has declared war!
We're at war with Leigelf? Isn't he your husband?
"No he isn't! He's the enemy, and we are going to crush him."
"Drafted into a war, how could my life get worse?"
"Work hard, now! The pride of Iron-Breaker Mine is on the line."
"Pride of the what? This isn't the Legion, boss. We're miners, not soldiers."
"You'll shut your mouth and get back to work, or you won't be a miner or a soldier by the day's end. Hear me?"
"Uh, yes ma'am."
Thank you for sticking by me.
Where else would I go? Dawnstar is my home and working here is my job.
It's good to hear you say that. I wish my wife was as simple as you.
"I'll, uh, just take that as a compliment."
"If you don't mind me saying, Leigelf. You're working too hard. Go home."
"Never. Not until we turn this mine around, drive Beitild out of business, and force her to apologize to me for everything she's done!"
What is this feud you have with your wife? What started this?
I don't want to talk about it.
"You don't want to talk about it, or you don't know?"
I don't want to talk about it.
"We are poised for glory, Jod. The Empire will never take Dawnstar while every last man, woman, and child here draws breathe!"
"With respect, Jarl. You can't ask everyone to throw themselves against trained Legionnaires. Let's leave the fighting to the Stormcloaks."
You're right. Why dilute the glory with too many souls fighting over it? We'll drive out the Empire and be celebrated as heroes when we win.
If we win. This war is going to drag on for years. I can feel it. We need to prepare for a long struggle ahead.
Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time.
The path to Paarthurnax lies through this gate. I will show you how to open the way.
You made it!
We need to get inside. Follow me!
Come on! We need to get inside before that dragon comes back!
"If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place."
"A few drinks, a few laughs and a contest. What could be better?"
Maybe you just aren't up to the challenge...
"No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it."
"Now... if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?"
"If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods involve secrecy and discretion."
"Now... if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?"
That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood... the telltale sign of a practiced thief.
I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.
Don't give them a chance to warn the others!
Be careful men. There's bound to be more up ahead.
What in the nine holds is that?
Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.
Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old bonewalkers.
We're not leaving here until we get what we came for.
The Blades are wise not to trust me. Onikaan ni ov. I would not trust another dovah.
"Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power is in our blood. You feel it in yourself, do you not?"
I can be trusted. I know this. But they do not. Onikaan ni ov dovah. It is always wise to mistrust a dovah.
I have overcome my nature only through meditation and long study of the Way of the Voice.
No day goes by where I am not tempted to return to my inborn nature. Zin krif horvut se suleyk.
"What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"
(Deep breath)
(Deep breath)
(Deep breath)
(Deep exhale)
(Deep exhale)
(Deep exhale)
That's the spirit. Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated.
Amusing.
"She was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair."
She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful.
All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her.
Mother thought I should be taught a lesson for airing the family's dirty laundry in public.
"I mean, I've... taken care of many people for her in the past. What in Oblivion did she expect me to do?"
"Ah well. At least I have all the comforts of home during my stay. Well, except the touch of a woman of course."
I've been hurt worse before.
"Please, I beg you, don't tell Sibbi where I am. He'll kill me!"
"Sibbi's been spreading lies about me, you must hear me out."
"Well, that's just about the best news I've heard all week."
"I was going to give this to whomever killed her for me, but I suppose you've earned it by bringing me this information."
This key opens one of my drop spots in the basement of the meadery. Take anything inside you like.
"Cut out the middleman, eh? Shrewd, very shrewd. You sure you don't have some Black-Briar blood in you?"
You idiot. You came all the way down here for that?
"You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information."
This key opens one of my stashes in the basement of the meadery. Help yourself to any of its contents.
"I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls."
Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes.
My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable.
"To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot."
Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?
That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated.
It's exhilarating to observe the effects of my potions on the body. Watching the heart stop... the eyes go blind.
We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of different functions all working in tandem to keep us alive.
"Yet if only a single part of our imperfect machine fails, life fails. It makes one realize how fragile... how flawed we are."
You ask why I'm so fascinated? The irony... the irony that the same world that gave us life provides us the means to die.
Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.
Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower.
Last we have deathbell which only grows in marshy tundra terrain. Its inverted bluish-purple flower bunches are unmistakable.
Disappointing.
"Yes, Master Elgrim will be pleased I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients."
"I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs."
Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so.
Where did you learn of that? Who have you been talking to?
Where did you learn of a Shout used to defeat Alduin?
"Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand. Or who you stand with."
"Ah, the prophecy. Be wary of prophecy. Some are meant as a guide. Some as a warning. Are you sure you can tell one from the other?"
"Halt! You have no business here, outsider. Leave at once."
"Ugor, no! This may be the one we need."
We need nothing from outsiders! Yamarz will provide for us.
We cannot carry on this way! You know we are doomed if we do not do something!
Yamarz charged me with keeping outsiders away from Largashbur. You would have me disobey him?
"You were charged with keeping us inside the walls. Have faith, Ugor. I only wish the best for our tribe."
"Fine, it's your neck."
Forgive Ugor's harsh words. She is merely doing as she has been told.
You have returned. Will you now aid me in contacting Malacath?
"Our chief is weakened. He will not rest, will not sleep. He suffers, and so the tribe suffers."
"Yamarz is proud, and refuses to see that we need outside help."
"He needs someone to confide in. If it will not be one of us, perhaps it will be you. Go to him."
Atub! Meddlesome woman... You would help us? Help me?
"Tell me, outsider. Can you banish spirits? For that is what I need."
"Spirits! Ghosts! I am cursed, haunted, and I can do nothing. Can you fix that?"
"Of course you cannot. No one can. It is my lot as Chief of this tribe, and so I suffer quietly."
"The kind that curse you, haunt you in the dead of night. There is nothing you can do, nothing anyone can do."
"Shagrol, once the leader of this tribe, unhappy with his demise, has dealt with Malacath himself to curse me, curse us all."
You? An outsider? I'd sooner slit my own throat than accept help from you.
To even consider it would be such a sign of weakness that I might as well abandon my tribe now.
"So, he says to petition Malacath for relief? Interesting."
"Perhaps. But he spoke of this [QUOTE]curse[QUOTE] to you, which means it has deeply affected him."
It may be worth attempting contact with Malacath after all.
"Go to Malacath's shrine, southeast of Largashbur. See if perhaps he will aid us after all."
"Yes, but he offered it as an idea. Perhaps he hopes it will be helpful, but does not wish to risk personal failure."
"You should do as he says. Go to Malacath's shrine, northwest of here, and ask for his help. See what happens."
"His shrine lies northwest of Largashbur. I am unsure that he will listen, but it cannot hurt."
The ears of the wind?
Malacath himself said this to you? But what does it... Ah! Yes! I see! A ritual is necessary!
"This message is for me. I understand now. I have work to do. You, I shall need your help."
"I need a Daedra's heart, at once! Quickly, quickly!"
"What?! No, that's not me. I'm not Esbern. I don't know what you're talking about."
Go away!
I told you to go away. I'm not opening this door for anybody!
"Delphine? How do you... so you've finally found her, and she led you to me. And here I am, caught like a rat in a trap."
"Oh, how reassuring! Most likely you're with the Thalmor and this is just a trick to get me to open the door!"
I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries.
Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal.
But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to make the forgeries.
By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing... it worked.
Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your superior.
Is there... something else you need?
"Yes, um.... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually."
"I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries."
"Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own."
"I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries."
"Right, then. You prefer to listen, is that it? Well, you must represent the Dark Brotherhood. I certainly wasn't expecting anyone else."
So I'll cut right to the chase.
"I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries."
"As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied."
I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable.
But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target.
The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of...
...the Emperor.
"Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that."
"So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's as if the very stars have finally aligned."
"But I digress. Here, take these to your, um... superior."
Rexus. The items.
"That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No?"
"You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned."
"But I digress. Here, take these. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior."
Rexus. The items.
"It's a shocking request, I know. But it is inside the purview of what you Dark Brotherhood types do. Isn't it? If history is to be believed?"
"You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now you're here, as if the very stars have finally aligned."
"But I digress. Here, let me give you these. They are to be delivered to your, um... superior."
Rexus. The items.
"You think I don't know that? If anyone learned of this meeting, my corpse would swing over Solitude for a decade!"
But what I ask of you... it must be done. There is too much at stake.
"I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I thought you guaranteed discretion."
Is this no longer so?
"In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood assassin."
"His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in Imperial policy."
"There are those now who wish for a similar change. I am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say."
"Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there will be gold... a fortune in gold. But so much more!"
"It is said that the Dark Brotherhood, in recent years, has been in decline. That you lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so?"
"If you do this, if you kill the Emperor... Oh, how the masses will fear and respect you."
"The logistics of such an endeavor will be staggering, I know. There will be several minor assassinations necessary. Leading up to the... main target."
"As I mentioned, the amulet I gave you is exceptionally valuable, and will certainly cover the costs of all these other unpleasantries."
"The sealed letter explains everything else, in detail. It should be delivered to your superior. Whomever that may be."
"You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What did he want?"
You're joking.
What's this?
"By Sithis, you're not joking."
To kill the Emperor of Tamriel... The Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius.
"As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was two hundred years ago..."
"No, she certainly wouldn't. And... for whatever reason, she chose to relay Motierre's information to you."
"I don't know exactly what's going on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some fluke, or what. But what we now have before us..."
"You're damn right we'll accept it. If we pull this off, the Dark Brotherhood will know a fear and respect we haven't seen in centuries."
You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory?
"But this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm..."
"I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with selling it."
"And, there's only one man who can give us what we need - Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften."
"Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit - that's fine."
Delvin Mallory and the Dark Brotherhood have... history. He can be trusted.
Dangerous-looking elves who didn't give their names. Draw your own conclusions.
Various shady types I've never seen before. I'd watch my back if I was you.
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place - has someone bring him food and such.
"Crazy old coot, from what I've heard. For that to stand out down here, he must really be off his nut."
He lives somewhere in the Ratway Warrens. Must be crazy or desperate to live down there. Maybe both.
Haven't you figured it out yet? What more needs to happen before you all wake up and see what's going on?
"Alduin has returned, just like the prophecy said!"
"The Dragon from the dawn of time, who devours the souls of the dead!"
"No one can escape his hunger, here or in the afterlife! Alduin will devour all things and the world will end. Nothing can stop him!"
"The Blades knew, once upon a time. Alduin's Wall is the key. Yes, yes!"
"Don't move. Don't move. I have it here, somewhere... never thought it would be any use, but now..."
And now you pay for meddling in the Thalmor's affairs.
That's him! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill him!
That's her! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill her!
"Yes! Yes! You see, you know but you refuse to understand!"
Did you learn anything useful?
Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man...
"Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons."
"Let's go, let's go! Before anyone notices us."
"Hmm. I guess that will have to do. You should pass for a real guest, at least until you open your mouth."
Ready to board the carriage to the embassy?
"You made it out alive, at least. Your gear's safe in my room, as promised."
I've figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.
Really? That seems hard to believe. You're sure about that?
"You're right, you're right. I just... I was sure it must have been them. If not the Thalmor, who? Or... what?"
"You mean, aside from wanting to kill every Blade they can lay their hands on?"
"Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the Thalmor smashed us during the Great War."
He knew everything about the ancient dragonlore of the Blades.
"Obsessed with it, really. Nobody paid much attention back then. I guess he wasn't as crazy as we all thought."
"Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a plot by the other side..."
"Even so, we've got to find Esbern before they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does."
Do they know where he is?
"Riften, eh? Probably down in the Ratway, then. It's where I'd go."
"You'd better get to Riften. Ask around the Ragged Flagon, in the Ratway. It's at least a good starting point."
You'd better get to Riften. Talk to Brynjolf. He's... well-connected. A good starting point at least.
Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm stuck down here.
Is anyone out there? Anyone?
"You, you there! Help me, I'm trapped."
"Are we alone? Yes... yes... alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan."
"The others... I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex... perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child..."
"What about you? Have you... have you spoken to anyone? No.... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and saying!"
"And what do you do? Nothing! Not... not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys!"
"You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you..."
...sweet Night Mother.
"Finally, you're back."
Looking for the blade? You aren't the first!
"You won't take my eye, man-thing!"
"You're after that damn hilt? Go ahead, try and take it!"
Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens. Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.
"Lot of people looking for him. Don't know his name, but he's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here."
"Well... there is guy like that. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you."
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Be careful. You're not the only one looking for him.
Huh. Lot of old guys around. I don't really know how I can help.
"Don't know his name, but there is a guy like that hiding out down here. Paid plenty for nobody to know about it."
"You're not the first person to come in here asking about him, either, so be careful."
"Yeah, I think I know who you mean. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you."
"Down in the Ratway Warrens. Nice place, if you don't mind the stench, rats, and assorted lowlifes as neighbors."
"That's interesting. Why do I care? You want a drink, or maybe just a few broken bones?"
"Never heard of anybody like that. But if you want to hide out in Riften, the Ratway's where you'd be."
"There's a sort of tavern down there, the Ragged Flagon. Where all the lowlifes in Riften get drunk and knife each other."
"You might try there, if you can get through the Ratway alive."
My husband Leigelf is dead. I... I never thought I would miss that oaf so much.
Iron-Breaker Mine is three times the worth of that Quicksilver Mine and its fat-head owner.
My miners are as dumb as rocks are grey.
"The Mortar and Pestle has cures for every illness, from Ataxia to Witbane."
A Stamina Potion maybe? Popular with young men.
Frost took my husband years ago. He was a good man.
My children all grew up and left Dawnstar to make their fortune.
I will serve Dawnstar as I always have.
"You should see the grin on Horik's face now that we're in charge. I know he hides it, but I can tell."
The Jarl and I have our disagreements. Sorry if you had to overhear one of them.
"I wasn't born in Skyrim, but when I served in the Legion this land became my home."
Horik and I have lived here ever since I retired. He's a good soldier.
My duty is to guard Brina Merilis.
Watch your hands around the Legate.
I've been in the Legion all my life. I'm content to serve.
I'm just one of the miners. I don't want any trouble.
"You should speak to the Jarl if you need something, stranger."
"I'm no one special, just a miner who swings a pickaxe for his drinking money."
"Beitild thinks I drink on the job. Well, what does it matter if I do? Huh?"
My wife Beitild is dead. Can't say I miss that old sabre cat.
"Quicksilver Mine is the best mine in Dawnstar, and you can tell those Iron-Breaker miners I said so."
"If it's about the mine, I'm all ears."
Need a dagger? No? How about a claymore?
"You looking for a shield? Best thing between you and the enemy, friend."
Don't forget getting a good pair of gauntlets. Broken hands can't hold a sword.
I hear people were spotted using the Black Door. Gods have mercy.
"I work steel, weapons mostly."
Most of the guards in Dawnstar carry swords forged from his very smithy.
I trained in Hammerfell during my journeyman years. Redguard smiths are second to none.
"I'll forge you a weapon tomorrow. Right now, I'm closed."
I traveled far and wide when I was younger. Glad to have settled down finally.
I help my husband Rustleif run the forge. He's a marvel with steel.
"I married Rustleif when he was in Hammerfell, apprenticing under my father."
The only thing I dislike about my husband's homeland is the cold. Why is it always so cold?
We discovered recently that I am with child. I'll need to stop working next season.
"I work in the mine, just like everyone else."
Used to be twice as many miners working here before all this trouble started.
I mine. Work the smelter. Ain't much else to tell.
Been mining all my life. Quicksilver is as much my home as anywhere.
Damn Imperials. They won't hold Dawnstar forever.
"Why are you speaking to me, Imperial?"
"The nightmares in Dawnstar have lifted, and I hear you helped that happen. You have my thanks."
I've been in charge of Dawnstar for over 35 years.
No Empire is going to take the Jarlship away from this Son of Skyrim.
The Pale will throw those Imperial backbiters up against the wall when they come for us.
Skyrim will not bow to a false king any longer. Ulfric is the true king.
"Jarl Skald is upset over the loss of Dawnstar. I'll admit, it's less I have to worry about."
You should leave. Skald gets upset around Imperials.
I'm Skald's housecarl and head of his guard in Dawnstar.
My only aim is to keep the peace.
Skald is very... vocal about his hatred of the Empire.
The tenacity of the Imperial Legion is legendary. We need to be ready for them.
I served in the Great War against the Thalmor. I remember how bravely a Legionnaire can fight.
"Jarl gets booted from Dawnstar, and I'm still stuck cleaning up the dirt."
"What do you want, Imperial? Ain't my life hard enough?"
Just a servant of Skald the Elder. Not worthy of time or consideration.
There's no honor in being a Jarl's servant. No Sovngarde waits for dust cleaners.
My family has served Skald Felgeif's family for generations.
"Oh, it's just wonderful being Skald's servant. He's not demanding in the least."
I'm here to lend my magic to the people of Dawnstar.
"I had hoped life would be simpler here, but war seems to find a way of following me."
I served in the Great War as a Legion battlemage. I've no desire to go back.
I'll work my spells and potions for whoever is willing to leave Dawnstar in peace.
The Windpeak Inn features the finest bard in all of Dawnstar. Me.
Let me know if you need a drink. That's what we're here for.
Sorry if my father seems a bit distracted. A lot's happened.
I'm sorry. My mind was just somewhere else. Did you need a room? Drink?
"Oh, do you need a room?"
My daughter Karita sings to the guests when she can. She has her mother's voice.
"Everyone thinks I'm too young to be a ship's captain, but I'm going to prove them wrong."
I don't buy all that talk about ship captains having to be stern and strict. I want my crewmen to enjoy their work.
"I inherited the ship when my mother passed away. She spent her life on the water, and now I do, too."
"I'm good with stars and charts, but I admit I've got some things to learn about leading men."
I plan to spend all the days I got left on the water. It's where I belong.
"Once sailing gets in your blood, it don't get out."
"I been a sailor for so long, I could navigate these rivers an' seas blindfolded."
"Cap'n Wayfinder's as green as seaweed, but he's learnin'."
"I don't like taking orders from a boy, but I need the gold."
I could run this ship better than that boy who calls himself a captain. Maybe one day I'll do something about it.
The captain inherited the Sea Squall from his mother when she died. Maybe I can inherit the ship if he dies...
Not a day goes by that I don't think about finding a new ship. I guess it's easier just to stay put.
You should talk to Rustleif. Get some proper steel.
"Old lady Frida is a grouch, but she sure can whip up a cure for the Rattles fast."
"Beware of Frostmere Crypt, friend. Heard some bandits are living in the ruins now."
Giants have been spotted up near Red Road Pass. Best to keep away and avoid it entirely.
Dawnstar is the last port of call before Solitude. Damn rebels aren't taking it.
"We won't give up this port to the Imperials without a fight, don't you worry."
"Dangerous post, Dawnstar. If the bandits don't get you, the animals will."
Here to dig. That's all.
"Dawnstar's got its problems, but as long as the ore is good, I'll stay."
Here to mine?
Quicksilver ore is rare. Worth digging.
Been working in Iron-Breaker since I was a boy.
"Iron's a good, stout metal. A fine thing for a Nord to dig."
Plenty of iron to dig.
Mining's an honest trade. No real tricks to it.
I work for the Windpeak Inn. You should head on inside.
Thoring runs the inn. Speak to him.
Don't make a mess of this.
Let's just get this over with.
"Curses aren't enough, now must I suffer you too? What is it?"
"Why are you here, outsider?"
"Please, help Yamarz. Do whatever you can. Our tribe depends on you."
I must focus now. This ritual is very important.
I will stay right here and wait for you to bring me what I need.
Do you bring word from Malacath?
Do whatever Yamarz asks of you. It cannot make things worse.
Speak to Yamarz. Convince him to let you help him.
"You should not be here, outsider."
"We have angered Malacath, and so we must be punished."
Our tribe has survived this long without you interfering. We'll be fine.
We have sworn loyalty to Yamarz. He will see us through these dark times.
"By the Ashpit, we can't go on like this."
You must help us appease Malacath.
Please hurry. We are counting on you.
"It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well, erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad."
"But it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones."
Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery.
"That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door, and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him inside."
Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed. But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary?
The very thought breaks my heart.
"Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary."
"Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even."
"Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess."
I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn.
And make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his... ally arrive! They could be planning another meeting at any time!
"If I have to hold your hand through everything, maybe you aren't cut out for this kind of work."
"It's under your feet, lad. Just follow the smell."
"If I have to hold your hand through everything, maybe you aren't cut out for this kind of work."
"It's under your feet, lass. Just follow the smell."
"The walls have ears and you're being tested, lad. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon."
"The walls have ears and you're being tested, lass. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon."
I'm one of the last members of the Blades.
"A very long time ago, the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer."
"For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose."
"Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them."
Go ahead. Whatever you want to know. Nothing held back.
Not a damn thing. I was just as surprised as you to find that big black dragon here.
Really? Where?
Interesting. Same dragon...
"Damn it, we're blundering around in the dark here! We need to figure out who's behind it all!"
The first thing we need to do is figure out who's behind the dragons.
"The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved, they'll know who is."
Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else.
"The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on."
"And now the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is weakened, the Empire is weakened."
Who else gains from that but the Thalmor?
"I'm not sure yet. I have a few ideas, but I'll need some time to pull things together..."
"Meet me back in Riverwood. If I'm not back when you get there, wait for me. I shouldn't be long."
Keep an eye on the sky. This is only going to get worse.
I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.
We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.
I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.
We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.
I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise.
"But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?"
Welcome to our home.
"Mother, what's the meaning of this? Who have you brought into our home?"
"Avulstein, put that down! He's here to help us find Thorald!"
"Avulstein, put that down! She's here to help us find Thorald!"
How do we know he's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
How do we know she's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
We can't trust anyone! Who knows what they'll do if they find me here.
"I can't take any more of this. No weapons, please. Let's just talk."
"All right, mother."
"So, you're here to help?"
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Are you working with the Battle-Borns? Speak now before I put you in the ground!
"I know that Thorald's not dead. I just know it. The Imperials have him, and are keeping him somewhere. But I don't know where."
Those damned Battle-Borns... they know something. They're hiding it. They practically taunt us with it. They must have some sort of proof!
There's got to be something in that house of theirs. I just know it.
I don't dare leave the house myself. So I need your help.
"My brother, Thorald. He was fighting for the Stormcloaks, and went missing. Everyone assumes he's dead."
"But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where."
"I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him."
So I need someone to find that proof for me.
"Anything, anything at all would be a start. Then we can figure out how to get to him."
"I'm sorry for doubting you, friend. You have my thanks."
"Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away!"
"I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it."
"Anything that confirms that Thorald isn't dead, but is being held captive. I know those Battle-Borns have it."
"They'd be hiding it, of course. Wouldn't want it to get out that they've been lying this whole time."
But you might be able to butter them up enough to lower their guard.
"I knew it! Let me see, please!"
"The Thalmor? By the Nine, it's worse than I thought."
So... Northwatch Keep. Then we know where to hit them.
"Well, where is it? Forgive me, but I don't dare just trust your word, no matter who you are."
"I knew he wasn't gone, I just knew it!"
"Please, get that to Avulstein right away."
Are you sure? I doubt you stand a chance against the Thalmor.
I can have a group of men ready at a moment's notice. Many would be willing to help rescue my brother.
"Very well. I'll give you a chance. But if you can't do it, I will."
Exactly. Together we stand more of a chance of making this work.
"Make your way to Northwatch Keep in Haafingar. I'll meet you near there, and we'll plan our assault."
"What? You, alone, reasoning with the Thalmor? That's madness, friend."
"You're serious, aren't you?"
"We kill every Thalmor between us and Thorald, and we bring him out alive. Let's go."
Let me do the talking.
Not now.
"Shut up, will you?"
What can I get for you?
"You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open this door and we can get you on your way."
Let's hope we both live through this day.
"And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!"
"So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!"
"For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both heavens and earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!"
"Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!"
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this.
"Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. We need to show Tullius we won't be pushed around."
"Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius needs to know I won't be pushed around."
"Maybe so, but we shouldn't be making concessions before negotiations even start. Makes us look weak."
"Maybe so, but I can't be making concessions before negotiations even start. It makes the Empire look weak."
I'm glad we agree on this.
Well said.
Well said.
"Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on this."
"Hmm. I guess I'll defer to your judgment on this one, but I think it's a mistake."
We're off to a good start.
Well said.
"The great stronghold of Narzulbur welcomes you, outsider."
Come to purchase ebony? Our Gloombound Mine runs thick with black veins.
"The blessings of the mine have been many, but I have no mate to share them."
I am proud to have a mate to share in my blessings.
"Been married many times, but the gods keep taking them from me."
I'm hoping this wife can outlast the winter.
"I've read the entrails many times, but can't fathom why Mauhulakh's wives keep finding tragedy."
"All my auguring never predicted this. A woman for Mauhulakh, eh? We'll see how this goes."
"Urog and Dushnamub were such lovely children. I held them as they watched their mothers die after birth. They know me best, now."
Mauhulakh was such a darling boy. Until he got older and started having opinions.
Yatul and I tend to dote on Mauhulakh. You know how aunts can be with their favorite nephew.
Mauhulakh. He wants to be a leader but spends too much time moping over women. Bolar and I should be all he needs.
"Well at least now Mauhulakh has nothing to whine about. Until this one dies, too."
Orc chiefs should be strong and stand alone. They need no companions. Progeny is a poor excuse.
I know I sound abrasive. It's just that I love Mauhulakh so much that I want us to be happy together.
My brother keeps trying to spin these fantasies to me about my aunts and our father. He's crazy.
Uglarz is a great huntress. Perhaps she can teach me something new.
"I never would have thought, but Uglarz is an even better hunter than Yatul was. The things I'm learning now..."
"Yatul's been teaching me to hunt. I'm still learning, but she's the best teacher I could have."
Sometimes I wonder if my aunts are right about my father -- he does seem weak.
"New to Narzulbur? If you're smart, you'll keep moving. There is a wicked shadow over this place."
Haven't you seen how my aunts act with my father? It's beyond strange.
Glad my father seems to have found someone. I just hope she can hold her own against my aunts.
"I never knew my mother, but I doubt even she acted as affectionate with my father as Yatul and Bolar do."
I think I like this new mate of my father's. I mean... nothing like that. I just think she's nice.
"My sister is blind. I've told her she shouldn't spend so much time with Yatul, but she won't listen. Thinks she's nice."
Gadba and me came to work the mine. The plan is to get rich and then go back to Largashbur and take over!
"Mauhulakh brought us in when he found ebony in the mine. Not enough men in town to work it, so here we are."
One of these days we need to head back to the Rift. Get some of that good Riften mead.
Mul is the smart one. I go where he tells me.
"Mining is tough, but Mul says the money is good so we mine."
"When we go back to Largashbur we'll be kings. I like Narzulbur, but don't tell Mul."
I used to have five good men who worked the mill with me. Then this war started and they all ran off. Idiots with mead in their blood.
"There's plenty of good wood around here, but I just can't harvest it all by myself. Everyone able-bodied is fighting."
"Of course, without functioning mills, who will make the arrows for our soldiers? Men have no sense of irony."
"Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?"
Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.
"The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow."
"Bolfrida is certainly grating, but she pays well. Thankfully nobody from the city can see me out here."
"Farm work is hard work. It's good to relax when I can, but I still have to listen to my brothers harping about [QUOTE]injustices.[QUOTE]"
Of course working for Bolfrida isn't my first choice. But what else can a Dunmer do out here?
"My sister and I both work for the Nords. Our brother is ashamed of us, but at least we can affort to eat."
"Starting to get too old to work all day, but hopefully Master Hlaalu will let me slow down a bit."
Every now and then someone from the city comes by. Think they aren't used to seeing a Nord working for a Dark Elf.
"Better to work in the cold than in the heat, I say. Though some sun would be nice."
"Master Cruel-Sea comes and works the fields sometimes. I don't think the Mistress likes it, but she won't come out here to catch him."
"Once the sun goes down, it's just me and the dogs. They keep me warm, and don't talk too much."
I wonder if I could put the dogs to work somehow. But I don't really have the heart to force them.
"Calm yourself, Galmar. Save it for the battlefield."
Our men are getting massacred out there. Damn Imperials.
We can't march on Solitude. Not yet. One thing at a time.
We need to move faster. Keep them off balance.
"It's working, Galmar. Our patience has won us friends and allies. And our armies are systematically taking care of the rest."
Is there any news from High Rock?
Not a peep. Those prissy Bretons can't be made to lift a finger to help their neighbors.
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. They've never had many problems with the Empire.
Those milk drinkers? Might as well be elves. Think they're better than us.
Regardless. It appears Skyrim must stand alone. Again.
I'm still not sure I understand what you're asking.
"A navy, my lord. We could stop the influx of Imperial troops to Solitude, and choke their northern lines."
"But most of their supply routes come south, from Cyrodiil."
"But imagine -- fleets of ships sailing from Windhelm, all bearing the Stormcloak flag! It would be glorious!"
And I suppose the Cruel-Seas would be just the clan to provide ships and men?
You need but ask.
"I'll think on this, but I make no promises."
"I can ask no more. Thank you, my lord!"
"Captain, I've been receiving complaints about this Giordano woman."
"Yes, sir. I've been trying to quiet her, but she's insistent. She thinks she can find out who's been killing the women..."
I don't care if she can find a living dwarf -- I can't have her stirring up trouble. We have enough problems as it is.
"Yes, sir. I'll try to contain her."
See that you do. I will not let Windhelm descend into chaos over a few overactive imaginations.
What's the current spirit among the dark elves?
"As restless as ever, sir, but I don't see them taking any kind of incendiary action. Not soon, anyway."
"Well that much is good. Let's finish this first war before starting the next one, eh?"
"Um... yes, of course, sir."
"Carry on, Lonely-Gale. And loosen yourself a bit."
Galmar thinks we should double our men in the Reach.
A reasonable strategy.
"And you, Jorleif?"
"Well, sir, the hold of Falkreath is fairly vulnerable, and blocks the only road from Cyrodiil."
"A good point, old friend."
"To be sure, my lord, I am not skilled in the arts of war or military tactics."
"But you're able to see the whole in the parts, and for that I'm grateful."
"As you wish, sir."
"Sir, there continues to be unrest in the Gray Quarter."
Blasted dark elves. I don't suppose you could tell them that I presently have larger concerns? Such as all of Skyrim?
"They don't seem to be very sympathetic to our cause, sir."
Let me know if you hear anything more substantial?
"Of course, my lord."
"Jorleif, I want you to send a messenger to our western camps."
"And the message, sir?"
I'm diverting Gar and Haddring's men to join him.
"Is that wise, sir?"
It will work if we can pull Hran's men from the south. And find a bit of luck.
Of course. Something that seems to be in short supply these days.
"I'm not seeking advice right now, friend. Just send the message."
"So what's the news on the street, Captain?"
The dark elves are uneasy. There's a killer on the streets. And Viola Giordano won't leave me alone.
How would you like a drink?
Very much so.
Coming right up.
"Calixto, someone left an interesting ring in here a few weeks ago. Would you like a look?"
"Of course, my dear. It may prove to be quite the curiosity! One must always be alert."
"Well, I seem to have misplaced it at the moment. But it was white, like alabaster, with three bright rubies set in it."
Be very careful with that. It sounds as if it may be the Death Ring of Dro'farahn. A ring of the most dangerous sort.
Oh dear. What should I do?
Bring it to me straight away when you find it. Don't dally. I can keep it safe.
"Oh, thank the gods you're in Windhelm, Calixto!"
Think nothing of it.
"Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me."
Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything all right?"
"It's been better, I'll be honest with you."
"Here, let me get you some mead. This one's on me."
"I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it."
"I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks."
What about being loyal to his wife?
"I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute."
"Don't you ever find it demeaning, working for that Nord family?"
"Look, Ambarys, I just came here for a drink. I don't need any trouble."
"Fine, then. I guess some Dunmer are content to be their pets."
"Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and you're going to leave me alone. Deal?"
"What's new with the Cruel-Seas, Suvaris? Have they given you one of those helmets with the horns on them yet?"
"What do you want from me? I work for them ok? We're not friends. They pay me, and I get the job done. That's it."
Touchy. Maybe some Dunmer lives in you yet.
"Either pour another drink or keep moving, Ambarys."
"Why do the Nords bother you so much, Ambarys?"
Why do you even need to ask? They treat your people as bad as they do mine.
"I think that's just their way. The Nords don't like anybody who's not a Nord, but they're not bad people, deep down."
Look around you. Don't you know what their little war is about? They want all non-Nords out of Skyrim. That means you and me.
"Oh, I doubt that very much. Who would load their ships, then?"
Just you wait and see.
How much do they pay you per day?
That's really none of your business...
How much?
"Eight septims per day, plus lodging."
"Eight septims for breaking your back, and then you live in squalor. How much is your dignity worth?"
"If it's all the same to you, Scouts-Many-Marshes prefers to eat and drink in peace."
"Sorry, my scaly friend, you've come to the wrong place. Around here we don't ignore what's happening in the world."
"Niranye, I just have to know -- what is your secret?"
"My... my what, now?"
You know. Where do you get your goods? I am always amazed at how you manage to sell things so cheaply.
"Oh, just a matter of finding the right suppliers."
"Well, I'll want to meet them next time they're around. Maybe you can give an introduction."
I'll consider it. Many of the people I deal with are... secretive. You know how it is.
"Of course! I undersand completely. You just put us in a room, and I'll do all the talking. No worries at all."
Thanks for getting me out of that. Bashnag's coven chased me out and left me for dead down here. Nobody lasts too long with the spiders.
"Please, will you help me get out of here? If the coast is clear, I'll make a break for it."
"I'm too weak right now. Between the spiders and the coven, I'd be dead before escaping the cave."
"I'm feeling better, but Bashnag's curse won't wear off for weeks."
I won't be myself for some time. I just need to get out of here and recover.
Bashnag cursed me. I can't cast a spell to save my life right now. I'll have to wait until the way out is safe.
"Please, let me know if it seems safe to leave."
"I am, and I don't want to hear your moral judgments about it, either. I wouldn't have had to study in secret in the old days."
I left for a few days in Riften. When I came back Bashnag accused me of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. I was cursed and chased off.
My daughter was sent to the orphanage there when I stood accused of illegal necromancy. I had no choice. Run or die.
"I joined with Bashnag then, but I thought of Savela every day. So I snuck off, hoping to find and steal away with her."
"Only, she was gone. Shipped away to another orphanage, or adopted, or... I didn't know what else to do, so I came back, hoping nobody noticed I left."
He is? I'm not sure how to feel about that.  Perhaps it's for the better.
Bashnag's circle of mages. We - well [QUOTE]they[QUOTE] live here. They made it pretty clear that I'm no longer welcome.
These are no dainty college mages. Bashnag has the skill of a magister and the mind of a warlord. This is a dangerous bunch.
"They're good company if you want to study necromancy in peace, though."
"Thank you. When I find my daughter, it will be thanks to you."
"You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?"
"I told you, I don't know anything else about it."
What? Who... what do you want then?
Fine. Whatever you want. Can't you just kill me and get it over with?
There's this old man. I've seen him around Riften. I don't know where he lives. I don't know his name.
"Yes, he matches the description of this Esbern guy you're looking for. Maybe it's him. Maybe it isn't."
"That's all I know, okay?"
"Yeah, sure, okay."
"Come on, this way. I've seen the guards use it to get rid of bodies. It must lead somewhere."
Why don't you just kill me already.
"Whatever you want. But let's go, now."
If you like. But we need to find a way to unlock that trap door.
No problem. Thanks for springing me. I owe you. Look me up in Riften if you make it out.
I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of here.
"I damn well hope so. If it helps you twist them up, I'm glad to help."
"They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with dragons, I gathered it from listening to them talk when they thought I was out."
I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him.
"Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name. But they seemed pretty excited about it."
"That's it. Now, let's get out of here."
No. Not again. Help!
So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?
"That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks."
"Have you given my idea any more thought? You said you'd let me know yesterday, and that obviously didn't happen."
"Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'd make more money, but I don't like the idea of you traveling alone out there with the war and talk of dragons."
"Come on now, we discussed that. I wouldn't be traveling all of Skyrim. It'd just to Whiterun and back, that's it."
Tomorrow. I'll let you know tomorrow.
"Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!"
Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise!
"And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!"
"We are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars!"
"But you were once man! Aye! And as man, you said, [QUOTE]Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter.[QUOTE]"
"[QUOTE]I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.[QUOTE]"
"Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!"
"And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!"
The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!
"Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?"
You hear anything?
"No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut it or you'll ruin our ambush."
I don't like it. What are they waiting for?
Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.
"I can't believe it's over. Twenty-five years in exile and just like that, it's done."
All that remains is to ensure the safe return of the Skeleton Key.
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
"When the Skeleton Key was stolen from the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed."
The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.
It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways.
"As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing."
Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while you're away.
And I... I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure to protect the Key.
I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.
I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only.
"Nope, sorry. Nothing."
Let's see here...
"Yeah, got this note."
I have a letter here from Quintus Navale in Windhelm. He said it was urgent.
"I've got a letter and a lot of gold. Something about it being your inheritance? Oh, and... sorry for your loss."
A letter... not sure who from. He wouldn't say. Just that he was a friend of yours.
I have a letter here for you.
"A note from someone named Calcelmo, in Markarth."
It's from... Falk Firebeard at the Blue Palace? You've got friends in high places.
There's a new museum opening up in Dawnstar. The owner is asking me to hand out invitations to travelers.
Looks like that's it. Got to go.
I heard you attacked someone in town recently.
Thought you might be open to doing it again... for a tidy sum.
Heard you hit somebody in town not too long ago.
"I'll pay to do the same, to a certain special someone."
"So you like to hurt people, huh? The town is still talking about what you did."
"You know, I'll pay you to attack one of my enemies..."
Yeah. You beat people up.
"Got someone I want you to hurt. Don't worry, I can pay."
"Uh... yeah. I know you don't mind hurting people. Just look what you did to... well, you know."
I need someone to do that to someone. I'll even pay.
I heard you hurt someone in town not too long ago.
I'll pay you to hurt someone else. Okay?
I heard about what you did. You hurt someone. Bad.
"I got someone who deserves a beating, but I need someone else to do it for me. I can pay."
"Yeah. Uh, I know you hurt someone in town recently."
I'd like to pay you to hurt somebody else. For me.
Idiot! That wasn't the deal. You were just supposed to teach them a lesson. I am not paying you...
They're dead? But now everyone will think I did it!
What have you done? You weren't supposed to murder anyone! Gods...
Good. Wait. Dead? That's not what I asked for. I... uh... you should leave. I need a drink...
"Dead? No, no, no, no, no! This is terrible. I don't know you. Get away from me!"
Shor's bones! What did you do that for? I would have hired the Dark Brotherhood if I'd wanted that! Get away from me.
Really? What did you go and do that for? You... you need to go away.
"No! Tell me you're joking. Sweet Mara, what have I done? Go away. Just go away."
"Oh gods, what did you do that for? This is horrible. I'm not paying for murder. Get away from me."
"What have you done? They'll think I did it. Wait, I did do it! I'm not paying you! This is all your fault!"
"Ha! There's nothing like a few cuts and bruises to drive home a point, huh?"
Good. Maybe things will be different around here from now on.
Good. Let's hope it's a lesson learned.
You what? Oh. That. Good. I hope there was a lot of blood.
"It can't be traced back to me, can it? Was there lot's of crying? I hope so."
Really? I hope it hurt.
Hmph. Good. That'll teach 'em.
Really? Good. Was there a lot of screaming? Never mind. I don't want to know.
Were there tears? I hope everyone can see the bruises.
"Good. I hope it hurt a lot, after all the pain I've been put through."
"No funerals, just some pain. If you get caught, it's not my problem."
"No killing. I'm not hiring the Dark Brotherhood, here. If you get caught, it's not my problem."
"Just cause some pain. I don't want a death on my conscience. If you get caught, it's not my problem."
Hurt him. I mean her. Whichever. No killing though. And I ain't paying your fine if you get caught.
I hope I can hear the screams. But don't let on it's from me! And I'm not paying your fine if you get caught.
"Make it quick, but make it hurt. If you get caught by the guards, I don't know you."
"Good. No killing, though. Don't get arrested. I won't help you."
Make it hurt. But not too much. No killing. And don't let the guards catch you.
"It should hurt. A lot. But I'm not paying for murder. Oh, if you're caught, it's not my problem."
"Good. Now remember - pain, and lots of it. But not to the death. If they arrest you, it's not my problem."
That's too bad.
You have a job to do.
You want to get paid? Do what I hired you for.
"All I can think about is my son, my Thorald... they say that he was killed, but I know better. I know my son is alive!"
"Those Battle-Born... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face!"
"It's not wise to discuss it here. Please, if you truly wish to help, meet me at my home. I'll tell you the whole story."
I just... I just know it. I can feel it in my heart. You have to believe me.
"Please, visit me at my home. I can tell you the whole story."
"Not here. Let's speak at my home, where we can be alone, unwatched."
"Thorald's disappearance has been hard on all of us, but Avulstein has taken it badly."
"He's afraid of being taken as well, so he hasn't left the house. All he talks about is Thorald."
"Please, help Avulstein if you can. Something has to be done, or we're all going to lose our minds."
"But, I need that money! I earned it."
I have my own expenses you know...
Silence!
"Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive."
"But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they?"
"Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself."
You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed.
So he has talked! I knew it!
"Everyone talks, in the end."
"Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment."
Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me.
"You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur?"
"Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers."
"No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside."
That would probably be best.
Now get out!
He can't treat me like that. He needs me.
"Rulindil, pah! One day, the shoe will be on the other foot."
I knew he was telling the truth. I always can tell.
"They're scared of the dragons, too, aren't they? Paying too well. They don't know anything."
"Etienne must know something related to the dragons... who else might know? Greasy Thom... no, they'd see right through him..."
"Mercer's been here, I hope we aren't too late."
We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.
Let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
"Aye, there will be blood today. I can promise you that."
"Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this."
I'd just assume die before I'd let Mercer get those gems.
Do the Falmer also have no sense of smell? This place reeks!
The Eyes would go a long way in helping get the Guild back on its feet.
I can't wait to get my hands around that bastard's neck.
"By Talos, Mercer has a lot to answer for."
This place is coming down. Let's get out of here!
"With any luck, this will be Mercer's final day alive."
"This place, it's like a maze. How did the dwarves find their way around?"
This is just like old times.
"Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer may be blind, but they can still hear us."
"If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again."
We have to get the Key back.
Mercer's here. I can feel it.
"Be careful, there's no telling what lurks within these walls."
Jouane?
"Yes, child?"
"I was just wondering. The next time we meet, do you think maybe you could teach me some fire magic? Nothing dangerous! Maybe a candle lighting spell?"
"By the Eight, keep your voice down! Do you want the entire village to learn our secrets?"
Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
"Shh shh. It's fine, child. It's fine. But we must be cautious, hmm? What we do, the things I teach you. The others wouldn't understand."
I understand. I'm sorry. I just get so excited thinking about it. So... can we. Do some fire magic?
Hmph. Most certainly not. But perhaps I can teach you how to put some candles out. We'll start there.
"Oooh, wonderful! I can't wait!"
"Here you go, sir. The finest Colovian brandy."
Is there anything else I can get for you?
"Here you go, ma'am. The finest Colovian brandy."
Is there anything else I can get for you?
We seem to have run out of Colovian brandy. I'll check in the wine cellar for more when I get a moment.
"Here you go, sir. Colovian brandy."
"Here you go, miss. Colovian brandy."
"I'm sorry, but I think you've had enough for the moment."
"Quintus, could you fetch me a copy of The Firmament? I need to compare the old star charts to today's."
Did they really record the star positions from Curalmil's tomb? There's no way it's that precise.
"Confound it, boy, I know what I'm doing. It will help me determine the season of his burial, which I can cross-reference."
"I... I apologize, master."
"Don't waste time apologizing, just find the book!"
"Master, I have a question about infusions of arrowroot."
"Damn it, child, didn't I tell you to gather my notes on sub-material properties?"
"Yes, and I'm working on it, but I'm also trying to..."
"When I ask you for something, I expect it to get done."
"Yes, master, I know. I just want to keep up my own projects as well."
"You can waste your own time, not mine. An apprentice obeys his master. A good one does, at least."
"Yes, master. I'm sorry, I'll get back to those notes straight away."
"I'm sorry to always be so hard on you, boy. I just worry I don't have much time left."
"I know, master. Don't say such things -- there is always time."
"Don't be so sure. Now, have you finished grinding the dried snowberries?"
"Erm... no. Not yet. I'm sorry, I was reading up on the effects of distillation."
What? You've been lollygagging in idle reading?
No... I was trying to...
Out of my sight!
I see you are eager to carry the light.
"As you venture, Mara fills my mind ever more with visions of love in peril."
"Embers lie nestled in stone, needing only fuel to bloom to a flame that will warm all around them."
"Go to Markarth. There you'll find Calcelmo, wise, acid, and reclusive. Help him to emerge and state his intentions."
This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants.
Tell me about the Great War. I hear you were in the battle of...
"Elda, honey, let's not talk about the war. It's in the past."
I'm sorry. What would you like to talk about?
Hows about we figure out some way to keep warm tonight?
"Oh! You behave, now!"
"How long have you run this place, again?"
"Nearly thirty years, now."
Just wondering when you'll be ready to give it up and settle down. Seems like you're always working.
"I just feel like if I'm not here, then something could go wrong. Nils is a hard worker, but I wouldn't trust him to run things."
One of these days he'll have to learn.
Perhaps. But not today.
I've been thinking about building that cabin we talked about.
Oh? Where?
There's a clear spot just west of Riften. You know the area?
"I've been there before, but I don't know it well."
Well that's where I want to build. In the fall forest. Give it an easterly view. The sunrise is almost as pretty as you are.
That sounds lovely. You're very sweet.
"You're going to get it, Sissel!"
Why? What did I do?
"I told you to weed the garden by sunset, and you didn't do it. Now you're in big trouble!"
"Papa told you to do that, not me! Now leave me alone!"
I guess you had your reasons.
None of my business.
I don't think there's a need for that!
Was that really necessary?
Why are you doing that?
Guess they deserved it...
What's done is done.
Well... that was an unpleasant bit of business.
I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...
Remind me not to make you angry.
"I guess I can look the other way, this time."
"Help yourself, by all means. Who cares if I starve?"
Don't worry about it. Keep it.
I guess you can have that.
You must really need that.
I'll look the other way this time.
I didn't really want that anyway.
I suppose that's yours now.
"Oh, what a clever thief you are."
You could have asked before just taking it.
"You really shouldn't be in here, but I guess since it's you..."
I'll let you stay. This time.
"If you were anyone else, I'd make you leave."
"You're not really supposed to... you know, be here."
You know you're not supposed to be in here right now.
"You're not really allowed in here, you know."
"You can stay, but you're not supposed to be here."
Agh! It... hurts...
If I can just... stand up...
I'll... get you...
This... isn't over...
All right... End it...
Come on. Finish it!
I can't believe it...
Please... mercy...
No... not like this...
Hunh!
Gah!
Yah!
Rargh!
Sigh... I'm not proud of it. I'm terrified of that place and Aunt Agna knows it.
My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt Agna found me.
You fool. You don't stand a chance.
I'm afraid you do.
It is time for us to go.
"Die, worm!"
The College will not fall!
We will prevail!
I'll not go down without a fight!
You dare approach me here? Are you mad? You cannot hope to defeat me!
We knew you would succeed.
Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.
"The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may destroy your College and this world."
It must be secured. Ancano's actions prove that the world is not ready for such a thing.
We shall safeguard it... for now.
"You now have the opportunity to maintain your College, and carry on with your lives."
"You have our gratitude, Arch-Mage."
A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have long believed you would prevail.
Things look quiet enough here. Come on. There's my uncle.
Everybody ready? We charge on my signal.
Time to show what you're really made of.
For the Empire!
Show those thieves not to steal from Lucan Valerius!
"The sooner you find the claw, the sooner our lives can get back to normal."
You're back from Bleak Falls. Did you find anything?
Don't let my sister do anything foolish.
"I don't know what you overheard, but the Riverwood Trader is still open. Feel free to shop."
You're not getting that treasure.
I'm too swift for you!
Too slow!
"Lucan over in the Riverwood Trader says thieves broke into his store. Strange, he says they hardly took anything."
Did you hear? The Riverwood Trader was robbed! Poor Lucan must be torn to pieces over it.
"I heard Lucan yelling the other day about a thief breaking into his store. It wasn't me, honest!"
Maybe you could talk some sense into my pig-headed brother.
Lucan's dead. I guess I'm in charge of the Riverwood Trader now.
I guess Lucan will never see the golden claw again now.
Mara bless you for agreeing to help us.
"If you're going after the claw, you'll need to know the way."
"So, you need a guide out of town after all?"
Bleak Falls Barrow is just outside of town. I can show you.
This way.
"You have the claw. Oh, you have to tell Lucan at once. Hurry!"
Hurry up and tell Lucan you have the claw. He'll be so excited!
"Yes, we did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. Robbers were only after one thing."
"An ornament, solid gold. In the shape of a dragon's claw."
"You mean before he died? We had a break in. Thieves didn't touch anything on the shelves, or any coin, just one thing."
"A solid gold ornament, in the shape of a dragon's claw."
I better get back to cleaning the store. What a mess.
Damn thieves. As if things weren't bad enough.
Where are you going? Come back!
"Wait, come back!"
Noooo!
Aaaaagh!
"Cut me down, or you'll never get the claw!"
Where are you... get me down from this!
"Sorry, but I have a treasure to get to..."
So long [QUOTE]friend.[QUOTE] Ha ha ha!
Good luck. Lucan and I will be waiting for you back in the shop.
You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.
"What? Who are you? Oh, never mind. Cut me down before that thing gets us!"
Stay away! Last time you hurt me.
I don't want to fight you again.
Hey! You're the one that hurt me!
You gonna hurt me again?
You! Don't hurt me! Not again!
I don't want any trouble. Not after what you did to me last time.
You! Back to inflict more pain on me?
I hope you're not planning to attack me again...
"If you provoke me, I will be forced to unsheathe my claws."
I don't want to be hurt again!
"You wouldn't attack an old woman again, would you?"
You here to attack me? I'm ready for you this time.
You have a lot of nerve coming near me again. I'm still sore from what you did to me.
Please! Don't hurt me again!
No! Don't hurt me again!
This one's claws are ready for you should you assault me again.
"If you try to hurt me again, I may have to kill you."
Attack me again and I'll hunt you down!
Ah! No more! Don't hurt me again.
Come back to gloat? I've been beaten by worse than you.
Don't come near me! I don't want to get hurt again.
I hope you're not planning to attack me again...
"Uh, oh. You ain't gonna hurt me again, are ya?"
You're the brute that hurt me before.
Hey! Don't get mad and hurt me again.
"Look, I don't want to get in another brawl with you."
"You wouldn't attack an old man again, would you?"
I don't go down easy if you raise your hand against me again.
"Well, if it isn't the bully that goes around hurting people."
Ah! Are you planning on hurting me again?
"If it's a fight you want, I'm ready this time."
"The College would agree with you, but do you have any idea how many innocent lives were cut short, just so Azura could have revenge?"
"We're nothing to the Daedra. Pawns to move around, praise, and punish as they see fit."
Give me a minute to examine the Star. I'll see what we'll need to do.
"All right, but hurry. Who knows if Azura is watching us?"
"This is High Hrothgar, our temple, sanctuary, and home. We ask that you respect our solitude while you are here."
"Your training proceeds well, Dragonborn."
"What do you need, Dragonborn?"
What is it?
Do you need something?
Eh? Did you say something?
You'll have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in my right ear.
Yes? What is it?
Did you need something?
Drem Yol Lok. Greetings.
Speak. I will listen.
Dovahkiin.


"Ah! You made it! Good to see you, my friend. I'll never forget how you saved my life from those Thalmor maniacs."
So you made it out. Good for you. Don't expect me to thank you. I still remember what you did to me.
"Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!"
"Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!"
Keep an eye out for wolves if you're headed up the path to High Hrothgar.
"What is your need, Dragonborn?"
Lead me into battle.
I answer the call of the Dragonborn.
Lead me into battle.
I serve the Dragonborn.
Lead me into battle.
"You have no business in our stronghold, outlander."
Malacath blesses this land for the Orcs. And the Orcs alone.
"We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here."
Most of my kin are in the longhouse. Come back during the day if you wish to trade.
It's late outlander. Come back in the morning if you need to spend coin.
"We only trade during the day, outlander. At night, most rest in the longhouse."
"I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out."
I have metal to dig.
Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.
Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.
"The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge."
Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own.
"Now if you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going."
"Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga."
"Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization."
They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay.
I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.
There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor.
Have you by chance heard of the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]? Read his cookbook? It's become quite a phenomenon.
"The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and assume the roll of master chef."
Festus has been spearheading this part of the assassination plan. He's close to uncovering the identity of the Gourmet. You should report to him.
"Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is that you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored."
A word of warning though... I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.
"Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Now get going."
Let's show these rebels what real soldiers look like.
"But don't underestimate the Stormcloaks. Many are Legion veterans. They may be traitors, but they know how to fight."
"I see... and this [QUOTE]force of habit,[QUOTE] does it also compel you to murder?"
There's someone that wants to see him put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know.
"Now, you tell me when you're ready and we'll get started."
There's someone that wants to see him put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know.
"I'll be out in the market all day, from eight in the morning until eight in the evening."
Meet me then if you've still got the stomach for it.
When Brynjolf brought you before me I could feel a sudden shift in the wind.
"And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at the end of a blade."
What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises?
"Nocturnal doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the Guild."
Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us?
"When will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from yours?  Both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end."
Then it appears the shadows shroud more than your presence... they blind your wisdom as well.
"Our actions have always been one in the same; both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end."
It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do... as an instrument of limitless wealth.
Instead you've chosen to fall over your own foolish code.
"Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale blood!"
Oh no... what happened here?
Is he... dead?
Is she... dead?
Looks dead to me.
Alright now. Everyone back away. Let the law handle this.
But...
"If anyone saw anything, step forward. Otherwise, step away from the body!"
You there. What do you know about this?
"Hmm... If you happen to recollect anything about the incident, you be sure to report to the captain of the guard."
I've got my eye on you.
Then perhaps you care to explain why you are standing so close a dead body with your weapon drawn?
"Hmmm... You can go, but you stay on your best behavior now."
I've got my eye on you.
"Is that so? Well, perhaps a night in jail might loosen your tongue. Hmmm?"
"Alright, you are now under arrest."
Resisting arrest will mean your death.
You're smarter than you look.
Is that the murderer?
"Not sure, let's watch and find out."
You there! Wait a moment.
"If you beat up my sister Sissel, I won't tell."
Are you new around here? You should go to the inn if you need a place to stay.
Sissel thinks she's so special. No way she's more special than me.
"I'm the older sister, by nearly five minutes. Sissel's barely worthy to walk in my shadow."
"I wish I could be an adventurer like you, and go wherever I want."
"I had a dream that there was a good dragon. He was old and gray, but he wasn't scary."
"Most days, I do all I can to stay away from my sister and my father. The beating's the same from either one."
Some day soon I'll stop being afraid. Jouane is teaching me magic. He says I'm real good.
Do yourself a favor and don't have children. They're good for nothing at all.
"I got enough troubles, so don't go adding to them."
"I spend every day tending the fields, and what do my daughters do? Nothing! Complain and caterwaul! Sleep and eat! Useless!"
Curse my good-for-nothing daughters! My wife was twice the woman they'll ever grow to be. She gave her life birthing them. What a waste.
Did you have any luck talking to my father?
I hope you can change my father's mind. He can be a little stubborn.
"You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something."
"My father, Mralki, manages the inn. He used to be a soldier, but he left that life behind."
"If you need a meal or a room, I've got both."
"I only take real coin here, no handouts and no bartering."
"That fool son of mine, Erik, wants to be an adventurer. He a good-natured lad, but he's got no idea how dangerous the world really is."
"Some folk here will tell you I'm sheltering my boy too much, but I ask you, isn't it a father's duty to keep his children safe?"
"Name's Ennis. If you've got friends who do business in Whiterun, they might know me."
You talk to Reldith yet? She's like a mother to me.
"You here from the city? I visit Whiterun from time to time, mostly to make deals."
"Reldith is the hardest-working farmer in Rorikstead, but I'm the one with a head for business."
"Did you see those guards? Get out of line, and you'll have them to deal with."
"We're honest, hardworking folk here, and we don't suffer beggars or thieves."
"City folk might look down on us, but what's wrong with farming? Everything we've got, we had to earn with our own sweat."
"You look like the adventurous sort. You should talk to Erik, the innkeeper's son. He could use your help."
"If you've got some business in Rorikstead, you should start by speaking to Jouane."
"Sorry, I don't mean to be rude but Jouane's the one who deals with people. I'm afraid I lost my charm years ago."
"No offense intended, but I don't think we have anything to talk about."
"I was a different man, once -- strong, commanding, ah, and young. But the Great War was a long time ago."
"If you're thinking of setting up to farm, you picked the right place."
Peace and prosperity are all the good folk of Rorikstead want in life.
"I'm sure it's hard to believe, but I was once a bold adventurer like you, ready to face any danger."
Have you spoken to Erik? His father won't let him go out and seek his fortune in the world. Maybe you can help.
"Do enjoy your time in Rorikstead. This close to the Reach, well, we are truly blessed to have such fertile ground."
Come to gawk at the Dark Elf?
Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.
"I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer. Not a... a great wanderer, like you."
"No, I want to take my time with it."
Can I help with it? Maybe just the cuirass?
This is more delicate work than you're used to.
I did that engraved piece just last month!
"This is the royal armor, lass. Maybe in a few years."
Did you use my good hammer?
No.
"Blast, girl, I told you to leave my tools alone. You have yours and I have mine."
I didn't touch it!
Hammers don't have legs.
Did you look behind the forge? I think I saw it there.
"Oh... yes. Now that you mention it, I think... sorry about that."
"Captain, captain!"
"What is it now, Viola?"
Did you notice that the snow settles in a different direction near the murder sites?
Don't you think all your tramping around there investigating might have something to do with it?
I... well. Perhaps. But still! It's curious.
Captain Lonely-Gale! I've been looking for you everywhere!
And now you've found me. Can I help you?
Have you thought about my invitation?
"I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
"Oh, I see. Is it still too soon?"
"Yes, I think that must be it. My wife hasn't been gone that long, after all. Ask me again on another day."
"Do you think those dark elves had anything to do with the murders? The attacks all happened at night, after all."
"Viola, dark elves sleep just like the rest of us."
You wouldn't think it from the racket that Cornerclub makes.
"I'm sure the guards have the matter well in hand. Now, if you'll excuse me."
"Hello, captain! Can you spare a moment? I heard something the other day that I wanted to share with you."
What did you hear?
"It was an old Nord proverb. It said, the best way to get over the loss of a lover is to find a new one."
"I didn't lose a lover, Viola, I lost my wife. It's not the same thing."
"Well, if it works in the one case, why not the other? Don't you want to at least give it a try?"
"No, I really don't. It'll be a while before I'm ready for that. I'll be on my way now."
Twilight guide your path.
May Azura's magic protect you.
"This has all been foreseen, and we must play our parts."
Well one of us has to do something!
"I'm searching for my Fenrig. He was marching with Gjukar's men, who they say were wiped out here."
"I've turned over every body, though, and I can't find him."
Please help me look. He has a bright red beard and hair.
"Are you a fool? Look at the bodies around you. Even if you're blind, surely you smell the blood."
"Come, help me search for Fenrig."
Ruki? Where is she?
"We're expected to fight there tomorrow. Gjukar elected to camp here for the night. I don't like it, though."
Our fires are visible for miles. We're in a low valley. Sitting ducks.
"If she's come this far from home, it must be important. Lead on. I just need to report back to camp by sunrise."
Have you been learning your ores?
"I think I've got a handle on it, but Orichalcum is confusing."
Don't even bother with that one. Leave it to the orcs.
"Oh, right. That makes sense. Kind of a messy metal, anyway."
Exactly.
Is Ulfric's armor done yet?
Fenrig! You're alive!
Of course I am. What brings you here?
I had heard that Gjukar's men were wiped out. I came to find you.
"But that battle isn't expected until tomorrow... Ruki, what's going on?"
I'm so confused. What's happening?
It doesn't matter. I'm here. We're together now. And we will be forever.
"How wonderful. Like the sea, their love roils and swells, but brings life and nourishment to all."
We are done talking about this.
"Well what are you going to do then, huh? Let's hear it!"
"Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!"
Nothing? And what of my son? Hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!
"Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better."
"I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?"
Do you believe this old hag?
[QUOTE]Holding him[QUOTE]? Why I've got him in my cellar. He's my prisoner.
"Face it, cow! Your stupid son is dead! He died a Stormcloak traitor. And you... you best keep your mouth shut before you suffer the same."
"Come on, father. There's nothing more to be said here."
"So this is your plan, Lucan?"
"Yes. So now you don't have to go, do you?"
Oh really? Well I think your new helper here needs a guide.
"Wh- no... I.... Oh, by the Eight, fine. But only to the edge of town!"
"Those thieves must be mad, hiding out there. Those old crypts are filled with nothing but traps, trolls, and who knows what else!"
"I wonder why they only stole Lucan's golden claw. I mean, we have plenty of things in the shop that are worth just as much coin."
Lucan found the claw about a year after he opened the store. He never quite explained where he got it. He's a tricky one.
Some fool is opening a museum in Dawnstar. They say he's paying people to collect artifacts from that old Mythic Dawn cult.
"Arch-Mage, the Synod have contacted us again, asking if we've any word on their researchers. What shall I tell them?"
What did you tell them last time?
"That they had arrived, asked for information which was provided to them, and went on their way with no suggestion of further interaction."
"That hasn't changed, has it? Then just tell them again."
Should we consider investigating the matter?
"No, I don't think so. Respond to their request, and we'll leave it at that."
"Yes, Arch-Mage. Thank you."
"Err, excuse me Enthir. Might I have a moment?"
What is it?
"Yes, err, apologies for the intrusion. I was wondering, err, if you could possibly, ah, procure a few select items for me."
"Really, Arniel? Because I seem to recall doing just that for you recently, at which point you assured me that you'd cover my expenses."
"And that, my nervous little friend, has not happened. Would you care to comment on that, perhaps?"
"Ahh, hmm. Yes. I, err, I was unaware that I had forgotten that. I will, err, I mean I'll take care of that as soon as possible."
See that you do.
"So, Arniel. How's that little project of yours coming along? Any progress worth mentioning?"
"Oh, that. Err, yes. It's... It's quite promising, I believe. Definitely on the right track. Results, err, results should be soon."
Right. And what did you say the point of this little venture was?
"Oh, no. Err, wouldn't do to say at all. Not, err, not now. Not at all. I have far too many things to do still."
If you say so.
"You've been spending a fair bit of time with Sergius lately, I see."
"What? Why, the audacity! How dare you imply such a thing!"
Calm down! Why are you over-reacting? I was going to ask if the two of you are collaborating on research!
"Oh! Well... I... I'm sorry. Yes, we have been working on something together."
This is why I avoid being social.
"Ah, my dearest Urag! How are you today, my green-skinned friend?"
"Did you need something, Colette?"
I only wish to escape the constant glaring of my [QUOTE]colleagues[QUOTE] and discover an opportunity for repose. Your Arcanaeum is so lovely and quiet...
I... see.
"Don't fret, my fanged acquaintance. I shan't trouble you a bit."
Was there something specific you needed?
"I'm positive whatever I require will be revealed to me on its own, in due time."
"So, you don't need anything then."
"Oh, my dear Urag. You're trying so hard to help. I do hope you're not disappointed."
"[QUOTE]Disappointed[QUOTE] is not the word I would choose, Colette. Excuse me."
"Mirabelle, would you please make sure my schedule is clear for the next few days? I'm working on something important."
"Your schedule is always clear, Arch-Mage. I see to that."
"Ah, yes. True. Well, thank you."
"Sir, the Imperial Legion has again requested assistance. What shall I tell them?"
"The same thing we've told them before, and the same thing we've told these Stormcloaks. It's not our concern."
"Forgive me, but at what point does it become our concern?"
Never. The College cannot become mired in local politics. What happens inside these walls is our worry. What happens outside is theirs.
"Is there anything new I should be aware of, Mirabelle?"
"I'm dealing with a few new research proposals, evaluating the results of three long-term projects, and keeping an eye on our new Apprentices."
There were also two items requiring disciplinary action recently.
"Everything's under control, then? Right. Keep up the good work."
"Yes, thank you Arch-Mage."
I'm not so sure the few guards they've assigned to the farm are enough.
"It will have to do. Besides, if it came to blows, I'm sure the Snow-Shod's would come out here and assist us."
I suppose so. I just fear they won't make it out here in time.
Just worry about keeping the fields tended and let the Jarl worry about the war.
"My darling, you've made me the happiest woman in all Skyrim."
"It brings me joy to hear that, but what possessed you to say that so suddenly?"
"I've already lost a family, and we're about to start a new one. I don't want that to happen again."
"My sweet Leanora, I will never let anything happen to us. I promise."
"Can you believe we're here? Saarthal, of all places."
I'm surprised that the College is allowed to excavate here.
"I bet your family would be amazed, right?"
Amazed isn't the right word. They might find this... offensive.
"Are you looking for any specific volumes, Drevis?"
"Hmm? Oh, no. No, not really. I... Actually, I've forgotten what I was looking for."
"Ah. Well, then. Let me know if you need anything."
"What's that? Oh yes, yes. Thank you, I will."
"Can I help you with anything, Nirya?"
I was wondering. Has Faralda been in recently? Borrowed any books that you can recall?
Nirya...
"Did she, perhaps, mention any dangerous research she might be working on? Anything that could get her in trouble?"
"I'm here to help you with books, Nirya. That's all."
"Ah, yes. Of course. No, I don't need anything."
Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.
"Can't talk long, got to keep my eyes open for Mercer."
Hold your thoughts 'til after we untangle this mess.
"If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!"
"Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast."
We can talk after I find out what's going on.
I'm relieved Brynjolf has an open mind or that could have gotten bloody.
How can I help?
The time for talk has passed. We must hurry.
"Quickly, what is it?"
"I can't believe this is happening, lad."
"I can't believe this is happening, lass."
Just take a step back and let me figure this out. Then we'll talk.
Can't talk.... I'm outta' here.
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.
I dare Mercer to come back here! He sets one foot in the cistern and I'll cut it off!
Look at that dark elf whore... strutting around like she's innocent. I'll cut her open from gullet to groin!
"I never saw this coming, I thought we were just having a run of bad luck."
So it's true. You've turned traitor. I can't believe it.
I hope he turns up soon... he needs to answer for his betrayal.
I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray all of us like that?
"If you don't have a good reason to be partnered with Karliah, you're dead."
How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that long? Amazing.
"They say that Karliah murdered Gallus, but I'm not so sure."
"If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare hands!"
They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.
Punishment's too good for Mercer Frey. The only penalty for his betrayal is death.
Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for bringing Karliah here.
There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope you find him before he escapes our grasp.
I heard what happened and the Guild owes you thanks for bringing this to light.
I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our noses.
How dare you bring that Dunmer bitch here.
Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.
What in blazes is going on? Are you working with Karliah?
Better question would be [QUOTE]what did he leave.[QUOTE]
Mercer took everything. Even all of our plans are gone.
We've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left. No sign of Mercer.
Any luck on your end?
Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was Gallus's pet project.
"If he gets his hands on them, you can be certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life."
"Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after one of the last greatest heists is just an insult."
"I've spoken to Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she wishes to speak with both of us."
"Quickly, we have no time to lose."
Isn't it amazing?
Just think. We're the first to set foot here in thousands of years.
I can't wait to see what's inside!
Patience. Give me a moment and I'll explain everything.
Delphine! I... it's good to see you. It's been... a long time.
"It's good to see you, too, Esbern. It's been too long, old friend. Too long."
"Well, then. You made it, safe and sound. Good. Come on, I have a place we can talk."
"Orgnar, hold down the bar for a minute, will you?"
"Yeah, sure."
This way.
Now then. I assume you know about...
"Oh yes! Dragonborn! Indeed, yes."
"This changes everything, of course. There's no time to lose. We must locate...  let me show you. I know I had it here, somewhere..."
Give me... just a moment...
"Esbern, what..."
"Ah! Here it is. Come, let me show you."
"You see, right here. Sky Haven Temple, constructed around one of the main Akaviri military camps in the Reach, during their conquest of Skyrim."
Do you know what he's talking about?
"This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all their accumulated dragonlore."
A hedge against the forgetfulness of centuries.
Shh!
"A wise and foresighted policy, in the event."
Despite the far-reaching fame of Alduin's Wall at the time - one of the wonders of the ancient world - its location was lost.
Esbern. What are you getting at?
You mean... you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall?
Either of you?
Let's pretend we haven't. What's Alduin's Wall and what does it have to do with stopping the dragons?
"Sky Haven Temple. An ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach. That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall."
"Alduin's Wall... one of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy."
"Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again."
"Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps..."
Right. Good thing they've already let you into their little cult. Not likely they'd help Esbern or me if we came calling.
We'll look around Sky Haven Temple and see what else the old Blades might have left for us. It's a better hideout than I could have hoped for.
Talos guard you.
"This looks promising. Akaviri stonework, I think. Reminds me a bit of Cloud Ruler Temple."
I think we're getting close. Let's keep moving.
Lead on to Sky Haven Temple.
We'll meet up near Karthspire.
Let's keep moving.
Let's get this door open and see what we've got.
Alduin isn't getting any weaker while we stand around here gawping at the architecture.
"Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy."
"Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see, just forgotten."
The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...
"I'll need this... No, no, useless trash... where'd I put my annotated Anuad?"
"One moment, I know, time is of the essence, but mustn't leave secrets for the Thalmor... there's one more I must bring..."
"Well, I guess that's good enough... let's be off..."
Let's see what Esbern has to say.
"Amazing, eh? To be standing at the very entrance to Sky Haven Temple itself!"
We must be getting close. We should proceed cautiously.
Are you sure this is the right way?
I've told you where Sky Haven Temple is. I'll trust you to get us there in one piece.
I must speak to Delphine at once. There's no time to lose.
So this is where Delphine has been hiding all these years? Hmm.
Are we close? Thalmor spies could be anywhere.
I don't like being out in the open like this.
Did you hear that?
"Oh, Asgeir! My husband! My dear, sweet husband! Why would someone do this to you? Why? This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life!"
"Please, enjoy the festivities! This is a day of peace and happiness, when Imperials and Stormcloaks join together, as equals!"
My wife is dead! Dead!
"Now now, fella. Let's not get too close to my new bride, eh?"
Well aren't you a pretty thing? Should my new bride by worried? He he he he.
Make sure to get yourself something to drink.
"You hungry? There's plenty of food. Eat up, now."
What's going on? Why would somebody do that?
This wedding is boring. I wish they had jugglers.
"When my aunt got married, they had a cake that was three feet tall. I got really sick that day."
I heard Vittoria Vici is the Emperor's cousin. I wish he came to the wedding. I never saw a real live Emperor before.
"By the gods, the blood! The blood!"
"Vittoria did pretty well for herself, marrying that Asgeir. Not a bad looking fellow at all."
"I love weddings, don't you?"
I just can't wait to be a bride someday. Someday...
I didn't do it! You saw! I didn't do it!
"Long as I stay out of the way, the guards don't seem to care about me being here."
I've eaten more in the last two hours than I have in the last two weeks.
"If I'm really lucky, I'll get to kiss the bride for good luck."
The Emperor's cousin is dead! This is a disaster!
"By all the gods, the groom has been killed. At his own wedding! I can only think of my own husband..."
A marriage of both love and political advantage. A rare thing indeed.
"Oh, no no no... This is so wrong..."
I'm so glad Vittoria and Asgeir chose a public reception. That way the entire city can share in their holy bond.
"Oh, did you miss the ceremony? It was rather quick, actually. The couple seemed more concerned with their reception."
I just came to sing! This is a horror show!
"If you want my opinion, I think they should have paid for an entire quartet. Plenty of bards at the College would have loved the opportunity."
"Ahem. Mi mi mi mi. Pardon me. Just, um, warming up. Never know when I may be called upon for a ballad."
My daughter! Dead! Noooooo!
"My nephew, the Emperor. Too busy to attend the wedding of his beloved cousin. We won't stand for this slight, I assure you."
"What my daughter sees in that... barbarian, I'll never know."
"The thought of paying a dowry to that, that... Stormcloak turns my stomach."
It was the Empire killed her! I know it! They killed her so they can blame it on the Stormcloaks!
My son is dead! At his own wedding! Only those Imperial dogs would have dared do something like this! Damn them all to Oblivion!
"I still think my boy should have had a traditional Nord wedding. Outside, in the cool mountain air."
They say this marriage is the first step towards peace. Who in Shor's name wants peace? Pfft.
"My boy, he always did have an eye for the pretty ones. That Vittoria ain't bad, for an Imperial."
"By Ysmir, this is horrible! I never wanted the girl dead, I swear!"
"Vittoria may be pretty, but does she have the right hips for the job? I want grandchildren, and lots of them."
"To think, my little boy is married. And to an Imperial. Oh, they grow up so fast."
"If my Asgeir is happy, then I'm happy. Really."
I never should have taken this job!
"Sorry, no time to talk. I need to keep playing."
What an amazing day this has been. I hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm... I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness... for me.
"Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends [QUOTE]hello[QUOTE] right back at them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks - all are welcome here!"
"Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines!"
"On this glorious day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!"
"Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please - eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!"
"Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin, butchered at her own wedding! Well done!"
Let's see his eminence try to ignore this.
Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
"The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want."
"Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus."
Now go. And give my best to the bride.
"Please, enjoy yourself!"
"She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Aren may be in charge, but Mirabelle runs the place."
You'd do well to remember that.
Looks to be another cold day.
Aren't they all?
Not like this. Feels colder than usual. Bet it's those damned Mages.
I'm sure you're right.
That... wizard is still at the Inn. I can't believe Dagur allows him to stay there.
This is what it's come to. No one seems to care what they've done to our home.
It's clear that memories are far too short.
And it's clear money matters more to Dagur than honor.
"Eirid says the mages at the College are nice people, but you said they're bad."
Eirid's a little girl who doesn't understand that they're responsible for destroying our home.
Why did they do that? Why would they be so evil?
"Because they don't care about you or I, cub. They think they're better than all of us, and that we can just be thrown away."
I hate them.
That's my boy.
"Ooh. What a fun trick. Teach me, teach me!"
"For someone called the [QUOTE]Listener,[QUOTE] you do an awful lot of shouting..."
Is that... the best... you can do...
Ow... It hurts when I laugh. He he...
Have you... gone... completely... mad?
This... this is... an outrage...
It will... take more than that... to stop me...
Oooh. Time to kill?
Finally!
Ooh. That had to hurt.
What? Why would the stranger attack innocent Cicero?
Ow! What did I do?
"What have I done, Listener? Has Cicero offended you?"
"By Sithis, you will pay for that!"
Why you insolent little bastard...
It's... it's like watching an artist create a masterpiece.
And another soul for Sithis.
You are an inspiration. Do you know that?
What do you expect to find? My juggling balls? He he.
"Hey, that's my lint! Ha, Cicero is just joking. You can have it."
"If I had anything worth giving, I'd have offered it already."
Anything good in there?
See if they have any cheese. I'm getting a bit... peckish.
You're putting your hand... in my pocket? Have you gone complete cracked?
I've hardly anything worth pickpocketing...
This how you get your thrills? Feeling up an old man?
I haven't been touched like that since I visited a certain brothel in the city of Sentinel...
It would seem you're not the accomplished pickpocket you think you are...
What do you hope to find? Sweets and my dolly? Or maybe some of my spare Nightshade?
"You're not actually... picking my pocket? Well, you've got guts. I'll give you that."
"What is this madness? Rexus, help me!"
Wait! That's not how this is supposed to work!
What are you doing? I thought we were friends!
You can't be serious.
Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical activity. I seem to be having trouble staying on my feet at the moment.
"Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on, friend."
"Is that all? My friend, you've come to the right person. You could say that causing a scene is somewhat of a specialty of mine."
Stand back and behold my handiwork.
Three in fact. They're my own recipe. Brought them over here from my days as a bartender in Gideon.
"First is the [QUOTE]Velvet Lechance[QUOTE] which is a mixture of blackberry, honey, spiced wine and a touch of nightshade... perfectly safe, I assure you."
"Second, we have the [QUOTE]White-Gold Tower[QUOTE] which is heavy cream with a layer of blended mead, lavender and dragon's tongue on top."
"Last, and only for the bravest of souls, we have the [QUOTE]Cliff Racer[QUOTE] which is Firebrand Wine, Cyrodiilic Brandy, Flin and Sujamma."
I was hoping you'd offer. I didn't think it was my place to ask such a favor of you. I thank you.
I understand. Hopefully I'll be able to save my meager earnings up to buy them one day.
I... I... I don't know what to say. Such kindness is unheard of in these times.
"Here. I want you to accept this as payment for your sacrifice and I... well, we both thank you."
Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design.
"Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife."
"The amethyst in the center represents The Hist, the entity that all Argonians consider a sacred part of our lives."
"Don't mistake my political beliefs as a substitute for my family values. They're still my parents, and I love them dearly."
I just think they've let my sister's death skew their outlook on Ulfric and what he really brings to the table with this war.
I'm not so certain that Ulfric's intentions are as noble as they think. I think Ulfric cares about Ulfric and the rest is a smokescreen.
I'd... appreciate if you kept my opinion between us. The last thing I want to do is have my parents [QUOTE]lose[QUOTE] another child.
"Yes, actually. I'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground."
"We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us."
"My name may not be on the label, but some of my blood, sweat and tears are in every drop. Uh, figuratively of course."
Lady Maven's been developing the secret recipe for Black-Briar Mead over the last several decades.
"She uses a very secret blend of spices, fresh honey from Goldenglow Estate and specially constructed aging casks to ensure the best flavor."
"Even when you get to the last sip in your flagon, it'll taste just as good as the first!"
Damn it! Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
"Look, just don't say anything to Maven, will you? I've spent weeks trying to get that right and if she sees how stupid I am, she'll get rid of me."
Yeah... fired. Sure. That's what I meant.
"She's an absolute pleasure to work for! In fact, I almost feel guilty accepting pay from her."
"Why, just this last week I was commenting to my fellow meadery workers just how lucky we are to be working for such a charitable family."
"That is the truth, my friend! Maven is a saint and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
It's going to take a lot more than that.
"Okay, look. If I'm caught saying anything bad about the meadery or the family, I'm a dead man."
I'm the fourth person to work the tasting counter in the last year. The last three are at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
Just take my advice and just get out of Riften as soon as you can.
Sure am! I thank my lucky stars every time I look to the night sky that Maven took me in and gave me this opportunity.
Only the best in all of Riften! I own Riften Fishery.
"Started out with a single fishing pole and now I have an entire building and two boats to my name. Not bad for a middle-aged Nord, eh?"
"Too bad I haven't had the same success helping this city shed its poverty. Nivenor thinks I'm wasting my time trying, but I disagree."
Nivenor is my wife. How I was ever able to meet such a gorgeous creature is one of life's mysteries.
We're... at odds about my charity. She thinks the people in this town have become lazy and expecting a handout.
"I try to include her in my lessons from Maramal over at the Temple of Mara, but she prefers to shop instead. Different strokes, eh?"
Let me know if you find out anything about the fire.
Hroggar's fate is in your hands.
I hope Alva is not what you think.
<humming>
"That's true, but I'm in a new house now. A better house."
"Yeah, that was a shame."
But now Alva takes care of me. And I take care of her.
She came by so Alva could kiss her goodbye.
Then she left to join the Stormcloaks.
He was cruel to her. He would beat her every night.
It's no wonder she fled in the middle of the night.
Really? How nice.
I have Alva to take care of now. I don't need Helgi anymore.
"Of course! I would do anything for you, my one and truest friend! What do you need from me?"
"Ah, the one generous soul amongst a gathering of pinch-pennies and lick-spittles!"
"If there's anything I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to call upon me!"
"Ah, the nectar of the gods! If there's ever anything I can do for you, just name it!"
"My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that cannot be slaked!"
"And none of the waiters will bring me a drink. Elenwen must have told them to cut me off, the frigid bitch."
"Afraid I'll cause another scene, I suppose..."
Indeed. Being a drunken boor is thirsty work. And I can't seem to find my way back to the bar...
Alms? Alms for a veteran?
Spare a bite for a poor old veteran?
"Please, ma'am, I've got nowhere to go..."
I lost my eye defending the Empire... Spare some grub for a veteran?
I'm sorry...
We barely have enough for ourselves...
"Here, it's all I can spare..."
Sure has been quiet around the shop lately.
We hardly ever get new customers anymore.
"Not that I mind the break, of course. But, still..."
"I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk..."
"It's okay, dear. More work than ever down at the blacksmith."
"We'll make it through, dear. We always do."
Who needs customers and their old junk?
Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!
"Come on, Heimvar. My son could stoke the forge better than you do!"
"You're making progress, Heimvar. But my boy could still work the bellows better than you do!"
"Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for 8 hours straight?"
"Sure, but I bet he can't hold his mead as well as me!"
"Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started!"
Right you are! Guess I'll keep training you... for now.
"How's it coming there, Jawanan?"
"Slow, but looking good, sir."
Slow's the only way to do it! Work too hard and you'll warp the wood.
"Fihada, where did you learn how to make bows so well?"
"The same place I learned my charm and quick wits: I used to be an Imperial ranger, my boy!"
"Wish I could learn some of that charm. I'm just good with bows, not people."
"You'd make a better Imperial ranger than me. I may have charmed the locals, but my fellow soldiers hated my waggling tongue."
"Sister dear, could you try sewing those sleeves a little tighter? We can't have our customers looking sloppy because of your work."
"Oh certainly, dear sister. We couldn't afford to have our customers look like the simple pigs they are, now could we?"
"Good. And while you're at it, perhaps you should sew your mouth shut when our fine customers are within earshot, hrm?"
"Vivienne, could you check out supplies of mandrake root?"
Which one is that again?
It's the root that looks like an ugly little man.
"In that case, I'm pretty sure it tried to buy me a drink last night."
"Sir, we can't just keep trading blows with the rebels like this - it's only strengthening their resolve."
"Your concerns are duly noted, Legate, but unfounded. I assure you, this war will be over in another six months."
"Sir, this is costing lives of both imperial loyalists and Skyrim citizens alike. And it's winning the rebels support where they had none before."
Don't you think I know that? But these commands come straight from Cyrodiil.
"We must maintain order and put the rebellious Jarls in their place, before we have a full scale war on our hands."
"New orders for the soldiers, Legate. Make sure they're distributed as noted."
"Sir, these are missing commands for about half of the commanders."
That is correct. Those orders have been delivered by special courier. I can't trust some of our normal distribution channels.
"Understood, sir."
"Rest up, scum. Probably getting executed tomorrow."
"Yeah, you said that yesterday."
Come now. You'll want to show up in Sovngarde refreshed. You got an eternity of merrimakin' ahead of you.
Guess the headsman's been busy with all your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha!
"Hey, jailor! What I don't understand is why you're siding with the Imperials."
"Shut up, scum."
"I mean, the Redguards fought off the Aldmeri and the Empire, and now Hammerfell is an independent state. That's all we Nords want for Skyrim!"
"I said shut up, scum!"
"So it's okay if your people rebel against the Empire, but not mine?"
"They aren't my [QUOTE]people.[QUOTE] I'm with the Empire because they pay me. And that means I'm out here, and you're in there. So shut up, scum!"
Big shipment coming in later tonight. I need you three working late.
"Oh, we'll make sure it's emptied out by morning. You can trust us!"
"Yeah, we'll get the valuables out of there, no problem!"
"My contact, she says Hammerfell steel is much desired by certain parties."
I know of a ship coming in from Hammerfell. Some cargo might get [QUOTE]lost[QUOTE]...
Why should we settle for half a fin when we could just take the whole whale?
"Patience, sister. Patience."
Got any work?
I ain't begging. I just need a job. Anything.
Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me.
"You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand?"
"Sorry, I have everyone I need at the warehouse. Times are tight."
"My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame Endarie."
"Really? How did we afford that? Besides, I like the gown I already have."
"Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies."
That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone.
"She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others."
"What news have you heard from the war, Irnskar?"
"You won't like it, my lady."
I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me.
"Possession of the holds change on an almost daily basis, but I can report that Haafingar is still secure. Your people are safe."
I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim.
I told you you wouldn't like the news.
"Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us."
"I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics."
"I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger."
"I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you helping the Jarl, Solitude would be weaker."
"You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this."
"One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love."
"Sister, how is my fortune coming along?"
"Profits continue to rise. The warehouse continues to bring in good revenues, and rent on your stores in the Well is acceptable."
I'm afraid [QUOTE]acceptable[QUOTE] just isn't acceptable anymore. I'm sure they can spare a few more coins in monthly rent.
"Yes, brother. I'm sure they'll agree it's a fair price to pay in order to avoid interacting with you on a daily basis."
"Fair or not, they'll pay it, and that's all I need to care about. Bear that in mind, sister."
"That clumsy maid at the palace spilled wine on my best suit. Sister, I believe it's time for a replacement."
"I can commission one from the Radiant Raiment. It won't be cheap, but if you want the best, they're the only choice."
"I swear, those scheming elves charge us twice what anyone else would pay."
"Of course they do, brother. You keep raising their rent."
"Melaran, you lazy milk drinker, have you finished studying the imports from Black Marsh?"
"Indeed I have, sir. Elven weapons for their armies, sir. Elven material, but poor workmanship, like most of what we get from them."
"Scary, thinking of those boots with an army of Elven weapons at their command. Let's be thankful they're half a world away, eh?"
"Even a fine weapon is only as good as its wielder, sir. But they should fetch a high price from the Imperial army."
"Right you are, elf! Or even from the rebels, if they've got enough money to make a competitive offer."
"As always, lord, your loyalty is a shining example to us all."
It's all we've got for today. Don't be greedy.
Fish? Again?
Potatoes? Again?
"Eat up, Svari."
Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.
"We'll make it, Greta. We always have so far..."
Where've you been all day?
"At the market, father."
"Well, did you bring back any mead?"
"I barely make enough for us to eat as it is, father. You can't just drink it all away."
Humph. Some daughter you are.
"Svari, Jala said you stole an apple from her cart yesterday. Is this true?"
Just a little one! I was hungry!
"I'll talk with Jala, dear. I'm sure she'll accept a potato as repayment."
"I suppose. But Svari, we don't steal. We're better than that. Understand?"
"Yes, papa."
"Father, could you clean up the house a little while I'm away?"
Maybe. I'll see if I feel like it.
I'm on my feet all day. Can you please do this one thing for me?
"Sure, whatever."
"A word, my love?"
"What troubles you, darling?"
I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?
"Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses."
"Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious."
"Silana, you don't seem yourself. Is something the matter?"
"Oh, yes sir. I feel many of Solitude's families are having trouble getting by, and the wealthy do nothing to help them!"
"Your compassion is admirable, but you see, we cannot help them all. The poor must learn from the examples of the gods and raise themselves up."
"I respectfully disagree, sir. Stendarr and Zenithar may demand strength from them, but Mara and Dibella demand compassion from us."
"I see you have meditated on this subject quite thoroughly. I shall not stop you, but please, try to attend to your temple duties as well."
"Mistress, a word?"
"Certainly, acolyte. What troubles you?"
"I know you and father Rorlund have many duties to attend to in the temple, but sometimes I feel that there are more important matters to attend to."
"What could be more important than hearing the prayers of the faithful, and answering the questions of the dedicated?"
"Mistress, the people of Solitude are destitute. Many are starving and desperate for work. We need to be more active, to reach out to them."
"We took you in, didn't we? We would be glad to extend our welcome to any other who showed your dedication. What more could we do?"
"I know, and I appreciate it dearly. But I can't help but feel we could be doing more..."
"Kynareth has blessed you with tremendous compassion, Silana. You will find a way, I'm sure of it."
You there. Have you performed your voice exercises today?
"Your solo performance is about a week away. I expect to hear your early rendition tomorrow, understand?"
"Pardon me, but I trust you've been working on your poem, on the classical heroes of Skyrim, yes?"
"Yes, Lady Ateia. My voice is strong as a Dragonborn's!"
"Always! Perfection takes dedication, after all!"
"Yes, madam. I know I have a lot to work on."
I've converted the classic tale of Eyldi the Bear to be performed with drums. I think you'll be impressed!
"At this point, I hardly see how your advice would improve it. It's flawless."
"Oh, thank you! I've been working on an original piece. I hope it can stand up to the classics!"
"Yes sir, Professor Gemane! It's a war epic about Hoag Merkiller's last stand!"
Must it be written? Poetry is so dull when it isn't set to music.
"Why do we always focus on retelling the old stories? There are so many new stories being made, right now..."
"Yes, well, see that you keep at it. That is all."
"I'll be the judge of that. Now, back to your practice."
"Patience, Illdi. We study the heroes of the past so we can have better understanding of the heroes of today... and tomorrow."
I'm sure it will be fine. Just don't be late.
How are your students coming along?
"Yes, headmaster."
Passably. Aia is my star pupil. None of the others can hold a candle to her. Especially not that wretched llldi.
"Some of them have a long way to go, but they're mostly passable. Don't let them hear I said that, though!"
"Bunch of distractions, if you ask me. They just interrupt the rest of my work."
"Try not to play favorites, Lady Ateia. It does a disservice to the whole class."
"Of course not! Complacency is the bane of art. They're in good hands with you, Inge."
"I'm sorry to break it to you, Giraud, but students are an unfortunate necessity of a college. Do try to persevere."
What're you going to do after you graduate? I'm thinking of joining the Legion. I hear they're looking for skalds. Just think. Me - a war bard.
Lady Ateia has already arranged for me to perform in the court of the Jarl of Falkreath.
You'd better hope the war's over by then. The Stormcloaks would eat you alive!
Hmph. Music tames the most savage beasts. Even Nords.
"As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts. Thane Erikur, you have a strong head for business. What do you suggest?"
"This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded."
"Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!"
"And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?"
"Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild."
My lady... Surely you're not that naive. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon.
"The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!"
That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius.
"Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?"
"The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads."
"I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine."
The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons.
My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog.
Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.
Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security.
"That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes."
"Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about."
"I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment."
Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!
"I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor. Who you also serve, technically."
"He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair."
"[QUOTE]Fair[QUOTE] is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this."
"Steward, I will need the following reagents for my studies. Please see to them."
"Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the hold's funds are at this time?"
"Yes, and I'm also aware of how necessary my divinations and wards have been in the city's defense. My experiments are all I ask for in return."
Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased.
And? I've seen jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months.
"Miss Stentor, watch your tongue in the Jarl's court!"
"On threat of what, exactly? This city wouldn't run without me! Now if you'll excuse me, my work awaits."
Make Laelette go away!
I can't tell you. She might hear me. She's so close.
"If you can find me first, I can tell you."
No! You're wrong. You must be wrong. Laelette may have met her fate out in the marsh.
I refuse to believe Alva had anything to do with this. There is no way you can prove it to the Jarl.
"Then... there is hope after all. For so long, all I could do was watch our doom approach, helplessly."
"Dragons, pah. They can be killed. The Blades killed many in their early days as dragon-slayers."
"No, the dragons are merely the final portent of the End of Days."
I tried to tell them. They wouldn't listen. Fools. It's all come true... all I could do was watch our doom approach...
"Oh, yes! The prophecies make clear the signs that will precede the end times. One by one, I have seen them fulfilled."
"We must go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. We have much to discuss."
"Alduin's Wall was created by the ancient Akaviri Dragonguard, the forerunners of the Blades."
"One of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy."
"Its location was lost for centuries, but I know where it is: Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden within the crags of the Reach."
So far so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out.
We need to pass through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder.
"Just stay close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me."
"Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my kitchen."
"A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be."
A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...
"Rules, is it, Tsavani? I didn't realize that eating Moon Sugar was permitted."
Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...
"Tss! Get out of here, I saw nothing."
Of course. Let me see if we have another bottle of that.
I'll be waiting by the door for everyone to be distracted.
Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't screw this up.
Hurry it up. I've got to get back before I'm missed.
"Come on. If someone misses me at the party, we're both dead."
I need to lock the door behind you or the patrols might notice something's wrong.
You should just serve your time. Find an ore vein and start digging.
"You're not in here for life, like I am."
I left behind my daughter Uaile when I was taken.
"How old is my daughter now, I wonder? In prison, you lose track of time."
I'm just another Forsworn sent to rot here in this mine.
You need to not bother me.
"You're talking to a killer, remember that."
You serve your time by digging. So dig.
Prison's not so bad. Less complaints when I kill people.
What?
Cidhna Mine's for prisoner scum only. Keep out.
I'm in charge of the prisoners here.
No funny business. I'm watching you.
"You do something out of line, I'll put you down."
"Don't reach for a shiv around me, or we'll both regret it."
What do you want? Have digging to do.
"Other prisoners get suspicious when we talk to each other, so keep it down."
"Whenever I get out of here, I'm going to go kill a Nord."
I was sent here because someone said I was a Forsworn.
I'm innocent. The Nords framed me. I was nowhere near that murder weapon.
I wonder how grandma Bothela is doing. She's probably worried sick about me.
"What do you want, new blood?"
Jarl decided I was too much of a problem. Threw me in here with the Forsworn.
I got locked up one too many times. Now I'm in for life.
"I swear, if I ever get out of here, I'm giving up thieving. Really."
"You mess with the Silver-Blood family, you end up here."
"I catch you stealing anything, I'll break your neck."
Now this is real guard duty. Just throw them in the mine and be done with it.
Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing.
Your job is to get into the party without being fingered as a spy. I'll take care of the rest.
Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for you.
Don't plan on bringing anything else in with you. The Thalmor take security very seriously.
"Give me what you can't live without, and I'll make sure to get it into the Embassy. The rest is up to you."
"You ready yet? I need to get back before I'm missed. Remember, you won't have anything except what I smuggle in for you."
"Okay. I'll get this inside the Embassy for you. I've got to go. I'll find you at the party, don't worry."
"I'll give you a few more minutes. I can't wait here all day. It's my neck on the line, remember."
You can't go to a party at the Thalmor Embassy dressed like that.
Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?
"Don't worry, it will all be waiting for you when you get back."
Just make sure you get back out of there alive with the information we need.
Good luck.
"This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands here, not least Malborn's life."
"Now do whatever it is you need to do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!"
Good. I have your invitation to the party.
But the only way you're going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an invited guest.
"Which means you need to look the part, and not be armed to the teeth. Here, put this on."
You need to meet with him and give him whatever you think you can't live without while you're inside the embassy.
The Thalmor are paranoid and thorough. You won't get in the front door with anything but the clothes on your back.
"When you're ready, I'll keep the rest of your gear safe until you get back."
"You'll only have what Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside."
"Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over."
"I'm telling you, this one is different..."
"We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself."
"It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!"
"Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then!"
Enchanting services are one of the few things that keep us in touch with the rest of Skyrim.
Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.
Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.
"I'm working on some very important research, I assure you."
"The exact nature of my research is a secret, I'm afraid, but it really is quite valuable."
I don't think anyone here truly understands how useful my work will be.
"When I've finished what I'm working on, everyone will understand its significance."
I have many important things on my mind. Your concerns are not among them.
Are you quite sure we need to be speaking?
I'm disappointed to say I've learned little during my time here.
I had hoped your scholars would be on a level comparable with my own colleagues. They are not.
"We have survived difficult times, and are better mages for it. We owe you that, Arch-Mage. Thank you."
"The Eye of Magnus. Here, but lost. Slipped through our grasp. Oh, what we might have learned."
"I wonder what we could've done with the Eye, had it been put to better use?"
"Have you seen Mirabelle around? I know she's dead, but I thought... Well, I thought she might stop in and say hello anyway."
"You know, they say knowledge is its own reward."
Illusion really is the least appreciated of the schools of magic.
"If only I could be free of the mundane, day-to-day activities life so often requires."
"I'm not one for commendations, but I might've lost everything that matters. So... thanks."
"Arch-Mage or not, my rules about books still stand."
"All this knowledge might have been lost, were it not for you."
I don't want to see you treating any of these books poorly. Are we clear?
"Hundreds of years have gone into assembling this collection. It's going to stay pristine, understand?"
"You need a book, you talk to me. Otherwise you're going to find yourself in a lot of pain."
"I don't care if you wrote it yourself -- if you want a book from here, you go through me."
The Arcanaeum is always accepting new volumes. I'll take what I can get.
We all have you to thank for saving the College. Your position is well-deserved.
Tolfdir as Master Wizard. Certainly didn't anticipate that.
"And to think, Mirabelle questioned my allowing you into the College. I can just imagine the look on her face now."
"If you need any help with Destruction spells, please let me know."
"Mirabelle does a fine job as Master Wizard, I suppose. Still, there's always room for improvement."
I can't wait to see who succeeds Mirabelle. I've no doubt she'll be promoted to Arch-Mage at some point.
Certainly a few of my colleagues aren't quite as talented as they'd like to believe.
Savos Aren is wise beyond his years. He knows real talent when he sees it.
"I'm sure when the time for promotions comes, they'll go to the most deserving mage."
Don't you think I'd make a wonderful Master Wizard? Maybe even Arch-Mage someday?
"Nasty business with that Ancano fellow. Pity that I was unable to assist, but I was... otherwise occupied."
"I care little for idle conversation, but perhaps you need help with Conjuration magic?"
There are few places where one can pursue my type of work without fear of persecution.
That 'incident' in Morthal was just a misunderstanding. No matter what the guards claim.
The people of Skyrim have no appreciation for what we do here. Not that I care.
"Should you ever fall victim to an unfortunate accident, I promise your remains will be put to good use..."
"Restoration is a perfectly valid school of magic, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!"
Why are my research materials constantly disappearing?
"Once again, I have found very insulting notes left in my personal effects. Simply barbaric."
Just because I don't fit in here is no reason for others to ridicule me behind my back.
Ancano is exactly why we're so restrictive about access to the College. We'd all have perished if it weren't for you.
"I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, Arch-Mage."
"May I just say, it's a pleasure to have you leading the College. Really."
"If there's ever any way I can assist you, please let me know."
I think the College is due for a change in leadership.
"If you're working on any experiments, please clean up after yourself."
"Just like anywhere else, it's all about who you know. Lucky for you, you know me."
I hope I can count on you if I ever need a favor.
It's a small group of us here at the College. Favors don't go unremembered. Neither do affronts.
The Arch-Mage triumphant! The College... Skyrim... All of Tamriel owes you a great debt!
I'm quite pleased that we're back to business as usual.
"Certainly nothing illicit going on here, Arch-Mage. You can be quite sure of that."
"Even with the College's laid-back attitude, there are still some things that are off-limits."
"There are some experiments the College frowns on. If they're aware of them, of course."
"If you ever need something, especially something hard to come by, let me know."
I've spent a long time building up a list of contacts for goods from all over Tamriel.
"I am always available should you need me, Arch-Mage."
"Like it or not, you are a shining example to future generations of College Mages."
"After all that it's been through, the College still stands. In no small part thanks to you!"
It's always encouraging to see the younger generations embracing education.
"The College will be here for you, no matter what. We always look after our own."
Education is never appreciated until after the fact. Young people never understand this.
"Have you, by chance, seen my research notes? I seem to have misplaced them."
"Another day, another opportunity to learn!"
"What you learn here will last you a lifetime. Several, if you're talented."
It's no secret that the College's reputation in Skyrim is... tainted.
Please don't do anything to anger the locals. They don't need additional reasons to hate us.
It is not the place of the College to become involved in local politics.
Someday the College may be fully accepted by the Nords. I hope that my work as Arch-Mage may help.
Please don't bother the Arch-Mage unless it's absolutely necessary.
"If there are any problems, let me know. It's my job to keep things running smoothly."
"Day-to-day operations are my responsibility, which means if you become a problem, you get sent to me."
"Mine is not a popular position, but someone needs to keep things running smoothly around here."
"Like it or not, this College is a direct influence on the public's impressions of magic and those that use it."
"It is up to each of us to present ourselves publicly as maturely as possible, and to remain above petty local squabbles."
"I still can't believe it. You, the Arch-Mage? Never would have guessed it."
"You know, this is one of a very few places where you can receive a real education in the schools of magic."
I think my parents reserved a spot for me here at the College on the day I was born.
There's a lot of pressure for me to excel in my studies. I hope I can live up to expectations.
"Thanks to you, the people of Skyrim will continue to have a place to study magic. Even if most of them resent you for it."
"I never would have suspected that the Eye could be so dangerous. Tolfdir is right, isn't he? Magic really can overwhelm you."
I've certainly learned more here than I ever expected to.
I wonder if the College's reptuation will ever recover from our adventures.
The College is a bit of an oddity in Skyrim. Magic isn't something that's looked upon fondly here.
"Nords don't trust magic, or those that use it. Made it difficult for me growing up."
"They won't say much, but most people have very strong opinions about the College and those that study here."
Don't expect the local Nords to take kindly to you once they find out you're from the College.
"J'zargo is pleased, and more than a little jealous, to greet the new Arch-Mage."
J'zargo had expected to be named Arch-Mage. But there is still time.
Are the Arch-Mage's robes as comfortable as J'zargo believes them to be?
Skyrim couldn't be more different from Elsweyr. But magic... Magic's the same no matter where you go.
"J'zargo will go wherever he can to learn more. Oblivion itself, if need be."
"Khajiit are not known as mages, so J'zargo has much to prove."
"J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves, but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he. J'zargo comes out on top."
"I think we could blow up half of Eastmarch, and people would still come to us for enchantments."
"The local Nords may not like us very much, but they don't seem to mind having access to enchanted weapons and armor."
Savos doesn't care for politics. He likes to believe the College is removed from the rest of Skyrim.
"If he could, Savos would float the the entire College above Skyrim, for all the Nords to see."
"Greetings, Arch-Mage."
"May I help you, Arch-Mage?"
"What was that you said, venomous wife of mine?"
"Nothing, you pig-headed oaf!"
"So, you made it out of there alive. Ancano was right... you are dangerous."
"I'm afraid I'll have to take that Staff from you now. Ancano wants it kept safe... oh, and he wants you dead."
Nothing personal.
"You survived! You have it, then?"
Let's hope it's as powerful as the Psijics believe it to be.
What are we waiting for?
"Look around, see if you see anything unusual. Any signs of the mound being disturbed. Anything."
"If my analysis is correct, the dragon buried near Kynesgrove will be the next to come back to life."
We need to find that burial mound before its dragon comes back to life.
This is worse than I thought...
"I'll be damned, you did it!"
"I owe you some answers, don't I?"
Really. We aren't interested in seeing all that. Remove yourself until you are properly attired!
You might consider putting on... something. Anything.
"This one wonders - do you have no clothes, or just like the feel of the wind?"
Gonna get cold tonight. Might want to at least cover your delicates.
Please. Remove your naked obscenity from the company of civilized folk.
Dear. You really ought to put some clothes on. You're embarrassing yourself.
Enough already. Put on some clothes. You're making people nervous.
You're naked!
You must either be crazy or supremely confident to go walking around with no clothes on...
Not sure you should be walking around naked.
It should be embarrassed to be uncovered so.
Umm. You got no clothes. You should get some.
"Naked. Naked, naked, naked!"
Dress yourself.
Ought put on some clothes. Bound to upset some people...
Put on a cloth sack at the very least. You're making me... unseasonably warm...
Aren't you... embarrassed?
You aren't as attractive as you'd like to believe.
"Either I'm drunk, or you're naked. Possibly both."
Cover yourself. Have you no shame?
"Next time, you might want to get dressed before leaving the house."
This one suggests donning some apparel.
"Ysmir's beard, you're going to freeze to death..."
Put on some damn clothes already!
"You really should put on some clothes, you know."
"All right, we've all seen enough. Put on some clothes."
The way you walk around at home is your own business. When you're at home...
"What are you, some kind of barbarian? Don't care for armor?"
It's probably not a good idea to walk around naked like that.
We're here to teach you a lesson.
This'll teach you not to take things that don't belong to you!
The mill!
The flour mill!
The smelter!
Somebody do something!
Hurry!
What's all the commotion?
By the gods!
What in the world...
This can't be happening.
It should be careful with those flames.
"You're not supposed to play with fire, you know."
Take care not to set anything on fire.
You're not afraid you'll set fire to something?
What kind of fool plays with fire like that?
"You're not planning on burning anything with that, are you?"
Careful not to torch anything important.
I do hope you know what you're doing with those flames...
"Try not to set anything on fire, all right?"
Fire is not a thing to be played with...
Careful with that fire.
What's the matter with you? You want to start a blaze?
"Dear, you really ought to be careful with fire."
Better not set anything on fire.
What do you think you're doing? Knock it off with the flames already.
"Is it getting hot, or is it just me?"
Whoa. Hope you know what you're doing with those flames there.
It is planning on starting a fire?
"Hey now, you be careful with that fire."
I wish I could play with fire like that.
Take care with those flames.
"Mind yourself with that fire. Don't burn anything down, now."
"Have a fascination with fire, do we?"
Umm... don't suppose you'd want to take that fire somewhere else? You know... somewhere away from me?
"Careful with those flames, unless you plan on torching something."
Fire!
I do hope you know what your doing with those flames. It would be quite a shame if something caught fire.
"Don't set anything on fire, all right?"
Fire is not a toy.
"Don't go setting the place on fire, okay?"
"Plan on burning everything down, do you? Damn fool."
You should be more careful with those flames.
"Those flames get out of control, and you're gonna wish they hadn't."
"Careful, now. Wouldn't want someone to get... burned."
Careful with that fire.
You've got that fire under control. Right?
Here. For you. For my hatchling of the heart.
I found this. I thought you might like it.
I wanted to give you this. A token of my appreciation.
"Here. It isn't much, but... I hope it's the thought that counts."
I saw this and thought of you. It would be a waste on anyone lesser. I hope you like it.
Um... I was thinking you might like this. Here. It's nothing really.
In dark times friends bring light. This is for you. Thank you for your friendship.
I had to get this for you when I saw it. I hope you like it.
I'm glad we're friends. I have something for you. Here.
This one is honored by your friendship. I hope this gift does honor to you.
"Here's to friendship. A gift! If you don't like it, too bad."
"You're always a sight for sore eyes. Here, I've been hanging on to this for you."
I've been holding on to this for you. I hope you like it.
I have something I want to give to you. Here.
"Here. For you. Don't thank me, just take it."
You always brighten my day a little. Here. I hope you like this.
It's really great we're friends. I was hoping to find some way to thank you. I hope this does the trick.
You are like my brood to me. Here. A token.
You're a good friend. Here. Take this. You'll like it.
So I found something. Here. Take it. I think you'll like it.
Here. This is for you.
"I've been wanting to say thanks for being a friend. Here. It's not much, but I was thinking you might like to have this."
You're not tiresome like the rest of the people I have the displeasure of dealing with on a regular basis. Here. I'd like you to have this.
"So... I've been thinking... I'm grateful we're friends. I'd like you to have this. It's not much, but I hope it's something you like."
A true friend is a gift. Here. I'd like you to have this.
You know... you ain't so bad. Here. Take this...
"When I found this, I immediately thought of you. Here. A small token of my gratitude."
Here. I'd like you to have this as a token my friendship.
You bring a smile to this one's eyes and peace to his heart. Take this. A small token of appreciation.
"In a world of fools, you stand out above the rest. Here, take this small sign of my friendship."
"Here. Something I want you to have. Now, don't embarrass either of us by saying something sappy. Just... take it."
I've been holding onto this for you. Here! I hope you like it.
Here. I want you to have this.
I wanted you to have this. A token of my affection. Don't mean we're engaged or nothin'.
Here. Take this. I hope you like it.
"I got this for you. It's nothing big, but I hope you like it. I want you to know I appreciate your friendship."
Many thanks. Here - a token of gratitude.
Thanks! Here - this is for you.
"I'm grateful for your efforts. Here, take this."
Thanks a lot. Here - a little something for your trouble.
"Here, take this small token of appreciation for your efforts."
Oh. Good job. Here... My way of saying thanks.
Good. Take this token of my gratitude.
"Very well. Here, take this for your troubles."
"Thank you. Please, take this for your efforts."
"Well done. Here, a token of appreciation."
Thank you. Honor dictates something in return. I hope you find this pleasing.
I wasn't sure it'd ever happen. Here. I want you to have this. My way of saying [QUOTE]thanks.[QUOTE]
"Finely done. Here, please accept this gift as a sign of my thanks."
Good. Take this gift. We're even now.
"Wonderful! Here, take this. I hope it's fair compensation."
I couldn't be more pleased. Take this small token of my appreciation.
I'm truly grateful. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
It has done a good thing. It will take this gift as a token of gratitude.
"Ah, good, good. Now please, take this. Just my way of saying thanks."
Thanks a lot! Here. Take this. For all your hard work.
Good job. Please accept this in return.
"Much obliged. Here. It's not much, but take it anyway."
I'm surprised you succeeded. Please accept this as payment.
"Excellent! Thank you... Here, take this as, um, a sign of my gratitude. It's not much, but I hope it's enough."
"Your deed was true, and so is my gratitude. Please take this in return for your efforts."
"Really? Good show. Here, take this. You know, as a thank you."
Fine. Please accept this token of gratitude.
I'm so glad you succeeded. Here. Please take this for your trouble.
"Excellent. And now, please accept this token of appreciation."
"Many thanks. And please, take this gift. I hope it's a fitting token to honor the deed."
Hmph. Hadn't expected you had it in you. Here. Take this for a job well done.
"Well done, indeed. Please accept this as a sign of my thanks."
Very good. But you've created a debt between us. Here. Take this. We are even now.
My joy knows no bounds. Here. A little payment for your troubles.
Good job. Take this in return.
"I can't thank you enough. Here, take this. It's not much, but please accept it as a token of my thanks."
"Now, let us put this behind us and speak of it no more."
"So we're not going to talk about this any more, right? Because I don't want to."
This is last time we speak of this.
"Let's both get on with our lives now, hmm?"
"Now, let's pretend this never happened, shall we?"
"Umm... So, the business is done. This is the last we'll talk about it, right?"
The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.
Now let us turn our conversation away from such unpleasantness.
"Now let's, um, not talk about this anymore. Okay?"
"Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds."
"Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this."
"Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened."
Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.
I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.
Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.
Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.
Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.
"Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?"
Now we never talk about it again. Got it?
"Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?"
Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?
"Anyway, it's done. Time to move on."
But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.
"Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?"
"What happened is between you, me, and Azura. Let's keep it that way."
It's done. No more... no more talking about it.
"Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters."
"Now, let's just pretend this never happened."
I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...
"Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again."
But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.
Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.
Now our business together is done.
I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.
"Let's go our separate ways now, hmm?"
"I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?"
It speaks truthfully.
Um... yeah...
You are correct.
Yep.
Indeed.
Uh... yeah.
You speak the truth.
Indeed.
Yes...
"That is true, yes."
That is so.
Yeah.
Yes dear.
Yeah.
It's true.
Indeed.
Yes.
It speaks the truth.
Yeah.
Ahh... yeah.
Correct.
Yeah.
Indeed.
Umm... yeah.
Indeed.
Um. Yeah.
Indeed.
Yes.
That is the truth.
It is so.
Yeah.
Yes...
Yep.
True enough.
You're correct.
Yes.
It should put on some coverings.
You're naked!
"Put on some clothes, you damned fool."
You ought to cover your... unmentionables.
Even rags would be preferable to your current wardrobe. Or lack thereof...
Careful. They might put you away if you don't at least put on some pants.
I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.
What the..?
What are you doing?
What is the meaning of this?
What's going on?
What in the name of the gods are you doing?
Careful!
"Wait, what are you doing?"
Fool! What do you think you're doing?
Look... You shouldn't be doing that...
"This is going to end horribly, I just know it."
"Gods help us, this can't end well."
Magic. Foul magic...
"Oh, someone's going to get hurt, I just know it..."
Damned wizards and their damned magic...
"Oh goodness, someone's going to get killed."
"Whoa, now... ease off on the magic..."
"Oh, now, that can't be good..."
Someone stop this fool sorcerer before someone gets killed.
Ysmir's beard - I don't like the look of this...
You shouldn't play around with magic like that...
"Mind your tricks, wizard. No need for someone to get hurt..."
I don't know if that's such a good idea...
"Oh, I do not approve at all."
"Oh, no... No, no, no..."
Crazy n'wah - you're trying to get someone killed?
"Oh, great. I'm gonna get killed by a crazy wizard..."
"The world's gone mad with sorcerers now, is that it?"
"Ah, dangerous..."
I think it's time to leave...
"By Ysmir, this will not end well..."
"You're going to get us all killed, you damn fool!"
"Oh, now, do be careful..."
Magic. Great.
"Oh, this is not going to end well..."
You there! What are you doing?
This doesn't look good.
Not now.
I don't want to talk about it.
Not now.
Please... I... not now...
Begone. I have no wish to speak to anyone right now.
"Just go away, please."
Not now.
Have the decency to leave me to my sorrows.
"Not now, please."
Not now.
Get out of here.... I'm in no mood to talk...
Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm upset?
Not now. I'm... much too upset to talk.
"Go on, leave me alone..."
Not now. I'm too upset to talk.
I'm too upset to talk....
"Please, I can't... Just... just go."
Go away.
Leave me.
Go away.
Not now.
I can't talk now.
Now is not a good time. Leave me alone.
Go away... please?
Now is not the time for talk...
"I want a drink, not company. Now go."
"I'm in no mood for conversation. Now go, and leave me be."
"Not now, please. I'm just... too upset to talk."
Go away.
Let me stew. Alone.
Just... get out of my face. I've got nothing to say.
Please... I... I can't talk to you right now...
Go away. Now.
Leave me alone... I'm in no mood for talking.
Not now.
Look... Now's not a good time...
How are we doing over here?
You want another one of those?
There's plenty more where that came from. Just give a holler.
Many thanks!
"Oh, thank you!"
Thanks.
Thank you!
Well. I do suppose thanks are in order. So... my thanks.
Thanks!
Azura bless you.
I suppose thanks are in order.
Thank you.
Many thanks!
Gods' blessings on you.
Thanks. I guess.
"Thank you, dear."
Malacath preserve you.
Thanks!
Well now. I guess I owe you my thanks.
Thanks a lot!
My thanks to you.
Thanks!
Thanks a lot!
Thanks.
Thank you!
"Yes, yes, thank you and all that."
Thanks!
Azura bless you.
Thanks!
I suppose thanks are in order.
Thank you.
Many thanks.
Ysmir's blessing on you.
Thanks. I guess.
"Thank you, oh thank you."
"Ah, my thanks. Malacath watch over ya."
Thank you.
Thanks!
Thanks a lot!
Gods be praised.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Beg pardon. You dropped some armor over there. Don't suppose you'd mind if I... took it?
"Umm... You dropped a piece armor over there. I was kind of hoping that I could, you know, have it?"
"Excuse me. I'm assuming that armor you got rid of wasn't an accident, but just in case, I wanted to make sure I could take it."
"That armor you got rid of. I can have it, yeah?"
"Pardon. I saw you toss a piece of armor. You wouldn't mind if I take it, then?"
"Couldn't help but notice, that, um... you dropped some armor. Just wanted to check with you before I took it. Is that all right?"
"Hey. That armor. You got rid of it, yeah? I can take it, no problem?"
If you're not going use that armor you dropped... do you mind if I take it?
That's great. I owe you one. Thanks!
"Oh, well, um... thank you."
Thanks! I'm going to go put it on right now.
Mighty decent of you.
My thanks!
Well great! Let's see anyone try to hurt me now...
Best luck I've had all day.
I'm going to go get it right now and wear it. Many thanks!
"Oh. Well, you should probably go get it before someone steals it."
"Well... you probably should go collect it before someone else does, shouldn't you?"
Oh... well. Never mind then.
Well what did you go dropping it for? Got my hopes up for nothin'...
"You dropped it by mistake? Well, if I was you, I'd go grab it now before somebody does."
Aww. I thought you were done with it.
Well... fine. I wasn't really gonna do anything with it anyway. Hmph.
"Well, you'd better go pick it up then, before someone snatches it."
"Alduin, thuri! Boaan tiid vokriiha suleyksejun kruziik?"
"Geh, Sahloknir, kaali mir."
Good. It's done.
"Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order."
I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.
And Elisif?
And Erikur?
Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.
Don't you worry about him. I've sent my best men to round him up.
"Oh, and Legate. It's been an honor to have you at my side. As a token of my appreciation, I want you to keep my sword."
"And now, to deliver a speech."
"Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation."
"Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks."
"The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks."
"Very good. Come, the people await us."
"Oh, why is that?"
"On the contrary, you exceed the rest."
"But, I will honor your request. The gods know of your victories, and they themselves will glory in your deeds."
There's no shame in such thoughts. A man without doubts is a man without a conscience.
"But rest assured. We've won Skyrim's right to determine her own future. And for that, every Nord praises us."
But I will heed your wishes.
"A man's heart is his own burden to bear, so I will honor your request, though it casts a bit of gloom on an otherwise glorious day."
"Come, at the very least walk out with me."
"And now, I present to you, Ulfric Stormcloak, hero of the people, liberator and High King of Skyrim!"
"I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn."
"I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the woman we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn."
I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak...
"And indeed, there are many that call us heroes."
"And indeed, there are many that call me hero."
But it is all of you who are the true heroes!
"It was you who fought a dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down with it."
It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would have us deny our gods and our heritage.
"It was you who fought your kin who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price of our freedom."
"But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim, for our right to fight our own battles..."
"To return to our glory and traditions, to determine our own future!"
Huzzah!
And it is for these reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of [QUOTE]High King.[QUOTE]
Not until the Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.
And what about Jarl Elisif?
And what about Jarl Erikur?
"Yes, what about the Lady Elisif?"
"Will she put aside her personal hatred for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that the suffering of our people will end?"
Will she acknowledge that it is we Nord's who will determine Skyrim's future?
"Will she swear fealty to me, so all may know that we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?"
"Yes, what about Jarl Erikur?"
Will he cast aside the Imperial coin falling into his coffers?
Will he acknowledge that we Nords deserve to determine our own future?
"Will he swear fealty to me, that all may know we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?"
I do!
I do!
"Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule Solitude, I will garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city."
"And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King once and for all."
"There is much to do, and I need every able bodied man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim."
"A great darkness is growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or abroad."
"The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has not defeated Skyrim!"
How'd I do?
"Eh, not so bad."
Nice touch about the High King.
"Thank you, I thought so, too."
"It's a foregone conclusion, you know."
"Oh, I know."
The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in the hills.
"They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever they can."
"I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give up and go home."
"What I fear, is that the Thalmor will see our victory here and turn greater attention to our shores."
We must be prepared to face them.
Aye.
"And of course, we couldn't have done it without you."
May the gods preserve you.
May the gods preserve us all.
"Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do."
"Bring up some more mead, my boy. This cask's nearly tapped!"
"Yes, father. Which cask should we open?"
"Just bring any of them, lad! Can't risk thirsty customers without mead to drink, even for a second!"
Any of them! Just hurry up! No time for a debate when customers are thirsty!
"Bring the Blackbriar 195 Berry-Blend. It should be at its peak right now, and if it doesn't get served soon, it'll only go bad."
We just got a cask of Old Gold 200 that has a crack in it. Better serve it now before it goes bad.
Fat Toad 190 is always a crowd-pleaser. Father could probably charge extra.
"Good idea, sis. Maybe you ought to be in charge!"
"Yes, yes, fine. Just hurry! Mustn't keep the customers thirsty!"
"It's been a good week, my boy! Loud customers mean good cheer, and good cheer means a full till!"
"You know, I ought to retire and leave you to run the Skeever, son!"
"I don't know, father... There's a whole world out there I want to see."
"You'd just spend your time here, bossing me around and yelling for more drinks. You're practically retired already..."
I could run the Skeever! You even said I'm almost as smart as you!
Why not let me run the Skeever? I already know lots about it!
Don't be a silly girl! Running a bar's no job for a young lady.
"Hah! A girl running a bar? Don't be ridiculous, Minette!"
"What about [QUOTE]Auntie Faida[QUOTE] in Dragon Bridge? She runs a bar, and you said she's one of your favorite girls!"
But you always say you want more girls in the bar to begin with!
"Oh, brother..."
Hah!
"That's it! I'm not retiring, ever! End of discussion!"
"Well, you see, that's a little complicated, and... you know what? Never mind. Guess I'm not retiring anytime soon."
A round for all of my friends!
"Another round, on me!"
You heard the man! Drink and be merry!
Let's hear it for our kind benefactor!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Free mead!
"Can I buy you a drink, darling?"
"So, um, mind if I buy you a drink?"
This drink's on me.
Not if you were the last man in the Empire.
"Oh, if you insist!"
You can buy me whatever you want!
"Aw, that's so sweet of you! Thanks!"
"Being friends with the bartender's son has its advantages, huh?"
"Oh, yes please!"
Bet I can reach the bottom of this flagon before you!
Bet I can down this ale faster than you!
You're on! Loser buys the next round!
"In your dreams! If I win, the next round's on you!"
"Viarmo, the college really must take a stand on the war!"
"Viarmo, don't you think it's time that the Bards College officially declared support for the empire?"
"Lady Ateia, it is the official position of the college to remain neutral in all political affairs. We cannot risk our history by choosing sides."
"Now, now, our duty is to record the great tales of history, not to pick sides in them. Best to stay out of the warfare, I feel."
But I'm sure those Skyrim dogs would stand down if the keepers of the tales showed their patriotism!
"Maybe if we stopped singing about their silly Nord heroes, the rebels would stop making such a fuss!"
"Aia, please be quiet. Viarmo and I are discussing matters of national politics."
"Aia, this is a delicate matter. Why don't you review your lessons and be silent for a while."
"Pantea, perhaps you should attend to your students, and leave the politics to me."
"That is precisely why we remain neutral. Ours is to tell tales of empires, not to make or break them."
Tag! You're it!
I'm bored! Let's play a game!
Can't catch me!
"Aww, I'm hungry! Can we get some food, instead?"
"I'm not playing with you, Kayd! You play mean!"
Father says I shouldn't play with you anymore.
You learn a new word like a master... you truly do have the gift.
Gods above! Look at that!
Kill the damn dragon! Unless you have a better idea?!
Stay under cover. This is what we came for. We need to see what happens.
Steady. Let's see what it does.
Come on. We need to find out what's happening up there!
"Lorkhan's eyes! Look at that big bastard! Keep your head down, let's see what it does."
"Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes."
"But never mind that, even though you fouled up the job I still think you've got that spark I'm looking for."
There's plenty of gold out there for the taking... if you're up to the challenge.
"Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes."
"But never mind that, you did the job and you did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from... if you think you can handle it."
"All right, then. Let's put that to the test."
The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got what it takes.
"Look, I'll make this simple for you."
The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
"When you make up your mind, come find me there and we'll talk about your future."
"Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up."
The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
"When you come to your senses, find me there and we'll discuss your future."
Find anything worthwhile yet?
Can't say that I have.
Quiet! I think I heard something.
This place has had you shaking in your armor ever since we arrived.
"I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's move on."
"When I'm done here, I'd be more than happy to sell you an elixir."
"Please, please... hold all your questions until after I've finished!"
"Oh, excuse me, milord. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people."
"Oh, excuse me, milady. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people."
What wasn't I clear about?
"Okay lad, ready to make some coin?"
"Okay lass, ready to make some coin?"
Changed your mind I hope?
Glad to see you finally came to to your senses. Ready to make some coin?
"Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lad?"
"Running a little light in the pockets, lad?"
"Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lass?"
"Running a little light in the pockets, lass?"
I'm saying you've got the coin but you didn't earn a septim of it honestly. I can tell.
Your pockets... they're a little low on coin. I can tell.
"It's all about sizing up your mark, lad."
"The way they walk, what they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway."
"It's all about sizing up your mark, lass."
"The way they walk, what they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway."
"Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lad. Wealth is my business."
Maybe you'd like a taste?
"Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lass. Wealth is my business."
Maybe you'd like a taste?
"I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of hands."
"And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid."
Simple... I'm going to cause a distraction and you're going to steal Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand.
"Once you have it, I want you to place it in Brand-Shei's pocket without him noticing."
Sorry... I usually have a nose for this kind of thing.
"Never mind then, lad. If you change your mind, come find me."
Sorry... I usually have a nose for this kind of thing.
"Never mind then, lass. If you change your mind, come find me."
"You're trying my patience, lad."
"You're trying my patience, lass."
"You're right, I forget myself. I've lived without hope for so long..."
The prophecies are clear. Only the Dragonborn can stop Alduin.
What? You're... can it really be true? Dragonborn?
Then... there is hope! The gods have not abandoned us! We must... we must...
"Kharag, take a break and drink with me! Those trees aren't going anywhere!"
"Why so glum, my ugly friend? Did we run out of mead?"
I have to work twice as hard because you drink up all our profits.
"Can you pay attention to work for once, instead of your mug?"
What did you say? I ought to break off one of those tusks and use it as my drinking horn!
Don't make me to defend the honor of my mead! It's been my friend a lot longer than you have!
"Hjorunn, the last time you tried anything, your fist broke on my head!"
"Just as long as you don't breathe on me, Hjorunn. I'll be out for hours."
"Guess we can't afford to miss that much work, can we? Oh well..."
"True enough, you cur. Back to work, I suppose..."
"Another gorgeous gray day, right dear?"
"It's too cold for my bones, but that never seems to stop you, dear."
I'm gonna go play soldier with a tree!
"That's nice, son. Just don't stomp on the crop like last time!"
"I'll see if I can't get some work done inside, where it's warm."
Bassianus is still so terrified of Jofthor.
"If he knew that I'd keep him from hunting the poor boy down, he'd take Fastred to Riften without a second thought."
Let him know that I'll watch out for them. I just want my daughter to be happy.
"Have you spoken to my parents yet? Please, my love depends on it!"
"She would? If she's willing to deal with him, then everything would be all right."
I'll... I'll go speak to Fastred. Post-haste!
As do I. It's a puzzling situation.
I guess not.
"That's the trouble. I know Faleen from the Keep, but I have no idea what sorts of things she likes."
It's not a simple matter. I could offend her fairly easily by bringing up the wrong subject. I've seen it happen before.
"What? Why, are you... interested?"
What is it doing? Walking around nearly naked...
Oh! Look over there!
That's certainly unusual.
Some folk - they got no shame.
Well now! That's a shamefully absurd way to go around in public.
Ummm... they'd lock me up if I went around like that.
What is that half-naked fetcher trying to prove?
What a vulgar display.
That's not something you see every day...
Gracious! This one is certainly unaccustomed to such sights...
Well now! Aren't you putting on quite the show?
"Shameful, really. I blame the parents."
"Oh, dear. Would you look at that? How embarrassing."
Look at that fool.
Gah! Look over there. I can't believe it.
It takes a lot of confidence to walk around naked. Trust me on that.
Whoa.
"Crazy person... Something must be wrong with its head, to strut around like that."
They're half-naked. That ain't right. Somebody's gotta say somethin'...
Look! Look!
Somebody get that idiot some armor...
"A bit much, going around like that..."
Why the impropriety!
Never see me strutting around like that!
"Crazy, naked n'wah..."
Whoa... Not even I'm that drunk...
Positively vulgar.
Somebody get that fool a blanket.
"Despite the shame, this one can't help but stare."
By Ysmir's beard! I didn't know it was gonna be a party!
For shame! You should be locked up for strutting around like that.
Oh my. Been a lot of years since I've seen something like that...
Got to admire the chops it takes to walk around like that.
"Not my thing, but who am I to judge..."
Wait until the boys hear about this.
"Now that's something else, right there!"
You caught me! I surrender! Ha ha ha ha.
"Do what you will. Cicero has no fight left. In the end, Sithis will judge us both."
"Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks. But what of the fool? Is Cicero dead?"
"Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative!"
"But killing me would be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's your mother too, isn't she... Listener?"
"Walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!"
"Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused... and they say I'm mad!"
"If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener?"
"So walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!"
"Oh, you prefer to listen, eh? Of course, of course! The Listener listens! A joke! A funny joke! I get it."
"Then listen to this - don't kill me. Let poor Cicero live! I attacked the strumpet Astrid, I did! And I'd do it again! Anything for our mother!"
"Return to the pretender, tell her I'm dead! Tell her you strangled me with my own intestines! Ha ha! But lie! Yes, lie! Lie, and let me live!"
"So, what's the latest exciting news about goings-on in Winterhold?"
"There is no news, I'm afraid."
"None? Nothing at all? Nothing from the College, even?"
I shall inform you the moment something noteworthy happens.
"Yes, that will be fine. Thank you."
Will you be needing anything special today?
Why don't you see if Arch-Mage Aren is interested in joining me for a meal?
Again? Are you sure? He still hasn't answered your last several requests.
"Well, he's been very busy. Perhaps today he'll have some free time."
As you wish.
"Malur, I need you to take care of something."
"No, I don't think so. Not today."
I haven't even said what it is.
"Doesn't really matter. Thanks, but no."
You must deliver those items to your superior. And I... I must get out of this foul place.
I don't even know what to think anymore...
"Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!"
I... knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends.
Is this punishment for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so?
I do the cookin' and cleanin' round the palace.
Don't need to pay me no mind. I'm the least important person in here.
"Keepin' the palace clean an' the lords fed ain't easy work, but it's honest work."
"Every night, I walk around the Gray Quarter and let them gray-skins know what I think of 'em."
"We ought dig a big hole, throw all them dark elves and Argonians in it, and let 'em tear each other to pieces."
Only thing I hate worse than those scale-backs are them filthy gray-skins!
The Gray Quarter's a disgrace. Them dark elves live like animals.
Can't see why we let them dark elves live inside the walls. We should kick 'em out like we did to the scalebacks.
"Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man."
"Skyrim isn't very friendly for Argonians, so we mostly just keep out of the way."
"Shahvee knows the dock doesn't look nice, but fresh air is good for the gills."
Good honest work staves off the cold.
I like to bring Grimvar down here sometimes. It reminds him how lucky he is.
"I try to keep Grimvar safe, but these are dangerous times."
When Grimvar asks me why women are being killed around the city. I don't even know what to say to him.
Ever tried taking care of children? It can be a nightmare.
We can't thank you enough for helping us get this office running.
"Hey, it's our hero! Seen any more of those pirates around here?"
"I appreciate everything you've done for us, but I really am quite busy."
"To receive the blessing of Talos, you have only to pray at the altar."
Ulfric Stormcloak was a true hero of Skyrim. He stood up to the Thalmor and refused to turn his back on Talos.
"The Stormcloaks are gone, but Talos will never be forgotten. I don't care what the Thalmor say!"
You know about Talos? He founded the Empire!
We're the only Temple in Skyrim that can openly worship Talos.
"Those awful Thalmor can't touch us, thanks to Ulfric."
I can't believe the Empire would turn its back on Talos.
"Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milord?"
"Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milady?"
Spare a coin? Talos rewards the generous.
I hope the wind dies down a bit before tonight. Hard when you've got to sleep outside.
"Nervous being alone at night. Especially these days, with the Butcher prowling the streets."
Looking for shipping? We'll always offer better service than the East Empire Company.
These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.
You hear about the Shatter-shield girl? It's a tragedy.
"Torbjorn wants the shipping operations to bring in cash, and I make it happen."
Come see me in the marketplace tomorrow. You won't find better prices in all of Eastmarch.
"I don't haggle. If you want a lower price, look elsewhere."
"I'd travel more, but who wants to deal with all the soldiers these days?"
"If you're looking to get a drink, Candlehearth Hall's got warm fires and strong ale."
Horses. All day long. Do you have any idea how dull horses are?
"If the guards would listen to Viola, they'd have caught the Butcher by now."
"I love my husband, but he can be a bit... dull at times."
Ugh. I'll need to bathe thoroughly to get this stench off of me.
Looking for something?
Real Nords like to prove their mettle in the pit.
"Just between you and me, I wouldn't mind if the Empire just up and left for good."
I'd love get one of those Imperial weasels under my boot...
I've been a bit out of sorts since... since our daughter was taken from us.
Not really sure what to do with myself anymore. I just miss her so much.
"I try not to think of her, but sometimes the simplest thing will remind me."
No mother should have to bury her daughter.
This is the Hall of the Dead. Someday you'll end up here.
My job's simple enough. The dead don't really complain much.
"Luckily Windhelm is cold, so the dead don't rot as quickly. Sometimes the burial has to wait for the ground to thaw, though."
Another Dark Elf. Just what Windhelm needs.
Maybe you should just move along.
"This here's Candlehearth Hall. Great room's upstairs, an' there's a bed for rent on the ground floor."
"Got some fresh-baked bread an' good cheese, if you're after a bite to eat."
"Mind you don't get fresh with Susanna. She plays the flirt, but it's just to get good tips."
Those Dark Elf refugees will take over the city if we aren't careful.
Be on the lookout. The Butcher could be around any corner!
"Captain Lonely-Gale has been avoiding me, I just know it."
"After what happened to those other women, I'm worried about my own safety."
"Women murdered time and again, and all the guards care about is the war."
How can Elda hate the dark elves when she knows so little about them?
"You didn't hear it from me, but if you want a real drink, try the Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter."
Did you know that candle on the mantle hasn't gone out in over a hundred years?
"Stand away from me, or I'll crack you like an egg."
What are you looking at? Scared of strong women?
You look mighty tasty. Better not stick around for supper.
Working in Windhelm is great. I get to see Ulfric up close.
"I never expected Ulfric to live up to his legend, but he does."
Ulfric was a true hero of Skyrim. He will be missed.
I just can't believe that Ulfric is gone. Skyrim will never be free now.
I couldn't ask for a better teacher than Oengul.
"It's a new day in Windhelm. The Stormcloaks are gone, and so is their prejudice."
"I wish the Nords, Argonians and dark elves in Windhelm got along better."
We Argonians do the work the Nords don't want to do.
"The water is cold, but it's a lot better than having to work up in the dry air."
"Shatter-Shield, East Empire Company... we'll work for any ship that pulls in, as long as they can pay."
"The Nords don't appreciate us, but so what? I don't appreciate them right back."
"Look, we don't have much love for your kind down here. Probably best if you just left."
"Haven't seen you here before, egg brother. Welcome!"
"Haven't seen you here before, egg sister. Welcome!"
The docks can be a dangerous place. Don't expect me to save you if you fall in.
Huh? What's that now? Leave me alone.
"Another day, another septim."
The young folks are too happy to break their backs for the Nords. They forget what it was like to swim free.
Do you know my father? He's really important. He even talks to the Jarl sometimes.
Did you know my father? He was really important. He even talked to the Jarl sometimes.
"All the Argonians at the docks are nice to me. Good thing, too, or father would run them off!"
They say dragons are coming back. I want to kill one!
"I made my fortune as a sea captain, but now I'm retired."
The townsfolk call me [QUOTE]captain[QUOTE] because I used to be a sailor.
"I lost my family years ago. Truth is, I don't really know what keeps me going."
Did Viola send you to bother me?
"Serving as Steward to Ulfric Stormcloak was a great honor, but I don't miss his temper."
"I don't care that we lost, I'm just glad the war is over."
The Stormcloaks are finding victory across the land.
"I'm not much of a strategist, but Lord Ulfric listens to my counsel all the same."
"If you have any news of the western holds, take it to Ulfric immediately."
"Terrible shame, what happened to those women."
"I was one of the best soldiers in the Stormcloak army, until I took a sword through the chest."
I'd be out there fighting the Imperials right now if it wasn't for my war-wound.
"Ever since that Imperial craven ran me through from behind, I've had trouble breathing. Don't have any trouble drinking though."
"What? Were you hoping to claim this house for yourself? Well, the Aretinos always liked me, so I think I'm family enough to take up here."
The milk drinkers in this town wouldn't last five minutes in a real battle.
Rumor holds that the Aretino boy brought an assassin here. Sounds like nonsense to me.
"I once killed six men, single-handed, while rescuing my brothers-in-arms from ambush by an Imperial patrol."
I'm not too proud to admit that I need a bit of help from time to time.
Can't say I mind the sight of all the Imperial guards. It's a change for the better.
"All my goods are legitimate, which is more than I can say for some."
I like to share my good fortune with those who deserve it.
"Trader dropped by recently with some lovely pieces, if you'd like to have a look."
Pardon the mess. We're really trying to do better around here.
[QUOTE]Windhelm's an easy posting![QUOTE] they said. Guess they didn't count on Ulfric's little uprising.
Can you believe the company won't even dock ships here anymore?
The conquering hero returns!
I really can't thank you enough for your help.
I still can't believe Isabella's gone. She was such a helpful young lass.
"Now more than ever, the world needs tales of heroism."
I'll find some way to finish my book.
Know any tales of nobility and courage? I'm keen to record them.
"Oh splendid, another Nord."
"Come slumming to the Gray Quarter, have you?"
"Welcome, brother. Please, enjoy yourself."
"Welcome, sister. Please, enjoy yourself."
Apparently some Nord women were murdered. Not sure why I should care.
"At long last, Windhelm is free. No longer must we suffer persecution at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak."
Things have been a lot worse around here since Ulfric took over.
It's not the cold of Skyrim that gets to me. It's the stink from the people.
"When I've made enough money, I'm going to return to Morrowind in high style."
Both my daughters. Now my wife? How much is one man supposed to take?
Poor Nilsine has been wrecked since her sister was killed.
Seeing a good tavern brawl might be just the thing to lift my spirits.
Brond's one of the most savage fighters I've ever seen...
"What I lack in strength, I make up for with tenacity."
"You need anything, come see me. I'm as resourceful as I am discreet."
"I have a lot of respect for Ambarys Rendar, but his views are a little extreme."
You look like someone who appreciates nice things.
"Oh, pardon me. Was I in your way?"
I hope someday we'll get to know each other better.
I see why the Nords like Skyrim. This crisp air is wonderful for the lungs!
You seem like such a nice person. I'd love to hear more about you.
"Can't believe Ulfric's gone. If not for Hermir, I'd have left the city by now."
Everyone says Eorlund Gray-Mane is the best smith in Skyrim. I plan to change a few minds about that.
Need some metal hammered?
Hermir's become a decent smith. Like to think I had a hand in that.
"With my swords in their hands, Ulfric's men will send those legion dogs running."
I lost my twin sister a while back. Have you ever lost anyone close?
My father says we need to just get on with our lives. Like it's that easy.
I've been a lot of things in my life. Pit fighter's the one I'm best at.
We should get a dragon for the Pit. I'd love to fight one.
I've been fighting in the Pit for years. That should tell you something.
There's two kinds of Pit fighters -- good ones and dead ones.
"Ulfric once tried to get me to fight for him, but marching bores me."
Steel. Barehanded. Armor. Naked. It's all fighting. I can kill you with a weapon or by myself. No difference.
"With Ulfric dead and the Stormcloaks gone, who will have the courage to champion the cause of Talos?"
"I've spent my life serving Talos. I don't plan to stop now, no matter what the Empire says."
Talos created the Empire. You'd think they'd show him more respect.
"The way I see it, Ulfric's fighting a holy war."
"Someday all of Skyrim will worship Talos openly, as we do here."
Whatever you've heard I can do is probably true.
"If Ulfric needs a favor, he has it. Anyone else better pay well for the service."
"I'd explain my research, but you'd just be confused."
"Yes, I'm a powerful wizard. No, I won't put on a magic show for you."
"My job? Well, I'm the Watcher of the Wheel! Which is... exactly what it sounds like. I watch the Wheel."
"Watching the wheel isn't as simple as you might think. Have to inspect all the way around the ice, make sure it's not melting."
Don't get too many folks up here these days. Sometimes I think they've forgotten about me.
"My time is limited, so speak quickly."
"It'll take time to rebuild, but the Nords are no strangers to hard work."
"The dark elves and Argonians won't soon forget Ulfric's prejudice, but I'm doing what I can to repair that rift."
"Being a Jarl isn't something I ever wanted, but if I can help these people, then I will."
Got no time for a Nord who thinks he's better than everyone else. Keep walking.
"I told you, I've got no patience for fools. Keep walking."
There's no glory in war. It's just something they tell soldiers so they'll risk their lives.
"They call me a war hero. I'm no hero, I'm just a soldier who didn't want to die."
"If Ulfric had his way, anyone who wasn't a Nord would be shipped right out of Skyrim."
"The sooner this war ends, the sooner we can all get on with our lives."
"Welcome to the House of Curiosities! I offer a brief tour for a few coins, or you can simply browse at your leisure."
"If you've got some time, stop by my House of Curiosities. I promise you'll see wonders!"
"Welcome, friend, to Calixto's House of Curiosities!"
My sister and I once traveled the world to assemble our collection. Such adventures we had!
I don't care much for the war one way or the other.
It bothers me that fewer people come to Windhelm these days.
Name's Nils. I'm the cook up at Candlehearth Hall.
"Can't just throw the big logs on the fire. Got to have the little bits, too."
"When I'm cutting wood, I pretend there's an Imperial soldier's head on the stump."
"Hello, hello, hello. Interested in fighting in the Pit? The rules are strict, but if I don't see it, it didn't happen, know what I mean?"
It's very important to Huki that all the battles are fair. What's more important to me is that my pay is fair.
"Prove your valor in the Pit! If you haven't got any valor, prove your pocketbook!"
"When Ulfric was killed, justice was done. That might sound harsh, but it's how I feel."
I thought the the Gray Quarter would be a haven for my kind. I was wrong.
"The Gray Quarter's not much to look at now, but it wasn't always so bad."
The cornerclub's been filling up at night lately. I'll bet Elda up at Candlehearth is jealous.
"We might be poor, but is it really any better out there?"
Not a day passes that I don't wonder if life would be better in Morrowind.
"I don't see why we should live as an underclass to the Nords. If anything, they owe us."
"Alchemy is simple. Unless, of course, you are simple. Then I can't help you."
Must you bother me now? I've almost figured out where it is.
"My master can be a bit short-tempered, but I've learned so much from him."
I'll never have Master Nurelion's skill with potions.
"I have a decent mind for potions, but I've also learned how to craft magical items."
I'm a sailor on the Northwind. We're laying over in Windhelm for awhile.
It's good to spend some time on solid land.
"A life on the river makes for weak legs, so I do a lot of walking when we dock."
"Captain Kjar expects the best, but he's a fair man. He never fails to reward hard work and loyalty."
Never much cared for Windhelm. The place is depressing.
I'm a lot happier out here on the deck than I am wandering around in that ruin of a city.
I heard those Forsworn out west live in caves. Can't be any worse than trying to live in Windhelm.
"Can't wait until we raise anchor. Anytime the boat's not moving, I start to get impatient."
"Sorry, but I'm not looking to hire any more crew right now."
You don't know what freedom really means until you've lived on the river.
Been on the river since I could walk. Wouldn't trade it for the world.
"While you're on my boat, you follow my rules. First rule is, don't touch anything that doesn't belong to you."
The best way for us to win the Nords' respect is through hard work.
Too many dark elves in Windhelm complain about the way we're treated. What good does complaining do?
I'm proud of my farm. It takes no small effort to grow crops in this part of Skyrim.
"I own Hollyfrost Farm outside the city. It's honest work, if a bit dull."
"The Cruel-Seas have been sailors for generations. In truth, I regret not following in the footsteps of my ancestors."
"If I make enough money from the farm, I'll buy myself a longship to sail the rivers of Skyrim."
"I understand what potions do, but I don't always understand how they do it."
"This is Stormcloak territory. If you're one of those craven Imperials, don't expect a warm welcome."
"If you're here to join the Stormcloaks, the palace is inside."
Loyal Nords are always welcome here. Anyone else better watch their step.
"If you're an Imperial spy, better turn around right now."
Stay away from the Aretino Residence. The place is cursed.
"You should unload some of that unwanted gear. Head over to Sadri's Used Wares, talk to the Elf."
"If you need an apothecary, the White Phial has respectable stock."
"By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all."
The Dunmer get their drinks at the New Gnisis Cornerclub. Why they can't just call it a tavern is beyond me...
"If it's bed or board you're after, Candlehearth Hall's got both."
"Across the river to the northeast lies Yngol Barrow. Steer clear of that foul place, lest the walking dead claim you as their own."
"The Eye of Talos was a fine ship, once. Now it lies wrecked, off an island just north of here."
"Maybe you've seen masts sticking out of the water to the northeast? That would be the wreck of the Winter War. Fine vessel, back in its day."
"South of here, and west of the road, lies Cronvangr Cave. Stay away from that cursed place, and the vampires that call it home."
"Tell me you've seen them. Those... things. Small and evil, like something out of a nightmare. They come from Stillborn Cave, to the north. I know it."
"I've no problem with your kind, Orc. But that stronghold you've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people."
I've no problem with Orcs. But that stronghold they've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
"You hear the news? There's a dragon roosting up on Mount Anthor, to the northwest."
What's this? It thinks it can just throw refuse wherever it likes?
"Really, the nerve of some people, leaving their trash wherever they please."
What kind of filthy barbarian just throws their trash on the ground?
"Oh, by all means. Just leave your refuse wherever you see fit."
"There's a place for trash, and that's not it."
"In my day, we knew how to dispose of trash properly."
What's the matter with you? You think you can just go dropping your junk wherever you like?
"Look at this one. Spoiled as a child, I'll bet. Allowed to leave trash just lying around..."
"I swear, is there no end to these uncouth savages, just throwing their trash wherever they please..."
"Hrmmm. Pick up your trash, fetcher."
And they call me a savage. Least I don't leave my trash lying around...
I never did understand the local custom of simply leaving one's trash wherever is convenient...
Who does that? Who just leaves their garbage lying about?
Gah! Quit throwing your garbage everywhere.
One person's trash is another's treasure. Don't be surprised if you find that gone...
What's he doing poking his nose in there?
What's she doing poking her nose in there?
Is he... sifting through trash?

What's he rummaging around in there for?

Tsk. What a man will do for a few coins...

You never know what you'll find laying around in a crate or barrel. People toss the darnedest things in them.

"You have done well thus far, but trying times are ahead."
It is imperative that you return to your College at once.
"You will be called on to take swift action. Rise to the challenge, and discover what you are capable of."
"You are on the right path, and you will prevail."
"So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?"
"Why, you don't think I could do it?"
Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?
"Yeah, why?"
Take down that one with your bare hands too?
Troll's blood was he a tough one!
Pfft
"But, I've got the key to the Sabre Cage! Look!"
What's that supposed to prove? Get back on patrol!
"I'm the Jarl's personal blacksmith, but that doesn't mean I can't sell you a few pieces for a fair price."
"The Empire has always been good to the Orcs, but this war of theirs is none of my concern."
I served in the Legion with Thongvor Silver-Blood. He's a good man and a tough soldier.
"I learned to forge when I was a pup, then I joined the Legion and mastered it."
Poor Banning. Twice as much work here in the stables without him.
You need a reliable horse in the Reach. That's what we have.
"You treat a horse well, it'll take you to Oblivion and back."
Traveling in the Reach is dangerous. You need a good carriage.
City of Markarth sure is a beauty. No doubt about that.
Stormcloaks took Markarth. It is good to see Talos worshipped openly again.
"What can an old skald do for you, huh?"
Songs are just old memories that help the mead go down quicker.
"I've seen every corner of Skyrim, but nothing is as beautiful as the battlefield."
My father Kleppr is the one you want to talk to. I just clean up.
My mother and father yell a lot. Always have.
"I work silver, like my father, and his father before him."
My wife Kerah runs our jewelry stall in the market.
My daughter Adara is also my apprentice. She's a quick study.
I prefer working in silver. More skill needed than forging iron or steel.
Silver-Bloods tax everything now that they run the city.
The finest jewelry in all of Markarth.
Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
"Are you looking for a gift for a friend, perhaps? Or... a lover?"
Perhaps a silver necklace or a silver ring? Easy to wear and soft against the skin.
"I have a necklace that would look lovely on you, or on a... special someone."
My daughter Adara is going to be a fine silversmith when she's older.
Jewelry for sale. Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
"You there, uh, the finest silver in Markarth is sold right here."
Maybe you could buy a gift for a friend? A best friend?
"I'm going to be a silversmith one day, like my mother and father."
Being an apprentice is great. I get to swing a hammer at things.
"Mama doesn't like me jumping up and down in the house, but I can't help it. I swear."
"Stormcloaks or Imperials. Either way, all they want is everything for free and you to lick their boots."
"Hey you. Yeah, you. Fresh meat for your stomach."
The bloodiest beef in the Reach.
You want a cut of venison or mutton? Of course you do.
Don't try to haggle with me. Buy or leave.
The secret to chopping meat is never washing your hands.
A man like me makes a lot of enemies. People are always trying to cheat me.
I paid extra for the biggest room in the Silver-Blood Inn. I need space to stretch these arms.
"I am the Jarl of Markarth, now. The Silver-Blood family is finally where it should have always been."
Igmund was weak. We'll bring the order that the Empire should have.
Let the Forsworn ravage the Reach. Talos favors us. Our victory is assured.
The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
Jarl can refuse to see me all he likes. He can't ignore us forever.
Markarth lives because my family makes sure it's fed on gold and silver.
I'm Thongvor's steward now. Every coin in this city is ours.
We'll be sending generous resources to Ulfric. As much as the Reach can bleed.
Taxes. I love taxes.
"Out of my way, kinsman."
"Out of my way, outsider."
Bother someone else.
Didn't I speak clear enough? Out of my way.
"Thongvor's made me his housecarl. Remember, me killing you is legal."
Keeping this place secure is as simple as breaking a few spines.
"Used to have run-ins with the guards, now they have run-ins with me."
Outsiders. Pfft.
"Blood and silver, friend. Blood and silver."
Just turn around and leave the city. That's the smart move.
"My family owns this inn, but I've put Kleppr in charge. Right rat for the right job, I say."
"I'm a busy man. Half this city works for my family, and I have to keep them in line."
"Thongvor may be the head of the family, but I'm the hands."
We control every piece of this city. The people should be calling us kings.
"If someone joins the Forsworn, we haul him to the mines."
Every prisoner in the Reach is just another worker for our family.
I'm married to Thonar Silver-Blood. Keep that in mind while you're speaking to me.
My husband Thonar handles all our family's business. He's an important man.
"I married Thonar for the money, and I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit it."
I'm just a servant. Don't pay me any mind.
Working in the Treasury House isn't so bad. I earn good money.
Ildene has been working in the Treasury House since before I was born.
Sometimes I hear Yngvar singing in his room. He's actually quite good.
"You just let old nana know if you need anything, all right dear?"
I've worked in the Treasury House for almost twenty years.
There isn't an inch of this building that I haven't cleaned up.
So the Stormcloaks took the Reach? Maybe Talos really is on their side.
Arnleif and Sons Trading Company buys and sells anything you wandering types need.
"No, I'm not Arnleif. Yes, I know it's called Arnleif and Sons."
"The selection seems small, but we can provide whatever you need. Just ask."
I love hearing Ogmund sing at the inn. He's a true skald.
"With Lisbet gone, I'll be taking care of you."
Let me know if there's something you need to buy.
"I'm keeping Arnleif and Sons going, as best I can."
Never thought I'd be running the store. I'm not used to it.
Lisbet handles the customers. I just check the shipments.
Feel free to take a look around the store.
I've been at Arnleif and Sons all my life. It's a good store.
I remember old Arnleif building each shelf in this store himself.
"Old Arnleif would be proud of Lisbet. She's kept this place running, thick and thin."
I brought in my cousin Cosnach to help me handle shipments.
"There's no shipments coming in, so I do nothing. Just drink."
[QUOTE]Check the shipments[QUOTE] Lisbet says. [QUOTE]There are no shipments[QUOTE] I says.
No breaks for a good worker out here.
This is the Silver-Blood Inn. I'll let you figure out who owns it by yourself.
"If I can't get you something, I'm sure my wife will bellow at me until I can."
Things are so much quieter with my darling Frabbi dead.
"Unlike my husband Kleppr, I watch after our guests."
Now you just tell me if you need something.
You come right to me if you find an unwashed floor or lumpy bed.
I'll bend Kleppr's ear if there's anything wrong with a room you rent.
Isn't my son Hreinn such a good worker? Not like his father at all....
"My worthless husband is gone, so I run the inn now."
I can't believe the mess Kleppr left things in. I have twice the work with him gone.
Don't mind the yelling. My parents are always going at each other.
I'm just here to clean up.
My father is more generous than he lets on. Gives me plenty of spending money.
The Hag's Cure is here for all your discreet needs...
"I have potions for disease, love sickness, irritating children..."
A little bit of old Reach magic can cure whatever ills you....
Oh yes... you'll need one of my special brews...
"Not scared of an old woman now, are you?"
"I've taken over the Hag's Cure, since Bothela is gone."
I'm not sure if half these potions work. But they should. I think.
I wish Bothela was still running the store. I'm not ready for this.
I'm Bothela's assistant. She's the one you should talk to if you need an herb or a potion.
There's so much to learn about the shop. I'll never get it all straight.
Why can't the men in this city leave me alone?
Alms. I said [QUOTE]alms[QUOTE] you backbiter. Give a crippled worker a helping hand.
"How about a septim? Wait, make that two septims, I feel like living it up."
"Come on, you outsiders always have plenty of gold on you. Spare a piece!"
They don't like us talking to people when we work.
Busy with the smelter.
Got metal to shape.
Just here to drink.
Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working.
"I spill just a bit of metal, and Mulush takes it out of my hide."
Can't you see I'm working? Beat it.
"Drinks here are watered down, but they're cheap."
"I oversee Markarth Smelter. Worker gets out of line, I get him back in line."
These workers. Always complaining. Always excuses.
"If a man has time to complain, he has time to work."
"Shipment of silver this month is behind. Nepos is to blame, not me."
I tell Thonar I can only smelt what Nepos and his miners dig up.
"Stormcloaks have taken the Reach, but we'll return. The Empire will bring order."
What do you want? Haven't you done enough damage to Markarth?
You speak to Igmund. Son of Hrolfdir. Jarl of Markarth.
"Treat my people fairly, and I will do the same to you."
Forsworn have troubled the Reach for too long. I intend to deal with them.
"Markarth is not without its problems, but the Empire is here to maintain order."
I can't believe we lost Markarth. Igmund's family has ruled there for generations.
"I don't think we have anything to discuss, Stormcloak."
I'm Igmund's uncle as well as his steward.
"I advise Igmund the same way I advised his father. Caution, caution, caution."
The Forsworn know every stone in the Reach. We have to wait them out.
"Igmund is alive, and I'll keep it that way, Jarl or not."
"You lay one finger on Igmund, and I'll end you Stormcloak."
"As his housecarl, Igmund's security is my chief concern."
Igmund's father was killed by Forsworn. I won't rest until they've paid with their blood.
"Raerek is far too cautious, but I'll agree with him on any measure that keeps this city safe."
Need a new blade?
Got an axe here. Good for cleaving up Forsworn.
How about some armor?
You'll want some thick armor if you're traveling the Reach alone.
Don't bother with Tacitus. Useless.
You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not Tacitus.
I run the forge now. Kind of... scary.
Making weapons and armor isn't like making nails at all.
"You need a sword? Uh, how about a small sword? Nail-sized?"
I'm Ghorza's assistant. I help her with the forge.
Ghorza is the one you should ask if you need anything.
I'm not very good for anything more than smithing nails right now.
"One time, I almost cut a finger off sharpening a blade. I hate blood."
"I have things to study, what is it?"
The artifacts I've discovered in Nchuand-Zel will make history one day.
"I've only ever lost a few guards to Steam Centurions. Good odds, considering..."
I used to travel so much before all this Forsworn nonsense. Such an inconvenience...
"Oh, excuse me. With my uncle gone, things are a bit of a mess."
"I'm not half the wizard my uncle was, but I still have a few spells worth buying."
Did you need something? A staff? Some enchanting materials?
I'm Calcelmo's nephew. I help him around the laboratory.
Don't let my uncle go on about his theories. You'll be here all night.
I'm afraid to touch half of the things we keep in the tower.
I try not to think about how my uncle got all the Dwemer Centurion parts.
"Before you say anything, no, I am not from the Reach."
I have meals to cook for the entire castle and almost no help.
The Jarl gives me two incompetent assistants. Worthless.
"I have to work, or Anton will rip my head off."
"Anton sure looks like he's from the Reach, but don't tell him that."
Only reason Jarl keeps Anton on is because he cooks up a storm.
"Don't mind the dogs, they get anxious when they haven't had dinner."
You should talk to Anton if you need anything. He's the master chef.
"It's been a hard day cleaning. Good, honest work I say."
Even the dead need company. That's what Arkay provides.
"We all come into Arkay's light in the end, but there's no need to rush."
"Markarth is a city of wealth, but gold doesn't follow you in death."
Arkay's blessing to you.
You have the honor of addressing a member of the Thalmor. Bask in it.
"The Dominion is here, and we're watching you."
The Thalmor know how to deal with Talos worshippers.
"If you see any signs of Talos worship, it's your obligation to report them to me."
The Aldmeri Dominion is the only thing keeping the Empire on its feet.
This war is such nonsense. All this fuss over their false human god.
The Warrens isn't a place for your type. What do you want?
Warrens ain't for you. Trust me.
You don't want to be here. No one wants to.
Don't know anyone here doesn't have Rattles or Ataxia.
"The Empire didn't think we could take the Reach, but here we are."
Let's see those Stormcloaks try to break into this canyon.
Outsiders aren't trusted in Markarth. Best keep that in mind.
Can't believe I'm posted here. Even the beds are made of stone.
"You should see that Orc over in Understone Keep, have him forge you some new armor..."
"By Shor, you're hauling around a lot of junk. Best stop in at the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, sell it off."
Let me guess - you need a drink. It's the Silver-Blood Inn you're looking for.
"Break the law in Markarth, and it's off to Cidhna Mine with you."
"Caught a case of Rockjoint, once. Bothela at the Hag's Cure fixed me right up."
"Lots of nasty holes in the Reach, and Blind Cliff Cave is one of them. A filthy Hagraven nest, northeast of here."
"There's an evil to the north, friend, and its name is Ragnvald. A tomb like so many in Skyrim, where the dead have found no peace."
"Travel southeast and you'll find an Orc stronghold, up around the old Dushnikh orichalcum mine."
"Beware the region northeast, across the river. Forsworn have taken refuge in Broken Tower Redoubt and Red Eagle Redoubt."
"There's a small skeever den just east of the city, at Reachwater Rock."
"The Forsworn have been spotted to the north, near Bruca's Leap Redoubt."
Need a trained war dog? Fiercest companion money can buy.
I'll be handling the horses with Cedran gone. Miss that old man.
A war dog is good company and good protection.
I like the loyalty of a dog. Not as fickle as a wolf.
You have to train a good war dog from a pup. Bite your arm clean off otherwise.
Ondolemar is the commander of the Thalmor in Markarth.
Worship of Talos is strictly forbidden.
It's all thanks to a special technique I developed. I call it the [QUOTE]Razor-Winged Butterfly.[QUOTE] I'd teach it to you... but then I'd have to kill you.
"Yeah, well, don't expect many more stories like that in my future. I'm getting old. Being that amazing takes too much damn effort."
Hmph. Been awhile since I've actually cleaved someone in two. Forgot how hard it was to get the scimitar back out.
Let that be a lesson to you young pups. There is no challenge that magic cannot overcome.
Bah! A child could have accomplished it. Such is the power of the arcane. If you only knew of the spells I didn't use. He he he he he.
"What? You think me too old, too feeble? There is more knowledge in me than in two of you pups put together. And knowledge... knowledge is my weapon."
"Once again, you have underestimated me. You see the man, brutish and hulking. But I am wolf as well. Deliberate. Cunning."
"Romantic, isn't? Like that time we first met. Remember that? Never seen so much blood. Ah, to be young again..."
"When I am become wolf, I am treachery incarnate. And then, then... there is no one who can stand between the hunter and his prey."
"When I first received the blessing of the wolf, my creator gave me a valuable piece of advice. [QUOTE]Arnbjorn,[QUOTE] he said. [QUOTE]Never lose![QUOTE] And I never do."
"He he. Don't forget that I am Shadowscale. I was, quite literally, born to kill."
"It was a simple matter, really, when one has mastered the art of camouflage. Scale becomes stone, becomes shadow. Then... death."
"My greatest challenge was deciding which weapon to use, for I am prone to indecision. Bow, dagger... axe? In the end, I opted for my claws."
"In truth? It was so easy, I feel a bit guilty. Once again, the sweet, innocent child earned more trust than was wise."
"You give me too much credit. For how could I fail? I am, after all, just a little girl. What threat could I possibly pose? He he he he he."
"I am the perfect weapon. My innocent, childish form grants me nearly unrestricted access. Poison or a good bite usually takes care of the rest."
"I am but a humble instrument of Sithis. Our Dread Father guides me. Therefore, failure is an impossibility."
"In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons - beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality. Though, a rather wet, messy formality..."
"When one can divine the future, success may not be assured... but it can at least be anticipated. It helps that I've already foretold my own death."
"Come now, dear husband. You above all people should know what I'm capable of."
"Unscrupulous daring. It's why you fell in love with me, my dear."
Sometimes I just need to remind everyone why I'm the one in charge.
"I guess I got tired of handing out contracts to everyone else, while I stayed home playing den mother. It was good to get out, and have some fun."
"I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. But more importantly, I made this Sanctuary some much needed gold. In the end, that's all that matters."
"Well, I just did what had to be done. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'm just glad I lived to tell the tale."
"Ah, contracts like that are few and far between, it seems. Makes me long for the old days..."
It's good to see a fresh face. You wouldn't have happen to come from Whiterun would you?
Generally posting information is need to know only.
I... I've been trying to find the time and place to let her know.
"I'm sorry, I can't help you."
If you want to know that bad then fine.
I'm afraid that kind of thing doesn't work on Captains in the Imperial Army.
That's the way it is.
"Yes, Sir. Although I'm not sure you'll be happy to know."
"Her daughter was sent to Whiterun, the skirmishes there have been violent. The whiterun legate, he needed to know the Stormcloak positions."
He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back.
Private Morrard... Angela's daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told.
You got Aldis to tell you something? I knew you would. What did he say?
I told her. I told her the imperial army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it.
She just wouldn't hear it.
"It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service."
"If you've come to Solitude to join the Legion, speak to Rikke. If not, just keep your nose clean while you're here... or you'll end up like Roggvir."
He's the sorry bastard who's going to be executed.
"A gate guard who let Ulfric Stormcloak escape the city, after he killed the High King."
"There's no greater honor than to serve. If you're serious about enlisting, speak to Legate Rikke in Castle Dour."
The crucial nature is pure apparent. Mundane sight traded for another sort.
"I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen..."
"It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel is so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!"
"Aye, and she's added more traps now as well... A moment of silence for our fallen friend..."
"Astrid, I've been hearing some, er... interesting things, from the others... about what you did when you left the Sanctuary last week..."
"Tell me, husband. Is it true what I've heard?"
"So, is it true?"
I heard about what happened...
"Tell me, brother. Are the stories true?"
"Tell me, sister. Are the stories true?"
Your latest exploit certainly has the Sanctuary talking...
Come now. What everyone else is saying. It can't possibly be true...
You're referring to that blacksmith contract?
You must be talking about the caravan job...
"Word certainly travels fast, doesn't it?"
"The temple contract? Well, I certainly won't deny my involvement. He he he he he."
"The Redoran contract? Yes, you heard correctly. In and out of Vvardenfell in less than forty eight hours."
"Ah, you must mean my little adventure on the ship..."
"Oh, you mean in that manor house? During the thunderstorm? Heh. What can I say? It happened, just like you heard."
But to be outnumbered twenty to one...
"You infiltrated the position, eliminated the target, and made it look like an accident. Impressive. I'd say you earned your bonus on that one!"
"To kill triplets, secretly, and then have the whole thing blamed on the mother. Remarkable."
"It was a suicide mission! Astrid said as much. Yet here you stand, hale and hearty."
"By Sithis, you slew everyone! Well, except for that one you kept alive, to serve as witness. Does your wickedness, or your skill, know no bounds?"
"But really. A horker, some twine, three wood elves, and a hatchet? Points for creativity, if nothing else."
It's the part with the severed head I find most impressive. My compliments.
I'm just trying to imagine you hiding inside the body of a mammoth. Bloody brilliant idea.
Ah! You've retrieved the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller.
Well done. You have now passed all the trials.
Come with me. It is time for us to recognize you formally as Dragonborn.
Stand in the center of the room and prepare yourself to taste the Voice of the Greybeards.
Come inside. The other masters will meet us there.
"First, Master Wulfgar will teach you the final word of Unrelenting Force. You are ready."
"Wait, so... a costume? You're not serious..."
"Sure I am. We get some furs and tree branches, paint them white, and then tie them to Stump. Instant Frostbite Spider!"
Frodnar... nobody is going to believe that your dog is a... Frostbite Spider. And if they do... they'll kill him. That's not much of a prank.
"Oh yeah, and what would you rather do?"
How about... we play tag! You're it!
"Hey, no fair! Get her, Stump!"
I'm getting out of here!
Those fools are actually fighting!
Hey! Watch what you're doing.
My money's on the big one.
Gods! Another fight.
I'm staying out of this.
Don't hurt me!
"Please, someone do something!"
Someone do something!
Somebody help!
Help!
A fight!
This should be good.
Get 'em! Kill 'em!
Ah!
Why are they hurting each other?
"Well, your bounty is low... All right, get out of my sight. But you're known to me now, scum. Remember that."
You know what? You're not worth the hassle. Go... be some other guard's problem.
"You speak to Burguk, chief of Dushnikh Yal."
"You need steel? Speak to my forge-wife, Gharol."
"Need a poison for your hunting? My mother, Murbul, knows several."
"This stronghold respects strength, and strength alone."
"Orc poisons are to be feared, if you wish to trade."
I have an old cure for Rockjoint. Common in little Orc children.
"If you wish to trade, wait for the sun to rise."
"I am Burguk's mother and wise woman to our tribe, outlander."
Malacath rewards the strong and punishes the weak.
Murbul knows many poisons and cures if you need them.
You should see Gharol if you're looking for a blade or armor.
I am the hunts-wife of this stronghold.
Burguk is a fine chief. He brings strength and wealth to the stronghold.
You wish to trade in Orc steel?
Strong gauntlets for strong hands.
Blades to kill your prey and your rivals.
We can trade when there's light outside.
I'm Burguk's forge-wife. I shape all the steel for the stronghold.
"As forge-wife, I'm also in charge of our mine."
I am Burguk's favored wife. He knows my beauty should be praised.
Arob and Gharol eye me with envy. They don't know how to please their chief.
Umurn and Nagrub will be held up as weak next to the son I will one day bear for my chief.
"I work the forge, with my mother Gharol. We mine our own ore and shape our own metal."
One day I will shape a weapon fit for a chief. Maybe that chief will be me.
I help in the mines as well as the forge.
"One day, I must fight my brother Nagrub for chiefdom. It will not be easy."
I help my mother Arob with the hunt. We bring much meat and skins to the stronghold.
Brother Umurn is a strong warrior. I look forward to fighting him for chiefdom one day.
"One day, I intend to be chief. I will fight my father and my brother for it, as is tradition."
I serve my chief and my brothers by working in the mines. It's the only place fit for an aging Orc.
"Sorry, outlander, but this old Orc cannot help you. Burguk is the chief here."
I don't know how Ghorbash has so much spirit. He should act his age.
I used to wander the corners of Skyrim like you. I miss those days.
"We honor the bravest fighters, but I have seen many types of bravery in my travels."
"I am an Orc and a warrior, but I have no desire to become chief."
"Tell me, mother, does Malacath favor our stronghold?"
He is pleased. Ours is the strongest tribe in all the Reach.
"I saw you working the forge today, wife. Your muscles have grown strong from the metal shaping!"
"Do they, my chief? Am I now favored enough to replace Shel by your side at the feast? Back your words with action!"
"No more talk of Shel. As chief, I will do what I please, so point your fiery gaze to our enemies."
"My chief, Gharol threatens to have me work in the mines. You won't allow my pretty hands to dirty, will you?"
"No, my wife. You have been given other gifts to please your chief than mine work. I will talk to Gharol and all will be well."
"Oh, thank you my chief!"
It is a fine day to work the mines.
"This metal will serve the forge well, my brother."
"You could challenge Burguk, my brother. Yours is the stronger swordarm."
Serving in the Legion taught me to respect leadership. The stronghold needs Burguk.
The air has the smell of beasts. The hunt is good today.
"Yes, mother. I'm eager to prove my skills today."
"Ah, the air is good today. I welcome the smell of blood from all the kills I will make."
"Patience, my son. The hunter days not welcome the blood of his prey, he waits for it."
"You are speaking to Larak, chief of Mor Khazgur."
"You should see my forge-wife, Shuftharz, if you need weapons or armor."
"My mother, Sharamph, knows many remedies you may wish to take with you."
"I'm a strict follower of the old traditions. Honor, strength, deeds."
My place is chief and my challenge is to lead my people.
"I have poisons for your weapons, and cures for your ills."
Poisons can kill your enemies faster than any blade.
Do not allow Ataxia to fester. A smart warrior keeps a potion to cure diseases at all times.
"If you wish to trade, see me during daylight."
I am wise woman to this stronghold.
Our chief is strong. That is all that matters.
"You should see my mother, Sharamph, if you need a cure or a poison."
"Shuftharz can forge you some armor, outlander."
Malacath protect you.
"Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief."
"You need some armor, outlander?"
How about an axe? Malacath smiles on the axe-wielder.
"We can trade in the morning, outlander."
"The forge is strong and so is our chief, Larak. I'm content."
"My son, Olur, learns the forge well. His work brings me pride."
"I envy you, outlander. You can choose to leave if you wish."
"Soon, I will be of age. The taste is bitter."
"Perhaps I'll join the Legion one day, as my father had done."
I work in the forge and the mines. Mother says it pleases her and our people.
Even good hammers warp metal if struck without care.
Mother tells me to shape metal with focus and strength.
"Malacath is pleased with your strength, Larak."
I am honored.
The way you and your mother forge weapons is impressive.
"It's simple Orc smithing practice, my chief. Nothing that hasn't been passed down for years."
"Thank you, my chief."
Your muscles ripple when you work the forge. It's pleasing.
"Damn shame, Roggvir. You were a good man."
That makes Twenty-Three.
Talos protect you.
Roggvir. You damn fool.
I'm going to find whoever did this.
Kynareth preserve us.
Better this one than me.
Agh! Dead body!
Poor bastard's better off.
What a waste.
Another corpse for the pile.
Such a shame.
Damn shame.
Dead? Oh my goodness!
Shouldn't leave things around to trip over...
"Oh my word, this is terrible."
Agh! Who did this?
Another poor soul lost.
Dead? How did this happen?
Oh... what happened?
Dragonborn!
"Shor's blood, the Thu'um!"
Are you Dragonborn?
"By the gods, is that the Voice?"
Wow!
That must be the Voice!
What in Arkay's name was that?
That sound... it's deafening!
Could that be... the Voice?
Those words have such power!
What sort of power was that?
That was amazing!
The Voice? Here?
That sound could bring mountains down!
You have a mighty voice!
That voice is power!
"Louder than the roar of the Mane, that is!"
S'rendarr's mercy!
Are you a Greybeard?
Did anyone else hear that?
"By the gods, my ears..."
That gave me the shivers!
Now that's a real man!
"Oh gods, my ears!"
Not so loud!
I haven't heard a true shout in generations!
Now that's the true Voice!
How did you do that?
What was that?
Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?
Give me a reason to try.
"[QUOTE]To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies.[QUOTE]"
It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.
You always were a quick study.
"Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive."
Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.
Did you forget the Oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?
Enough of this mindless banter!
"I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence."
"But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing."
"You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired."
How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself.
"Karliah has provided me with the means to be rid of you, and this ancient tomb becomes your final resting place."
But do you know what intrigues me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you.
Shhh. Listen to Enthir... we can't afford to miss a single detail.
"We haven't much time for discussion, but what did you need?"
Let's listen to Enthir's translation before we decide what we do.
"Please, there isn't much time. What is it?"
"Please, make it brief. We have much to do."
"Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?"
Was there something else?
"Yes, yes. What is it?"
Can I help you with anything else?
"Ah yes, my matchmaker. What is it I can do for you?"
"Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important."
"I've already provided you with the key to my museum, what else could you possibly want?"
What is it this time?
This better be important.
Karliah? Then she's finally found it.
Do you have Gallus's Journal?
A problem? Let me see it.
"This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but always too clever for his own good."
He's written all of the text in the Falmer language.
"No. However, I know someone who might."
"The court wizard of Markarth, Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal translated."
A word of warning. Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his research. Getting the information won't be easy.
Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of completing my magnum opus on the subject.
I'm calling it [QUOTE]Calcelmo's Guide to the Falmer Tongue.[QUOTE] It will revolutionize the way we understand those ancient beings.
Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim!
You must be mad to think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.
"I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with, but I can assure you that personal wealth is our lowest priority."
By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of the Jarl.
Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little rebellion of theirs once and for all.
We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
The rebels have agreed to cease hostilities until we hash out this treaty. Suffice it to say I'm not holding my breath.
For the moment we have ceased hostilities. We'll see what these Imperials have to say. I doubt we'll come to any lasting agreement.
"Things are quiet for the moment. That won't last long. As soon as a new campaign starts, I want you there. Stay close. See me tomorrow."
The gods have granted us peace for the moment. But that won't last long. I'm sure trouble will be stirred up soon enough.
Of course. But why not let him go in first?
Of course. But why not let her go in first?
"They may be cowards, but I'm not. I'll go with you."
Lead on.
I suppose you're right. I'm not a fighting man.
"Go, and avenge my Laelette for me."
So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about.
"Close the door, then we can talk."
Not here. Follow me.
The Greybeards seem to think you're the Dragonborn. I hope they're right.
Surprised? I guess I'm getting pretty good at my harmless innkeeper act.
You can't be too careful. Thalmor spies are everywhere.
It was the only way I could make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
You ready to hear me out?
I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me out.
"I'm part of a group that's been looking for you... well, someone like you, for a very long time."
"If you really are Dragonborn, that is. Before I tell you any more, I need to make sure I can trust you."
"Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial near there. If we can get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it."
That was well done. Come on. I've been wanting a closer look at one of these buggers.
Come on. Let's go see if there's a mythical dragon buried up there.
We need to find the burial mound. Let's ask in the inn.
"I... it's true, isn't it? You really are Dragonborn."
So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover the dragonstone for me.
"It's what I do. I make things happen from behind the scenes. After all, here you are."
"I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I guess even my paranoia has its limits."
You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.
We remember what most don't - that the Dragonborn is the ultimate dragonslayer.
You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently by devouring its soul.
The dragonstone was a map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
"It seems to be spreading from the southeast, down in the Jeralls near Riften. The one at Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds."
I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
"You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for Farengar, remember?"
Slen Tiid Vo!
There's no time to waste. Let's go.
"Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn."
"I'll explain what I want when I want, got it? You'd already be dead if I didn't like the look of you when you walked in here."
But I had to know if the rumors about you were true...
"If you don't trust me, you were a fool to walk in here in the first place."
"Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life."
"They weren't gone somewhere for all these years. They were dead, killed off centuries ago by my predecessors."
Now something's happening to bring them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
I know they are. I've visited their ancient burial mounds and found them empty.
And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life.
"We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know."
"You'll be back. If you're really Dragonborn, this is your destiny."
Let's get going.
Come on. We've got to get to Kynesgrove.
We'd better keep moving.
"Ha. A few years ago, I said almost the same thing to a colleague of mine. Well, it turned out he was right and I was wrong."
"That mound you remembered sounds like what we're looking for. East of Kynesgrove, right?"
I don't know exactly. We need to find the ancient burial mound. Let's ask around town.
I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we had a heart like yours among our numbers.
That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not befit warriors like us.
You are due more honor than some calls and feasting.
We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away this great gift we've been granted.
He thinks we've been cursed. But we've been blessed. How can something that gives this kind of prowess be a curse?
So we take matters into our own hands.
"He was one of the strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come without a Shield-Brother."
"Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from the bodies."
You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at our sight.
"There's a pack of werewolf hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock."
The Silver Hand. I think you've met them before.
We're going to slaughter them. All of them.
Lead on. Skjor's already scouting ahead.
"To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the shared blood of the wolf."
"I was hoping you'd change your mind. Come on. I'm heading to Riverwood, just up the road. My sister Gerdur will help us out."
"All right. If I make it back to Windhelm, I'll make sure Ulfric knows how you helped me."
"Skyrim needs people like you, if we ever hope to regain our freedom from the damned Empire. Good luck."
Keep an eye out for Imperials. They still hold this entire region. As long as we don't do anything stupid... we should be all right.
"Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus."
"He's the world's master of the nature of Elder Scrolls, but... well."
He's been gone for a long while. Too long.
Come closer. Bask in my presence.
"I am Hermaeus Mora. I am the guardian of the unseen, and knower of the unknown. I have been watching you, mortal."
Most impressive.
"Your continuing aid to Septimus renders him increasingly obsolete. He has served me well, but his time is nearing its end."
"Once that infernal lockbox is opened, he will have exhausted his usefulness to me."
"When that time comes, you shall take his place as my emissary. What say you?"
"Indeed. Speak with me when the box has been opened, and all shall be revealed."
Be warned. Many have thought as you do. I have broken them all. You shall not evade me forever.
"Go forth. Do the biddings of Septimus, for he is working my will in your plane."
What is this... it's... it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond burns in my mind. It's marvelous....
"Come, my champion."
"Now you have my Oghma Infinium. It contains the knowledge of the ages as revealed to Xarses, my loyal servant."
For hundreds of years it's been shut away from the world. Septimus was a useful tool for unleashing it.
Now it is in your hands. Let us work wonders together...
"Eirid and I are playing Hunt the Elf. It's my job to find the Elf, and kill it dead."
Have you seen it?
Thanks!
Thanks!
All right!
"Fine, Elf-Lover. I'll find her myself."
I'll find that Elf. I always do.
"I'm gonna find you, Elf!"
Ha! Found you!
I hate this game.
That's because you always lose... Elf.
I understand Eirid's been playing [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] again.
"It's just children playing, Haran. I wouldn't fret over it."
I'm not [QUOTE]fretting.[QUOTE] I don't want Eirid playing those sorts of games!
"All right, all right. I'll speak to her."
I understand Korir's been complaining about our customers again.
"What of it? It's our Inn, and they cause him no harm."
I believe he was suggesting their presence causes him harm.
"Well, then he's welcome to eat and drink at home, isn't he?"
"Well, isn't this a surprise!"
"How much of our money have you spent today, Ranmir? Anything left, or is it all gone?"
"If I wanted to get yelled at, I'd be home. Can't you leave me be?"
"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? Am I making your life more difficult?"
"Please, come home. Just... Just come home."
Can't. Got at least two rounds to go.
Why don't you go... sell something.
Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death.
"Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway."
"Is everything well, Nelacar?"
"Oh yes, quite fine. My accommodations here continue to be just what I need."
And there haven't been any... problems?
"Are you referring to your other customers? No, everything is quite all right. I expect a bit of animosity now and then."
"I see. Well, let me know if things get out of hand."
"I say, you didn't hear any loud noises last night, did you? No, ahh... explosion sounds?"
"No, I certainly didn't!"
Is there a reason you're asking me?
"No, certainly not. A small experiment may have gone awry, but clearly with no discernable consequences."
I... see. And is this something I'll need to worry about in the future?
"Oh, certainly I hope not! That would be quite unfortunate for my research."
"Yes, yes, so you said. But so what? The end is upon us. I may as well die here as anywhere else. I'm tired of running."
"Important? Far more than even she realizes! If you are Dragonborn, then..."
"Oh, yes. It's all been foretold. The end has begun. Alduin has returned."
Only a Dragonborn can stop him. But no Dragonborn has been known for centuries.
"It seems that the gods have grown tired of us. They've left us to our fate, as the plaything of Alduin the World-Eater."
"But, give me... just a moment... I must gather a few things..."
Are we running low on mead?
No. Even Ranmir can only drink so much.
"No, without Ranmir around we're running out of stock far less often than we used to."
Let's just keep an eye on the supply. It's such a chore to restock.
I suppose that's a benefit to having so few customers.
How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?
"As long as he keeps paying, I suppose. He keeps to himself, and isn't hurting anyone."
Are you so sure of that? I think Birna might disagree with you.
"It's not my place to get involved in their family's business, remember? You're the one that told me to stay out of it."
"Good morning, Assur. What do you want to do today?"
We're playing Hunt the Elf. You're the Elf.
Why do I always have to be the Elf? I don't want to!
"Too bad. That's what we're playing, and you're the Elf. Now go hide so I can hunt you!"
Fine.
"I know, I know. I'm hurrying."
"Yes, I'll be ready in a moment, I just need one more thing..."
"Fine! I'll just... leave the rest of it. Let's go, then, if you're in such a hurry."
"Come in, come in. Mustn't speak of these things in the Ratway."
You... Dragonborn? Is it really true?
"So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years."
"I thought she'd have realized it's hopeless by now. I tried to tell her, years ago..."
"Divines sake, Skald. Who do think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers, anymore."
"So you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little Family. I've heard quite a bit about you."
Stop. Turn around. And go back the way you came. Astrid is waiting for you. She's down near the entrance. You must have passed right by her.
"You work hard, Daighre. Glad you have stayed with us."
"I'm grateful, Skaggi. I'm sorry my daughter gives you so much trouble."
Skaggi tells me that you were bothering him today. Can't you and Torom just play by yourselves?
"But mom, it's so boring with just me and Torom. I was just asking Skaggi some questions."
You leave him alone. I don't want to hear Skaggi telling me you've been bothering him again!
"Yes, ma'am."
"Mining out this old rock is a lot quieter, now. Thank the Divines."
Hard to believe there'd be an old crypt underneath the mine.
We're getting back to work as best we can.
It's crazy to still be working here. What if there's more draugr down there?
This mine will be our grave yet. I just know it.
Any day now more draugr are going to come out of that crypt.
We tunneled into an old crypt. We're warning strangers to keep out.
I'm not going into the mine with draugr lurking down there.
Guards are useless. They just stand around waiting for a full regiment to come and help.
We're keeping the mine closed until that crypt is clear.
I hear talk about a regiment coming to clear the crypt out. We'll see if that happens.
There's still plenty of ore left in that mine. What a waste.
Mine's closed. Move along.
This is the last hagraven between us and my mother!
"Greetings, mother."
Daughter. Who is this you have brought me?
"I found a willing subject for you. Payment has already been discussed, of course."
"Splendid! Please take a seat on the chair behind me, would you?"
I'll just prepare the subject now...
"I can't let you do this, mother. You have to die now!"
"I'm still busy, but I can always make time to speak with you."
Always a pleasure. What brings you back?
Any luck locating those jazbay grapes?
"Ah, you're back."
I hope this is important... I get little sleep as it is.
"I'm a bit busy at the moment, what did you want?"
"I have a lot to do around the farm, so make it quick please. What is it you wanted?"
I don't suppose you could come back another time? I'm very busy.
This place is boring. Nothing but the same thing every day. Sigh.
I wish I could head to one of the capital cities... maybe even back to Mournhold. Anywhere but here.
"One day I hope to become a painter, but at this rate it looks like it's never going to happen."
Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to set what you see on a canvas so you'd have that memory forever?
"My sister keeps telling me that the farm keeps us alive, but I don't really call this living."
"Aduri, how come the fields haven't been tilled like I asked?"
Because it's boring. The fields are going to do fine... you don't have to dote over them so much.
"Boring? That food is paying for everything. If we lose even a single crop, we could starve or be forced to beg. I won't have it!"
"All right, I understand. I'll do it tomorrow, okay? Just get off my back."
Have you decided if I can head up to Solitude yet? I hear it's the best place to meet someone who may be willing to teach me to paint.
"I'm sorry, Aduri, not this year. Perhaps next year after the harvest, I don't know. There's so much to do."
"It's not going to be next year, nor the year after that! You just care about this farm more than you care about me!"
"Painting won't put food on the table, but our crops will. Be patient Aduri... it will happen someday, I promise."
Thanks for the help. Not many willing to take on the Forsworn these days.
"Stand next to me, and prepare your Whirlwind Sprint. Master Borri will give the signal."
Follow me. Master Borri will test your Whirlwind Sprint.
We will do your next test in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
Master Borri will teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
Master Einarth is waiting.
You must feel the Word within yourself.
"You learn quickly, as only a Dragonborn can."
Master Borri is waiting.
Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice. Dragons also are able to absorb the power of their slain brethren.
A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries.
What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us years to achieve.
"Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later, when you are ready."
"Your quick mastery of a new Thu'um is... astonishing. I'd heard the stories of the abilities of Dragonborn, but to see it for myself..."
No. Indeed not. But beware that your skill does not outstrip your wisdom.
Despite what you discovered it's still comforting to know my husband is at peace.
"So, any luck finding my louse of a husband?"
Hmph. If you see my good-for-nothing husband Leifnarr on your journeys tell him he's no longer welcome here.
Men are utter pigs... they only care about one thing.
You men are utter pigs... you only care about one thing.
"Men are complete pigs, am I right? All they care about is one thing... and you know exactly what I mean."
"If I ever catch my husband in bed with another woman, he's going to find himself homeless."
I can't believe my mother's gone. Now what'll I do?
I knew it! I knew my father was a hero and he didn't just run away.
It's just me and my mother at the mill here. My father is gone. We don't know what happened to him.
I hope you're not here to start some trouble. I'll fight you if I have to.
"My mother taught me the millwork trade... you know, which trees to cut and which ones to pass up."
Someday I'll take over the mill... when I'm old enough.
I'm not afraid of anyone. Put a sword in my hand and I could defend this place if I had to!
"Millwork sure is boring, but at least I don't have to work in a nasty mine."
Gralnach! I told you not to go through your father's things!
"I'm sorry mother, now that he's dead, I just want to know everything I can about him."
"I'm sorry mother, I just want to know more about him. You never tell me anything!"
"He was a wonderful man, and he loved us very much. I'm sorry I yelled at you."
That's because there's nothing to tell. He left us to fend for ourselves and that's all you need to know.
"It's okay, mother. I understand."
I wish you didn't hate him so much... I wish the whole family could be together again.
"Mother, I finished cutting at the northern stand. Where do I move on to now?"
There is a copse of elms to the east. We could really use that wood.
"I was hoping to head into Riften for supplies, but I can do that after I'm done with the elms."
"Just be careful, Gralnach. That copse doesn't look safe. If you see any trouble, you run right home."
Thanks again for getting my bow back from those thieves. Next time they come knocking I'll be ready.
"So, has my bow turned up yet?"
Who in the name of Azura are you?
You look suspicious. You better not be one of those damn thieves.
It's not safe around here. There's thieves out there looking to steal everything you own.
You even think of taking something from my house... and I'll kill you.
"Now that you've brought Dravin's bow back, he's back to his crabby old self. For better or for worse, I still thank you."
"After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place."
You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.
The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.
"Someday, I hope we can get away from here... perhaps move back to Morrowind. This isn't at all what we expected."
I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.
"Synda... you left your dagger behind again yesterday. I told you, the road isn't safe."
"Husband, you worry far too much. We are within an hour's walk of Riften."
That doesn't matter. All it would take is a stray wolf or a bandit crossing your path... I can't bare to lose you after everything we've done.
"If it puts your mind at ease, I'll take it with me. I'm sorry."
Dravin! One of the soldiers I spoke to on the way home said you threatened them. What's come over you?
"I can't stand them, they represent everything I hate about Skyrim. They're tearing the place apart!"
All you'll accomplish by threatening them is ending up in the Riften dungeon. You're lucky they didn't take you seriously.
"Sorry, Marise. I just can't sit back and watch them treat us like a resource. This is our home!"
I don't care! Just stay away from the soldiers and keep to your business. It's the only way we'll make it through this.
"Maybe we could invite some of those nice guards over. You know, for some supper?"
"No. I have enough trouble without more mouths to feed! They're the Jarl's men, they can eat supper at the keep."
Terrible. Only a matter of time before soldiers come and burn all my hard work into dust!
"How do you think the crops are coming, dear?"
Look at the sky. Be a terrible day tomorrow. I know it.
"Oh, Rogatus! Maybe tomorrow will be pleasant for once, hmm? It can't be terrible every day!"
"Yes it can. I haven't been wrong in 50 years, and I won't be wrong tomorrow."
"Are you all right, Gat?"
"Still shaken from all the fighting, my friend. It's been too long since I had to kill someone."
I try to think of it as coaxing the ore from the rock.
I keep hearing stories about Morrowind. Sounds like a wretched place.
I hear there's baked slaughterfish tonight.
Is there something I can help you with?
What's your trouble? Dasturn telling tales again?
We keep hearing that the war could come through here. I try not to worry about it.
"It's tough to keep track of Hrefna. If her father wasn't such a snowback, he'd be around to help out."
"I'm not proud of Hrefna's father. If she knew him, she wouldn't be either."
Hi! I've never seen you around here before. Are you a miner too?
Sondas takes care of me when mom's not around.
Derkeethus used to take me diving way down deep in the river. I miss him.
"Mom says the Empire is mean, but I don't think they're that bad."
"The Stormcloaks are named after Ulfric. He's a bad man, but don't tell the soldiers that."
A traveler? I'll be you've seen some sights. We should swap tales sometime.
There's a gorgeous tree that grows right up through a cave to the northeast of here.
"If you're heading to Kynesgrove, stick to the road. Some pretty dangerous caves between here and there."
Verner used to love exploring before we got married. Now he's become a bit of a milk drinker. Likes to stay home.
"If you head straight west from where the White River splits towards Whiterun, you can get a look at the Cradlecrush giants."
You looking for work? We could use an extra hand in the mine. Just bring me any Corundum you dig up.
"Annekke used to help more with the mining, but nowadays she's a bit of a bounder."
I do love my wife. Just wish she'd get her head out of the clouds.
"If you want some information about the area, Annekke knows it better than anyone."
Sometimes I feel like Annekke cares more about finding new rocks than being with me.
Did you see the fires from Goldenglow Estate? I was afraid the whole place was going to burn to the ground!
"If you're looking to purchase goods, I have none to sell. You should head into Riften instead."
Pretty quiet out here on the farm. My wife and I kind of like the solitude.
Vulwulf has been quite generous to let me take care of their farm considering I am not part of their family.
The Snow-Shod's are very trusting to let me run this place without their supervision.
I'm glad there are guards outside the farm. I don't think I could defend the place alone.
My husband and I were just recently married.
"I'm originally from Cyrodiil, but I left there after I had a falling out with my family."
"This was the first door in Skyrim I knocked upon, and little did I know my future husband would be answering the door."
I like the farm life. It's a huge change from living in a city.
Addvild's made me a happy woman. I wouldn't want to be with anyone else in the world.
"Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise, Dragonborn."
"You show promise. Remain focused, and you will fulfill your potential."
"You have the ability, but you need to learn discpline if you wish to fulfill your potential."
We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Word.
Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.
Try it again. Breath and focus.
Is this your best effort? Again.
"Come, Dragonborn. Attend to Master Borri."
"So... a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age."
You are now ready for your last trial.
"Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of Ustengrav."
"Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return."
"Masters Einarth, Borri, and Wulfgar will each demonstrate a Shout. Make your choice."
"Don't worry, though. You will find all three Words in Ustengrav."
Strike the targets as they appear. Breath and focus.
Master Borri has agreed to teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
"Use both words, if you can."
"Use both Fus and Ro. Together, they will make the Shout more powerful."
Well done. Again.
You learn quickly. Once more.
That's it. One more time.
Bex!
"Come, we will do your next test inside the hall."
"Without training, you have already taken the first steps towards projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a Shout."
Now let us see if you are willing and able to learn.
"Master Einarth will now teach you [QUOTE]Ro,[QUOTE] the second Word in Unrelenting Force."
"First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice."
But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?
"You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper."
Understood... husband?
"Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil."
"Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition."
"Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor."
But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?
"Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss."
"Oh yes, mistress. You're the [QUOTE]boss.[QUOTE] For now."
We will see if you truly have the gift.
"Show us, Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice."
"Everything well, Jesper?"
"Yes sir, fine sir."
"Good, good. Keep up the hard work. It'll all pay off."
"Is everything well with you, my scaly friend?"
"Teeba-Ei is cold, but Teeba-Ei works hard as always."
"Yes, well... That's all we ask of you. Carry on."
Yes sir.
"How goes it, son?"
"I'm fine, father. Work is fine."
"Good, good. It's honest work, son. No shame in that."
Of course not. I never thought otherwise.
"Right. Well, you let me know if you need anything."
I'm going to Movarth's Lair to kill that monster. Are you with me?
Take us to Movarth's Lair!
Yes!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Take us!
Kill the vampire!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Let's kill him!
Destroy him!
I want vengeance for my wife!
Vengeance for Laelette!
We're marching on Movarth's Lair whether you come with us or not.
Um...this place looks dangerous.
Yeah. Kind of scary too.
And it's full of vampires?
Morthal is full of cowards! Let's go kill that monster.
Cowards! We must kill the vampires. We have to make them pay!
"Let's make sure we're just as productive this month as we were last. If Bryling's happy, we're happy."
"Yes sir, of course."
All right. Keep up the good work.
I just don't understand what kind of a man does that.
I am Master Arngeir. I speak for the Greybeards.
"Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come here?"
"Shout for us, Dragonborn. Then we may have time for questions."
"Oh, what is this? A visitor? To our farm? Oh, do stay for a while, dear."
"Now, you don't let Rogatus cause you any bother."
My husband just gets cranky when he doesn't get enough sleep.
Our son Leontius moved to Old Hroldan nearly 30 years ago. I still miss him.
"I hope my son has found some nice, well-mannered girl to settle down with."
Rogatus and I have been married over 50 years. He's always been a bit of a grouch.
My boy Leontius lives in Old Hroldan. Damn drunk.
"I've lived through rebellion, Forsworn, undead, witches, wizards, hagravens, and marriage."
Next thing you know there will be some kind of damn blight and undead will walk the land.
You ever have to farm land while there was a battle going on? I have.
Damn soldiers always trample my crops.
I'm been farming this bit of land all my life.
"Oh, wipe that frown off your face Rogatus. You've been wearing that frown for over 50 years now."
You want me to smile? What's there to smile about? Soldiers and dragons are going to be trampling all over the crops this year. I just know it.
"Oh, stop being such a grouch! Not every visitor to the farm wants to burn it down! Maybe they just want to have a nice supper with us, hmm?"
"You don't invite monsters into your home to have supper! I won't have them here, and I'm certainly not smiling for them!"
"Damn Forsworn. Only a matter of time before they hit here, too."
Guess we'll have two more mouths to feed for a while.
Don't have much to say unless you're here to mine metal.
"I'm in charge of Left Hand Mine. You cause trouble, you answer to me."
"Left Hand Mine deals with iron, the perfect metal to dig with a war going on."
"Kolskeggr, overrun with Forsworn, what next?"
Did you hear that? Pavo was driven out of his mine. Almost everyone is dead.
What if the Forsworn come here? We aren't safe.
You should speak with my husband. Skaggi runs everything.
I'm just here to mine.
Got ore to dig.
I'm one of miners. Plenty of ore to dig up around here.
Don't have much to say to you. Got work.
"It's amazing how much work goes into the little things, isn't it?"
I'm just here to dig. Not much else to talk about.
"Kolskeggr Mine is lost, friend. Forsworn killed everyone."
Don't go to Kolskeggr. It's not safe.
Gat and I are the only survivors.
Pavo and I had to fight our way out of Kolskeggr. Forsworn killed everyone else.
Thank Malacath we got out of Kolskeggr alive.
Don't know what I would have done without Pavo. Man's braver than he admits.
Poor Pavo and Gat. To have lived through a Forsworn attack.
"Another day, another settlement gets attacked. No place in the Reach is safe from the Forsworn."
I'm the hardest worker in Left Hand. Better than any man.
"Most women would rather die than dig, but I have a daughter to raise."
My Erith has her father's eyes. She's all I have left of him.
"Why is everyone so upset? If there's Forsworn, the Jarl will take care of them, right?"
Hope Pavo will be able to go back to his mine soon. Everyone needs a home.
"What'cha doing in Left Hand? Do you dig up rocks too, like my mom?"
Why do they call it Left Hand Mine? Can the miners use their right hands too?
Have you met Torom? He's the best dog in the Reach.
"By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!"
Now maybe we can put all this behind us.
Take this as a token of our gratitude.
"By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!"
Now maybe we can put all this behind us.
Take this as a token of our gratitude.
"The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality."
But he willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the vagaries of life and death.
"It is through the ebb and flow of this cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace."
May the spirit of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know the beloved serenity of Aetherius...
... and may we one day rejoin them in eternity.
Do you not know the Daedric Lord of the Hunt?
"He revels in the chase, and also gave the [QUOTE]gift[QUOTE] of lycanthropy to mortals."
"A powerful force, not to be crossed. As I learned too late."
"With those three vessels, Hevnoraak can restore himself. Find them before he can."
"Kill him now, while we still can!"
Did you find all of the vessels?
Do not interrupt the ritual. Go empty the vessels and sit on the throne.
Hevnoraak is defeated.
"Thank you, hero. Now I may finally rest. Take Hevnoraak's iron mask. It may be of use to you, and serve as some reward for your feat here."
"Boy, did you miss all the excitement."
There's too much of an obsession these days with knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well-placed spell.
You like creepin' around in the shadows? Magic'll work just as good there as anywhere else.
Nobody ever expects a fireball from the darkened corner.
Talk to Babette about potions. She's the creepy little girl - can't miss her.
"Yes, yes. I'm your brother and I'm supposed to greet you respectfully. So [QUOTE]hello.[QUOTE] There, satisfied?"
I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.
Don't let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older. Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl.
"It's been quite a boon, looking like a child. No one ever suspects a thing."
My targets make the mistake of not perceiving me as a threat. Last mistake they ever make.
I could brew some potions for you. Or train you in Alchemy.
You looking to buy some potions? Or maybe I could help train you to make your own?
Let me guess - Astrid failed to mention I'm her husband? She has a tendency to do that. Doesn't want the others thinking she plays favorites.
"What do you want, beef roast?"
"You're part of a family now, hamshank. I trust you... you trust me. Got it?"
"Don't take offense to the nicknames, morsel. I'm a werewolf. Hard not to think of you as a snack."
"Hello, tidbit."
"It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects."
"Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am, therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a being's inevitable end."
"In the Dark Brotherhood, I found acceptance, love, and my life's true purpose."
"Death is but the time to sleep forever, in the Void."
"Sithis' whisper be upon you, brother."
"Sithis' whisper be upon you, sister."
It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Owww...
"Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?"
"Me, I have been part of the Dark Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am a Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow."
"I serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary. Life is simple, and good."
"The Shadowscales are all but forgotten. An ancient tradition, from another time."
"Greetings, brother."
"Greetings, sister."
"Oh, hello hello!"
You require the services of the Fool of Hearts?
"Greetings, Listener!"
How may I serve the Listener?
Brother.
Sister.
Need something?
"If you bring mead, you're welcome here! Even if you don't, you're still welcome!"
All this talk of dragons is making people antsy. Nonsense!
"I visited the meaderies of Riften once, as a lad. Wish I had their skill."
"Working our mine is dangerous work, but Dravynea keeps it going. Well, Dravynea and the promise of more mead."
You've got a fine look about you. Come have a visit at the Braidwood Inn. Better than home!
"Welcome to Kynesgrove. If you want to do business here, you'll have to deal with me."
"If it's malachite you're after, you've come to the right place. I'll pay for any you dig up out of Steamscorch Mine."
Kjeld speaks for Kynesgrove. Anyone who says otherwise is aching for a fight.
Roggi and I do the work around here. My wife and brats just sit around on their brains wasting time.
"My wife is a good woman, but every man needs a little variety, you know?"
An outsider? No reason to stop in Kynesgrove. Keep moving.
The mine's always on the verge of collapse. Good thing I'm around to keep it up.
"Morrowind used to be a lovely place, but you couldn't pay me to live there these days."
Most people in Skyrim don't care for Dunmer. Roggi's the only one around here even half-decent.
I should get over to Windhelm more. See how the other Morrowind refugees are getting along.
"Seen the remnants of the grove? That... well, that was me. Me and my sister."
Came here to start a lumber mill. Who knew the Nords cared about a bunch of old trees?
"But... well, they did. Sacred, they said. So we work the mines until we've worked it off. Fair enough, I guess."
"Oh, great, another wanderer. Slumming it on your way to Windhelm?"
Wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my idiot sister.
I can't believe she dragged me all the way to this snowball. I'd rather be broke in Cyrodiil than broke here.
"If these Nords don't let up soon, I might just make a break for it. At least Cyrodiil is warmer than this."
Did you see my husband already? I'm sorry... he can come off a bit rough at times.
I hope you'll stay for a bit. We could certainly use the business.
This is really quite a nice town when you get down to it. Just look at the view!
"Got some nice comfy beds at the Braidwood Inn, if you're looking to flop down somewhere."
I've never seen you before. Leave me alone!
"My pa runs this town, and you're going to be in big trouble if you mess with me."
You don't look so tough. I'll bet I could take you.
Why are you still here?
Yamarz was a fool. Always trying to scheme his way out of responsibility.
"Well, the giants took care of him, and you took care of the giants. Two problems solved at once."
"But, you took care of him and the giants. Two problems solved at once."
"Now, take Shagrol's hammer back to Largashbur, and we'll see about whipping the rest of them into shape."
"The Old Hroldan Inn is still open, bless poor Eydis's memory."
"Skuli owns the inn with his mother gone, but I handle the rooms."
You should head on inside. Eydis or Skuli can take care of you.
I work for Eydis. She runs the inn.
You'll be looking to rent Tiber Septim's room I take it?
Old Hroldan is the stone that the Empire's history is built on.
"Don't underestimate my son, Skuli. He may look young, but he can handle any drunks we get."
Skuli's father is off fighting for the Empire. I'm sure he's just fine.
Skuli's father is off fighting for the Stormcloaks. I'm sure he's just fine.
This is the Old Hroldan Inn. Clean beds and strong drink.
"My mother's dead, but I won't close the inn. I've hired Leontius to run things."
"If you drink too much, you're out. No drunks."
Changed the linens myself. They're fresh.
Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.
I guess we'd better try this way.
Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.
You dare challenge me?
I cannot be defeated!
My power is supreme!
"Come on, show an old man what you got!"
I'll cut out your eyes and sell 'em for coin!
You're nothing but a joke!
Don't make me laugh!
My blade thirsts for your blood!
Come on. Show me you've got what it takes!
You just made the last mistake of your life!
I'll spit on your corpse!
I've killed legions like you!
Is that the best you can do?
I claim your soul for Nocturnal!
The shadows will be your undoing!
Your death will be swift!
"I'm having fun, are you?"
Call yourself a warrior?
You're losing a lot of blood. Maybe you should sit down for a moment.
Come on! I dare you!
"Come on, at least try to hurt me."
Die Imperial!
Where's your precious Emperor now?
You call this a fight?
Wake me up when you're ready to fight me for real.
You want me to close my eyes? Would that even things up a little?
Hahahaha!
Getting tired yet?
"Die, will you?!"
I've seen fresh recruits with more skill than you!
I'm not impressed.
I have no problem killing you. How do you feel about dying?
Ready to give up?
Hahahaha!
I'll enjoy killing you!
Now you're just making me mad.
Your blood is such a pretty shade of red!
The Emperor can kiss my ass!
Damn you!
I eat Legionnaires like you for breakfast!
I got something for you. But you'll have to come and get it.
I'm getting bored.
Are you trying? 'Cause I'm not.
Die damnit!
"Come on, you're not even trying!"
Let me make this plain and simple. No more jobs until you pay Vex. No get to it.
Aren't you supposed to be in Markarth? Finish that job and we'll talk about more.
"Slow down, you have that special request in Windhelm to finish first. After that's done, I'll send you some more jobs."
"Before I'm goin' to give you any more work, you need to finish that job in Solitude."
I want you to finish that job in Whiterun first. Then we'll talk about more work.
"I handle the fishin', numbers and bedlam jobs... the ones with the more personal touch."
"If break-ins are more your thing, go talk to Vex."
"Good, my clients are gettin' impatient."
Bloody good timin'. Just got some more clients.
"All right, anythin' in particular strike your fancy?"
Bout time. Brynjolf's been gettin' on me about money.
Great. What do you want to do?
You're not getting anything until you pay the Guild back.
"I think you should finish that special assignment Delvin gave you, then we'll talk."
"I handle the burglary, shill, sweep and heist jobs. Most of them involve breaking and entering."
"If you don't like that kind of work, talk to Delvin. He runs the more up-close and personal jobs."
"Okay, what'll it be?"
"Got plenty, take your pick."
Got more than you can handle.
I bet you are. Which one do you want?
"Good, we could use the coin."
We have to go through town and across the bridge to get to Bleak Falls Barrow.
"You can see it from here, though. The mountain just over the buildings."
Sybille Stentor has a grasp of magical theory that I would never have expected from a human. Even a Breton.
No doubt most folk in Skyrim consider the dragons terrifying. I find them... wondrous.
Spiced wine for ya? It's a family recipe.
Wanderer like you needs a little fire in the veins. Some spiced wine?
"Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done."
"I'm too old to work, but that don't make me too old to drink."
You got nothin' better to do than bother an old man?
You want to know the one truth I've learned in all my years? Life's too hard to face sober.
"Hmm? Sorry, I was lost in thought. I'm planning my wedding, you see. So many details to work out."
Some say I got my position because my cousin is the Emperor. Nonsense. The man's given me nothing. He can't even be bothered to attend my wedding.
Good business for the East Empire Company means all the more gold for the Empire.
I don't have time for anyone too lazy or cowardly to make their own way in this world.
"I swear, I left another bottle right here..."
"If you see my father Octieve around, stay clear. He'll only ask you for money or mead."
Seems there's no end to the needs of the Imperials. But what can I help you with?
"When the Stormcloaks took Solitude, I thought for sure things would slow down. But they keep me just as busy as the Imperials."
Wanderer like you must have plenty of tales to tell. But I'm afraid I'm too busy to hear 'em.
"I got some fine armor, if you're lookin'."
"Need a weapon? Hmmm... By the looks of ya, yeah... Think I've got somethin' you can use."
It's good to be away from the forge for a bit.
"As high priest of the Eight Divines, I bid you welcome."
"As high priest of the Nine Divines, I bid you welcome."
"We welcome you to worship the Eight Divines, freely and openly."
"We welcome you to worship the Nine Divines, freely and openly."
"Wander no more, for you are among friends here, and safe."
"I'm afraid I'm running errands at the moment. But please, visit me later at the Temple of the Divines."
"Well, now. I'm afraid you've caught me a bit out of my element. Most of my time is spent in the Temple of the Divines, you see."
Blessings be with you.
Blessings of the Eight Divines upon you. How may I help?
Blessings of the Nine Divines upon you. How may I help?
You look troubled. Have you come seeking guidance?
"Feel free to take a seat, or pray at the shrines. We appreciate worship in all its forms."
Blessings to you. The Divines are listening.
"The Divines saved me from the streets, and they can save you from your trials, as well."
May the Divines guide and keep you.
"May you be saved by the Divines, as I once was."
I have no business with you. Leave me.
Go away. I have more important things on my mind right now.
I don't like strangers...
"You, talk to egg-brothers. Deeja has no words for you."
You have no knowledge of who you speak to. Go away.
You want knives? You want them in your belly? No? Then you stop talking to Deeja.
Dock work is not good work. Better than Black Marsh though. Much better.
"Oh my, old Ma'zaka has a visitor!"
What brings you all the way out here?
"Oh, for the salt spray, the creek of the mast, and the clash of sabers. Those were the days..."
Hey! Wanna play tag?
Hiya! What's your name? Are you visiting? What do you do?
"Papa says I won't see Roggvir any more, but he wouldn't tell me why not."
"My papa says I'm greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him! He says it means [QUOTE]smart,[QUOTE] but my brother says he's wrong."
"Papa used to say I was greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him. I miss him..."
Spare some gold for a veteran?
"Can you spare a septim? Lost an eye during the Great War, or I'd earn it myself..."
"I hid here in Solitude for a long time but war, war follows a man until it's done with him."
"Them Imperials left me to die in Anvil, and I had to fight my way back home. Then they followed me back here!"
Plenty of fresh fish for ya.
I've got some salmon to sell.
You shouldn't leave Solitude without trying our fish. Best in Skyrim.
I... I don't want to talk.
I don't have anything to say.
Pardon me.
Mother says I shouldn't talk to people...
Are you here to talk about my brother? Do you think his execution was justified?
I'm not looking for conversation.
"If you want to talk about my brother, I'm not interested."
I'm in mourning. Can't you see that?
"Ah, welcome to Angela's Aromatics. Can I help with some herbal needs?"
Need something for a potion? You're certainly in the right place.
"So, what are your needs? Perhaps a pinch of this, and a bit of that? Hmm?"
You were there for Roggvir's execution...
"If you're looking for potions you should talk to my aunt, Angeline Morrard."
"If you're looking for potions, I think I can be of service."
I'm a little busy at the moment. I've got all sorts of errands to run.
"You look like an adventurous one. I bet we're kindred spirits, you and I."
Beirand said you got here just before the execution. Must have been a lovely first sight.
"Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything."
"Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand did. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything."
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what Beirand always tells me.
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what my Beirand always told me...
Hey! Wanna play tag?
I thought adventurers were supposed to look tough?
I bet my papa could beat you up.
I bet my papa could have beat you up. He was stronger than anyone.
I get to help mother with the shop. I used to help papa too... 'till I tried to use the forge...
"If you're heading to the Blue Palace, you might want to rethink that outfit."
"If you ever want to replace those old rags, stop by Radiant Raiment."
"Why, hello! Here to buy? If you have to ask the price, you may be in the wrong store."
"We provide clothing for all of Solitude's most... influential residents. But for you, I'll make an exception."
"Oh, what delight. Another charming customer..."
So good to see you again. How can I be of service?
Let me just drop everything to help you. I don't mind. Really.
"I can help with purchases, but if you came to talk, see my sister. She's the one who gets on with people. It's her one virtue, really."
"Welcome to the Winking Skeever, friend."
"If you need a good rumor or two, I think I can oblige..."
"Traitors, civil wars, dragons. Bah. Those troubles don't cross my doorway. So sit, relax."
Feel free to make requests.
There's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit in troubled times.
"Have a drink, rest your feet and stay a little while."
Uh oh. A fellow bard. I best not miss my notes or forget any lyrics.
"New in town, right? If you need a place to sleep, head over to the Winking Skeever. We keep a fine inn."
"You know, the Winking Skeever's not just the best inn in Solitude. It's the also the only inn in Solitude."
Don't mind me. I'm just running errands for the old man.
I'm just running some errands for the old man... Err... For myself. I'm just running some errands for myself...
Seems there's always more to be done...
Glad you decided to check us out.
Soft sheets and hard liquor. What's not to like?
Welcome to Solitude. Home of the arts here in Skyrim.
"It is my personal mission to ensure that the Bards College preserves the great deeds of the past, in both poetry and song."
"I generally don't involve myself in politics. Good tales deal with the issues of the day, but a wise bard remains a neutral observer."
We bards record history - we do not make it. You'd do well to remember that.
"Never forget, the most important job of any bard is to entertain. The day you lose your audience is the day you cut your lute strings."
"Youngest bard at the Bards College, at your service."
"Anything I can do for you, I will."
The pleasure's all mine.
"Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist."
It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.
"If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous too travel."
"To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time."
"I'm Dean of Lute at the Bards College, and no, I don't give private lessons."
It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.
Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.
"You here to apply at the Bards College? Well don't bother - you're too damned old. Start past four, and it's all wasted effort."
"Hello, yes? I'm the Dean of History. And scribe work, when I can find some quiet time."
"My position, [QUOTE]Dean of History,[QUOTE] actually covers a wide range of subjects. I teach poetry, writing, history, and the finer points of court life."
"What a fascinating time to be alive! Mark me, these days will be remembered long after we're gone."
"If you love history, you're in the right place. Skyrim is steeped in it."
I wish only to graduate and enroll with the Legion. My drums will lead our troops to victory.
"It's an honor to have Viarmo for instruction on drum, but he's far too reserved for my tastes."
Viarmo is too concerned with precision. What of instinct? Hmm? What of passion?
"Lisette's a fine lass, but when I join the Legion, she's not the type to wait for my return."
Lady Ateia says my voice is second only to hers. But she's selling me short.
Few can resist my charms. Even fewer are worthy of them.
"I can't understand why Jorn would want to join the Imperial Legion. Soldiers only appreciate one thing, and it isn't music."
"You're new here, right? Welcome to the Bards College. It's like a... musical museum."
"Dean Inge says a bard can never have enough practice. So, would you like a tune?"
I'm so glad you got back from Olaf's Tomb okay. They gave you a tougher task then they gave me.
"You know, I don't get the impression that I'm very well liked at the College..."
"Thane Bryling, at your service."
I can always find time to share a word with a warrior.
"Many condemn the Stormcloaks, but I refuse. There is honor in fighting for what you believe."
This godsforsaken war is dividing our people and destroying our land.
"Unless we have specific business, I'm not interested."
I think Bryling's the one you want to talk to. I'm mostly just here to scare away the riff raff.
You don't want to talk to me. I'm just a stand in for a dead Thane.
"When I was a young rascal, I broke a man's arm with a single punch. Course, I had a horseshoe hidden in my glove..."
"The Imperials are good for business, and business is good for Skyrim."
"Bryling's obsession with honor and tradition is quaint, but politically irrelevant."
I understand what's best for Solitude... and Jarl Elisif knows it.
"Half of the businesses in town owe me money, and I own most of the rest. I practically run Solitude already."
"Please address all questions to the Steward, Falk Firebeard."
My duty is to keep the Jarl safe. Not play nursemaid to you sycophants.
"Keep your weapon out of your hands, and we'll get along just fine."
The Jarl has advised me not to talk about which court attendants I'd like to punch in the face. More's the pity.
Hello. I'm Gisli. But you can just call me Erikur's sister. Everyone does.
Welcome to the center of the world. Or at least my brother Erikur's world...
Have you met my dear brother Erikur? The man's as trustworthy as a Khajiit goldmonger.
"Quickly, if you please. I'm quite busy running errands for my bastard of a brother..."
"Speak if you must, but mind your tongue. I do not suffer fools gladly."
"Working for Erikur may be below my stature, but the compensation is... acceptable."
"You look like you could do with a ripe apple. Or a tomato, cabbage or leek?"
An apple to keep you healthy? A tomato to keep you strong? Surely you need one or the other...
"You get around, right? If you come across any Stormcloaks... gut one for me. They did the same to my brother in Whiterun."
"Mind yourself in my city, friend. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight..."
"Mind yourself in my city, lass. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight..."
"You stay out of trouble, now. The Castle Dour dungeon can break even the strongest will."
Not much work being a jailor. Long as you can ignore the pleading and all that.
Ain't many visitors come to the dungeon. Every now and then Sybille Stentor will come by looking for... volunteers.
"If you have business, please see Falk Firebeard, my steward."
"With the passing of my dear husband Torygg, the weighty position of Jarl has fallen to me. Please direct questions to my Steward."
"Ulfric is a fool and a coward, who naively believes he can bring about peace through warfare. It's rather sad, really."
"Thanks to Ulfric's rebellion, countless innocent people can't feed or clothe their families. It's unacceptably tragic."
Do you have business with the court?
"I am the Jarl's Steward. If you have court business to tend to, you talk to me."
The Jarl is not to be disturbed with common affairs of court. You direct those concerns to me.
"Just arrive in the city? Is it true what they say, then? There are dragons about?"
"Think I'll forge me a new sword, just in case things go awry here in Solitude. I'm the blacksmith's apprentice, you see."
"We've got strong swords and sturdy armor, if you're looking to buy."
"Apprentice blacksmith, at your service."
"Blacksmith, at your service."
Be quick. I have little patience for mundane concerns.
I have so very many ways to deal with people. Very few of them pleasant.
You're trying my patience.
Surely you have something better to do...
"Jarls come and jarls go, but a good cook stays for a lifetime. And I'm a very, very good cook."
"Everyone knows General Tullius wields the real power Solitude. Elisif? Ah, she's a figurehead. A puppet."
"Folks at court won't admit it, but Sybille Stentor scares us all to death."
"Somethin' just ain't right about that Sybille. You know, I've never seen her eat a thing? That can't be natural."
"Most of the time, people just forget I'm even here. That's why I hear so much good gossip."
"Oh, hello! Just tidying up."
So exciting when new folk come into town. I bet you've had plenty of adventures.
"Someday, a gallant hero will ride up and take me away. Someday..."
"Someday, I'll be a gallant heroine. You make it look so.. appealing."
"Are you my gallant hero? Have you come to whisk me away, to a life of adventure and romance?"
"Maybe you need a partner? Hmm? Just picture it. Two women, the dusty road, strapping men at every tavern, a fortune in gold to be claimed..."
"I made a wish in the town well that a golden knight came to take me to his castle. Oh, does it spoil the wish if I tell?"
Watch your feet. We just cleaned there!
Got lots of things to take care of. What do you need?
"Hello, my child. Arkay watch over you."
"May Arkay bless you with a long life, a proud death, and a restful grave."
"Hello and welcome, my friend. How may I help you on this fine day?"
"True, I may look the part of dashing swordsman, but I prefer the art of wit to that of warfare."
"Your typical Solitude wench is like the city itself. Stormy exterior, but ah the charms that lie within..."
A sharp mind beats a sharp blade any day. Words to live by.
"Ah, yet another new face. I'm from Hammerfell, you see. I can hardly keep track of all the people I've been meeting."
"Always good to see a fellow traveler. I hope you've found the roads relatively safe. Free from dragons, at the very least..."
"If you're looking for any archery or fletching supplies, you should see Fihada. I'm just the apprentice."
"Fletching suits me. It's difficult, and sometimes tedious. But a well made arrow strikes forth like the fury of a god."
You here for my next interrogation? I got nothing but time...
"Leave me be, Imperial. I haven't got anything to say to you."
Don't think I don't know what's coming.
It's only a matter of time before Ahtar's blade finds my neck...
You got business at the stables?
Work hard for the future and leave the past be. That's my motto.
"With a wife like Fridrika and a son like Horm, I'm the luckiest man in Skyrim."
"You wouldn't know it, but before my family got killed? I was the luckiest man in Skyrim."
"Is this about the stables? My husband, Geimund, handles the business."
"Is this about the stables? With my husband gone, my son Horm handles the business."
"I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's much I can help you with."
"My family's weathered its share of problems, but we don't dwell on the past."
"Looking for a horse? You'll want to talk to my father, Geimund."
"Need a horse? I guess I'm the one to talk to, since my da passed..."
I grew up tending some of these horses. They're almost family.
"When I was a boy, there was a year we couldn't afford enough feed. So I snuck my dinner out to the stables, and gave it to the horse."
"Come in, come in! I was just about to take a break."
"Living outside the walls is a risk, aye. But at least the guards don't come nosin' around."
"We had some trouble, while back. Stormcloak tried to set the mill on fire. But we sorted her out."
What do you want?
"Out here at work, Hjorunn treats me like an equal. Better than most in town."
"Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But some days, Hjorunn's too drunk..."
"Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But with Hjorunn gone..."
"My duty is simple - oversee the Thalmor Justiciars, and make sure they perform their duties admirably."
"The Empire, in its wisdom, has come to recognize Talos worship as a barbaric remnant of a bygone age."
"Talos was a heroic man, but not a god. It pains the Altmer that we must remind our younger cousins of the difference."
"We only want what is best for Tamriel. Surely, the rebels will accept peace when they realize this."
I could swear I've seen you somewhere before...
Can I help you?
My husband handles the indoor work. Just as well - he'd only hurt himself out here.
"It's hard work keeping Solitude fed, but I wouldn't trust any other family to do it."
"Oh, hello. Have a seat, will you?"
I was a much younger man when I married Katla. Now I can hardly keep up with her.
"My brothers would have been appalled to see a man outdone by his wife, but not me. Without Katla, this farm would fall apart."
You're a guest. And father says we have to be polite to guests.
Mama said I could help with the goats!
"Father says I don't have the knack for reading, but mama says I won't need it to work the farm."
Good day to you.
Do you have business with the East Empire Company?
I will thank you not to interrupt me in my tasks.
You'd better have a damned good reason for being here...
It takes a brave soul to wander onto my deck. It'll take more than that to leave in one piece.
"I'd say you're either brave or stupid, but I can already tell which one it is."
You must have a death wish.
You reek. A little friendly advice - take a bath and get some new clothes.
"Whatever you're about to say, don't bother. I don't want to hear it."
What hole did you crawl out of?
"Out of my way, or I'll cut you. Deep."
"I've only been a part of the Red Wave's crew for a few weeks, but I've already learned to stay out of Captain Safia's way."
"Forget wine, women and wealth - give me a calm sea and a good book, and I'm happy."
I hear Adonato Leotelli's staying up in Windhelm. I've read a few of his works. Be good to meet him someday.
"Don't misunderstand me, friend. I like my quiet, and I like to read. But you trifle with my ship, my crew, or my captain? I will kill you."
You've not seen the night sky until you've seen it on the open sea.
My father was all the family I ever had. I felt so lost when he died. But the crew of the Red Wave's my family now.
I've seen some truly wondrous sights since I took to the seas. I had no idea a man could die in so many ways...
"Just yesterday, I saw a musician in the street playing a flute. It was... beautiful. I want that flute."
"Dorian is helping me perfect my fencing, but I don't think I'll ever be as good as he is."
You've found the Bards College kitchen. Congratulations.
Meals are served to Bards at designated times. Find an inn if you want to make requests.
You look a little sturdier than most of the Popinjays around here.
"I once captained a ship called the Argent Raptor. She struck an iceberg and went down, just north of Windhelm."
"My shipmates scoff at my love of finery, but I know envy when I hear it."
From ship's captain to lowly crewman... I suppose I deserve it after wasting all my coin on gambling and women.
"I hail from Cyrodiil, but after a... misunderstanding with the law, I needed a swift change of scenery."
"If it's arms or armor you need, see Beirand in Castle Dour. Bloody good blacksmith, that one."
"If you need potions, head over to Angeline's Aromatics."
You can sell off that junk at Bits and Pieces.
The Winking Skeever's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.
"I don't abide fancy clothes, but you look like you might. I hear Radiant Raiments has a large selection."
"Off the coast a ways to the east, you'll find the wreck of the Brinehammer. Never know what treasures may still be aboard."
You heard of Ravenscar Hollow? Cave on the island to the west. Place is a roost for those foul Hagravens.
"If you must venture southwest, stay clear of Volskygge. It is a cursed place, a tomb where the dead still live..."
"The road to Whiterun's not safe these days. Lots of travelers just... disappear, south of Dragon Bridge. Can't find a trace of them."
"Pinemoon Cave is down to the southwest, but it ain't fit for exploring. There are stories... Vampires, some say..."
Been up to the Blue Palace? It's a sight to see. Even if it is filled with fops...
"We couldn't have taken this city without you, sir."
"We couldn't have taken this city without you, ma'am."
Everything's in order.
Solitude is as glorious as they said it was. Nothing like Falkreath where I grew up.
"Don't talk to me, defiler."
I have no words. Talk to Anwen.
Pick up your mess. Then we'll talk.
I'm not going to talk to you until this mess is cleaned up.
Talk to me again when you've cleaned up your mess.
You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat!
"Tell you what - you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff."
"We're married. I guess we'll need to decide where we're living, won't we? You can always stay with me."
"I guess we have our entire lives together, now. Where should we live? You could stay with me...."
We face the world together now. Where should we live? My home is yours.
"We're united, but where should we live? My home is yours, of course."
"I'm a married man! Hey, where should we live? I guess you could always stay with me."
"This is the happiest day of my life. Where should we live? My home is your home now, of course."
"Married. It doesn't feel like I thought it would, but I'm happy. Where should we live? You could stay with me...."
The mine will be running better than ever thanks to you.
"Nasty little buggers, aren't they?"
The spiders put you through the ringer?
I hope you haven't arrived here looking for work in the mine.
"Sorry, the mine's dry right now."
"I hate seeing a good mine go to waste like that, you know?"
"If you're looking for supplies, I'd advise heading to Riften."
What brings you out to Shor's Stone?
Everything was going great in Redbelly. Then the damn spiders showed up.
"You think you're tough, huh? Wandering Skyrim is a picnic compared to tunnel crawling!"
The real work happens in places like this. Blood and sweat is what makes the world turn.
"Sure, I used to be a soldier... but that was child's play compared to cracking rock."
"Mining's my life now, I wouldn't want to do anything else."
Making that trip to Darkwater Crossing was a huge help. Thank you.
I trust my parents are well?
Would you happen to be headed towards Darkwater Crossing?
Welcome to Shor's Stone.
Have you ever been to Darkwater Crossing? Terrible name for such a beautiful place.
"I suppose you're used to traveling, being a stranger around here."
"Came all the way out here to see us, did you?"
Ha! You showed those spiders a thing or two!
You're looking at the best miner in Skyrim.
I'd wager I could crack rock faster than anyone. Even you.
"Takes a lot of strength to swing a pick axe, know what I mean?"
"Aye, I see the look you're giving me. Don't worry, I won't bite."
"Morthal used to be a quiet place. But then, the world used to make sense."
"You ask me, we'd be better off without that wizard in town."
"This isn't the time or place for magic, or whatever it is Falion does."
"I figure the guards could always use some help, so I keep my eyes open."
"Been hoping they'd make me a guard, but not yet. Still, I'll help them out if I can."
The Jarl does little to protect us these days.
"A new face! Such a welcome sight in dreary old Morthal. Welcome friend, welcome!"
"Don't fret over the gloom, there's nothing to fear! Old Lurbuk will brighten your spirits -- just lend him your ear!"
The good people of Morthal have yet to embrace my talent.
"Try as you may, they won't say [QUOTE]good day,[QUOTE] but will just walk away. Worry not, Morthal! Lurbuk is here to stay!"
The fair Jonna does me a great courtesy by allowing me to entertain the guests of her noble establishment.
"I, Lurbuk the Great, will win the hearts of the people of Morthal one day, mark my words!"
"Welcome to the Moorside. If you need anythin', I'll be 'round. Good to have a customer."
"There ain't much to offer, but if you wanna place dry to spend the night, I'll rent you a room."
"Runnin' an inn weren't my plan. But Falion decided to move here, so I joined him."
"Falion had his work to keep him busy, and I needed somethin' to do. So, here I am."
I take what little business I can git. I'm grateful for anyone willin' to spend money here.
"Ignore the Orc. He pays, so I let him stay."
I've tried to explain to Lurbuk that his [QUOTE]singin'[QUOTE] is gonna get his throat cut.
You'll want to be careful travelin' at night. The marsh is a dangerous place.
"So, life has brought you to Morthal, and to me. What purpose this serves, we will no doubt see. Welcome."
"Tamriel is full of wisdom and magic, if one is willing to look for it. Few have their eyes open."
"Dark times, indeed. I fear the worst for Morthal and my people."
"I try and take comfort in knowing that when all is lost, there is much to be gained."
It is my hope that I will one day return to Hjaalmarch. But the Divines have not shown this to me.
"I speak, and others hear. It is my hope that instead they listen."
"In Morthal, there is little to rule. But there is much to teach. And so, I am Jarl."
All this talk of rebellion and strife. Too many are focused on what might be instead of what is. It tires me to talk about it.
"There is too much to learn in the world, too much to know, to fight over [QUOTE]laws[QUOTE] that have no real purpose."
We're safe here now. But what of Morthal?
"The Empire brought stability, assurance to the people of Morthal, even if they didn't appreciate it. Now what do they have?"
I fear for what this change will do to my family.
"If you've business with the Jarl, I'd ask that you speak to me first."
"I do what I can to see that Idgrod's time isn't wasted, and that she only has to deal with important matters."
"Too many bother my wife with their petty problems, and then don't even understand the advice she gives them."
The only thing that matters to me is keeping my wife safe. I won't let anyone harm her.
"Morthal doesn't need any trouble. You keep your nose clean, understand?"
My mind weighs heavy enough. Leave me to my food.
Leave Idgrod and her family alone. They've been through enough.
This wasn't what I wanted. Not at all.
All that ever mattered was what was best for Morthal. Leaving it in Ulfric's hands... It's not right.
"I'm just here to protect the Jarl, not to chat."
Morthal has enough problems without you bothering me.
"I'm under a lot of pressure. If you don't leave me alone, I won't be held responsible."
"Please don't mind Joric. He's not mad, really he's not."
"To be driven from our homes, to be forced here... this is the last thing that Joric needs."
"I don't... I haven't mother's gift, not quite, but I've seen things."
Someday I'll be Jarl. Mother reminds me often. I hope I can help the people of Morthal the way she has.
It's difficult sometimes... To know whether what I see is real or not.
"I keep hoping this is another vision, that it's not real. But it is, isn't it? We really have lost our home."
"For now, looking after Joric is my job."
"You're different, aren't you? Not like anyone else. Not in Morthal, or Skyrim."
I don't understand. Why can't we go home?
I can't sleep here. The dreams are even worse than before.
"I get lost sometimes. I'm not sure where I go, but I'm not... I'm not here."
"Gorm thinks I'm mad. He doesn't say it, but I know he thinks it. Is he right?"
"My mother sees things. She doesn't know why, but she does. Only sometimes, she doesn't see me at all."
"It's Falion. He... He did it. I don't know what it was, but he did it."
Keep your wits about you. Morthal's hardly a safe place.
I'm just a poor man trying to make a living. I'd leave Morthal were it in my power.
This damned war has cost us... me... everything.
"My boy's to grow up without a mother? What life is that? It's not right, I tell you."
Hasn't been seen for a while. She just vanished without a trace.
Some say the swamp took her. Part of me wishes it were that simple.
Have you seen my mother? I'm still waiting for her to come home.
Papa says that I shouldn't keep waiting. Why not? Mama has to come home some time.
"Who are the Stormcloaks, and why would mama want to spend time with them instead of me?"
I know you for what you are. This town's blood is ours. Leave it! Now we must return to our roles lest the sheep suspect the wolves.
"Well, aren't you the handsome one. You and I should spend some time together."
"Well, aren't you the pretty one. I bet all the men chase after you."
"The people here work so hard, and they never allow themselves a moment of fun. It's such a pity. It won't last forever though."
"These people are like cattle. All they do is work, sleep and eat."
"Gathering plants, picking mushrooms, brewing potions. It all gets so dreary after a while. This town needs something exciting to happen."
Thank you for saving me from Alva. I was completely under her evil spell. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to Helgi and my wife.
I... I'm not one for talk. Try to keep to myself.
"Alva's been good to me ever since... well, since the fire."
"I just try and do my job, and not to think about what's happened. Try to find what happiness I can."
Ignore the talk of spirits and creatures and such. It's just superstition.
There's enough real troubles in the world without making new ones up.
You are new to Morthal. We have not spoken before. This is interesting.
"The changes in Morthal are of little consequence to me. So long as the laws are upheld, I do not care who does the upholding."
"My talents are much needed here, in order to keep Morthal... safe."
"Morthal is a troubled place, and it is my duty to see it rest in peace."
Please remain indoors at night. It is dangerous to go outside.
Do you like magic? Falion says I'm good at learning. I like learning about magic.
My mother and father died years ago. Falion takes care of me now.
"I asked Falion if someday I could learn from the mages in Winterhold, but he doesn't like that idea."
"If you need any alchemy supplies, I'll do my best to provide them. Assuming I haven't used them all up."
"Jorgen and I both work hard, all the time. Morthal is important to both of us."
"I don't get many customers, but that leaves me time to try things out. Experiment, I guess."
"Unless it's about the mill, I don't have time to talk. Too much to do."
We've gone from a Jarl lost in her own head to a Jarl that cares for nothing but herself. Lot of good that does us.
"The mill is my responsibility, and that's what I care about. That's all. Understand?"
"I just want to be left alone to do my job, and to enjoy what little free time I have when I have it."
"We've got all the miners we need, so I hope you're not here looking for work."
"Hjaalmarch isn't much, but it's a good start. I'll make a name for myself here, then maybe work my way up to someplace like Riften."
"Finally, my leadership is being recognized."
Nothing here but the mine. Probably best you keep moving.
"Pactur and I, we make sure the miners aren't stealing, and that the ore makes it to Solitude."
It's good that Sorli has finally been given some real authority.
I'll see to it that Sorli is safe now that she's running Morthal.
We left Sirgar in charge back at Stonehills. I hope that wasn't a mistake.
Sorli and I are just here to make sure the mine is run proper.
"Wouldn't ever have expected to wind up living in a place like this, but the money's good."
Don't bother the miners. They've got work to do.
I'm in charge now that my parents are in Morthal.
I figured that I would run the mine someday. I just didn't figure that would mean now.
"Guess the Empire's going to need plenty of iron what with all the fighting. That'll be good for us, I suppose."
Talk to my parents if you need something.
My parents keep a close eye on the miners. They can't be trusted too much.
"I hear there's been fighting in Skyrim. Rebellion, maybe. Wonder if our iron is being used for weapons."
"If you're here about the mine -- it's already got an owner, and she's not selling. If not, then please stay out of my workers' way."
"You get used to the cold after a while. The harder you work, the warmer you stay."
I spend every waking moment making sure the mine is put to good use.
Bryling owns this mine. I wouldn't have much to live for if she hadn't offered me a job.
My job is my life. Whatever happened before doesn't matter.
I'm just here to work the mine. Nothing else matters anymore.
"The outside world means little to us, and we'd like it to stay that way."
"When you work hard enough, really get into a rhythm, everything else just fades away."
I'm just trying to make a living. I've no interest in trouble.
My business is my own. Why can't others see that?
The mine gives us purpose. Something many of us have wished for.
"Stonehills' warmth is a welcome change in this cold, bleak land."
Teeba-Ei the hatchling never imagined working a mine in this cold place. Greater things were dreamt of.
This is not where Teeba-Ei was meant to live out the rest of his days.
We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked.
"I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill."
The Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things. I can't be a part of that.
"Gods, I can't run away from this. I have to stop her."
I'm going with you whether you like it or not.
Let's get up there before mother finds out what we're doing.
You want in there? Here's my spare key. Take whatever you want.
Alva? Didn't think she had it in her.
So Alva did it to get Hroggar for herself? I should have suspected her.
I assume you have proof? Can't go making accusations like that without proof.
By the gods! I assume you have proof.
"Bah. If there was a tonic that could help me, I would have found it by now..."
You would do that? It's good to know there are some people out there who are willing to help an old man.
"It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in a long forsaken cave to the west of here."
"Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place."
"Luckily for you, I've already made the mixture. Here, take it."
Please... don't dally. I've wasted enough time arguing with my useless assistant here.
"A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice."
"A small container, made of the magically infused snow that first fell on the Throat of the World."
It is said that the Phial will replenish whatever fluid is placed inside of it.
"For an alchemist like myself, it is the most pure expression of my art. To create from nothingness is... poetry."
I have spent my entire life searching for it.
It brought me all the way to these frozen reaches from the warm embrace of Summerset Isle.
Entire years spent in libraries. Seeking out tiny villages with local legends that contain but a whisper of a hint of the Phial.
"I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it."
"And now it's within my grasp... but the Eight, it seems, have chosen me for their amusement."
"... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it."
"Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to."
"But by Sithis, I hope I'm making the right choice here. You may be an effective killer, but your command of guile leaves much to be desired."
The sealed letter you delivered to me was mysteriously unsealed upon its arrival. I can only assume you've read its contents. Sloppy...
But moving on to business. As you probably already know from reading the letter... you're going to a wedding.
"Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to."
Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding.
"Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride."
Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding.
And they say romance is dead.
Soon. I'm not exactly sure when. But not to worry - the ceremony itself is being followed up by a public banquet that will last for several days.
"Both Vittoria and her husband will be there for the duration, and everyone in Solitude is invited to attend. You'll have plenty of opportunity."
"An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II."
Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation.
So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire.
The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.
"Every now and again, we like to remind the shopkeepers that we're in charge."
"If that means breaking into their strongboxes and stealing something valuable from them, then so be it."
Feel like doing a bit of shopping... the Guild way?
Got a shop owner with a very choice item a client wants to get his hands on if you do the dirty work.
"Got a good one here involving a shop, a waylaid shipment of goods and an angry client. You fill in the blanks. You want in?"
I have just the place. The owner likes to stash some lovely trinkets in his strongbox like this beauty. Can you get it for us?
The owner of this place just inherited an heirloom from a relative. You want in?
"Sure. A client's relative lost this item in a gambling match and they're paying us to get it back. So much for fair play, huh?"
"The owner of this shop stiffed us on their last protection payment, but we're taking it anyway. You want to help us on this one?"
Jiit caravan brought this shop a nice piece from Elsweyr. Think you can break into their strongbox and get it for us?
"Got a client in desperate need for this item. He won't say what it's for, and we don't care. Can you take this one?"
"This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy."
"Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks."
"In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance."
"Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay."
"Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take."
All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks.
And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess.
Of course. Take what you need.
Of course. Take what you need.
But what's all this about? What are you two doing here?
Hadvar? How do you know him?
"Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason."
Just head north - you can't miss it.
"It's the capital of Whiterun Hold, the biggest and the best of the nine holds of Skyrim. But don't take my word for it."
"Cross the river and then head north. You'll see it, just past the falls."
"When you get to Whiterun just keep going up. When you get to the top of the hill, you're at Dragonsreach, the Jarl's palace."
"Just follow the road north. When you get to Honningbrew Meadery, turn left and the road will take you to the city gates."
"It's not far. We used to go to the market there every month or so, until the roads got so dangerous with the war and all."
"You really think I can be a blacksmith someday, papa? As good as Eorlund Gray-Mane? Or maybe... even as good as you?"
"Oh, I know it! You keep working hard, like you been doing, and you could be the greatest blacksmith Skyrim has ever seen."
"He he. Thanks, papa."
"You see, you're not well! Have a seat and I'll fetch you some tonic."
I'll... I can... just...
"Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey. We don't know what's inside..."
I'll be fine.
I'm so close to the answer...
May the Eight guide you to the Phial...
Please hurry -- I fear my master doesn't have much time left.
Good luck finding the fragments.
I'll just be tending the museum if you need me.
"Please, open the door. I need to get out of here."
Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me.
I hope we reach Markarth soon.
I can't wait to learn from the priestesses.
"Please, let's hurry to the Temple before the Forsworn find me again."
I hope Fjotra is happy in the temple. We're so honored to have given her.
Thank you for getting her back from the Forsworn. Dibella was smart to have sent you.
Let's get to the Forsworn camp. Her life could be in danger.
"I swear, if those things have laid a hand on her..."
Let's find Fjotra. This place gives me the creeps.
How could they live like this? It's disgusting.
"I'm sorry, the Temple of Dibella is closed. You can receive your blessing, if you wish, but the other sisters are in seclusion."
I've heard stories about the wonders of the great Temple in Markarth.
But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it.
"I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on."
"Now, there's no need to do anything rash..."
"This isn't as bad as it seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly! Please... he'll have me killed!"
"I see you wish to be reasonable, perhaps I misjudged you."
The name of the person you want is Karliah.
"All right, all right. It's Karliah... her name is Karliah."
They were a secret cabal of the three top rogues in the Thieves Guild. No one knew their identities.
"Some people say they watched over the group, others say they were reserved for the most elite jobs. I don't really know."
It wasn't until recently that I heard Mercer Frey and this Dark Elf named Karliah were a part of that group.
Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be bringing me nothing but trouble anyway.
"Karliah didn't even want it, she wanted to keep the sale a secret. I can see how well that went."
I thought it was painfully obvious that Gulum-Ei was important to the Guild.
I'm sorry to say your payment for the job will have to go to elsewhere since you feel like taking things in your own direction.
"Now, did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?"
Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?
"No, it.. it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades."
"This is grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with again."
Karliah destroyed everything this Guild stood for. She murdered my predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild.
"After we discovered what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just vanished."
Karliah and I were like partners. I went with her on every heist. We watched each other's backs.
"I know her techniques, her skills. If she kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her."
If only we knew where she was...
There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered Gallus... a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum.
We have to go out there before she disappears again.
"Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her."
Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
"Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her."
Here's your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
"I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves."
We both agree it's best to keep these matters in house.
I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike anything we've seen before.
"Now, I'm not sure that you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of experience, but can you feel that?"
"Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll have more information soon."
I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your associate immediately.
"Now, I..."
This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!
"Yes, I've no doubt of its gravity. This, however, is a matter that cannot wait."
"Well, I'm quite sure I've never been interrupted like this before... the audacity!..."
"I suppose we'll continue this at some later time, when we can avoid interruptions."
I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.
"Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation."
I'd like to know why there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here in the College.
"More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you specifically."
"So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and find out exactly what it is he wants."
"Now, you are going to speak to this... Monk... and find out why he is here, and then he will be removed from College grounds."
"Find out why he's here, and what he wants."
I'd simply like to talk to you.
"The Augur? Really? Well, it's certainly not my place to say anything about it."
I think you'd better go see Mirabelle Ervine.
"What? The Augur? Oh no, I'm quite sure that's... He's nothing I'm involved in. No, no."
"Mirabelle Ervine... Or Tolfdir. They're qualified to discuss him. Not me, definitely not."
"It's not enough that you've stolen the spotlight with this Eye thing, now you're looking for the Augur?"
"I'm not sure what you're playing at, but you'd do well to remember your place around here."
"The Augur? Tragic story, really. At least, the way I heard it. But that was a long time ago."
"It was some experiment gone horribly wrong. Ghastly results, I was told. And his ghost still roams the halls, they say."
"Of course, on further reflection, that may have simply been an attempt to scare me. Hmm."
Perhaps I'll ask Tolfdir what really happened. I understand he was here at the time.
"Oh, no. No, that won't do at all."
"Not my problem. Not even a little. Take it to Tolfdir, he's supposed to be looking after you lot."
That's nothing you need to concern yourself with.
The what of what? No. No idea.
"If it's important, maybe Tolfdir knows. He seems to know a lot."
Huh? That sounds ominous. Are you getting yourself into even more trouble?
"Did you ask Mirabelle? She runs things around here, after all."
"I've never heard of anything like that. Did you ask Tolfdir? He's been here a long time, and seems to know almost everything."
The what?
"No. No, I'm quite sure I have no idea what you're talking about."
I suggest you mind your own business and return to whatever it is you do here.
"Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time."
"My goodness, it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down in the Midden, but I haven't checked."
"Are you going to see him? Do tell him [QUOTE]hello[QUOTE] for me, won't you?"
Has Tolfdir been telling stories again? I thought I made it quite clear that this was a subject inappropriate for conversation.
Please don't allow him to continue to discuss the subject.
I am that which you have been seeking.
Your efforts are in vain. It has already begun.
But those who have sent you have not told you what they seek. What you seek.
"You shouldn't leave weapons laying around. Someone could get hurt. And if I see you do it again, that someone will be you."
Have I made myself clear?
See that it doesn't happen again.
No? Do you care about rotting away for a month in a cell?
"Ah, but nobody wants that, right? Painful for you, annoying for me. So, you pay my fine... and you walk away."
"See, that wasn't so difficult, was it."
"Is that so? Well then, I'll have to charge you with disturbing the Jarl's peace."
Come on. Let's see what you're made of.
Get him!
Get her!
Twelve septims on the big one!
Fight! Fight!
Drive that snowback to the ground. Come on!
You just going to stand there and take it? Fight back.
Who taught you to fight? Keep those hands up!
Don't let him get away with this!
Don't let her get away with this!
Get him!
Get her!
"Come on, he's not so tough."
"Come on, she's not so tough."
"You want a real fight, eh?"
"Master, look. It's the Phial."
What? How?
"It doesn't matter. Look, it's refilling with your tonic as we speak."
Marvelous.
He is gone.
"But thanks to you, he died knowing his life's work was not in vain."
As am I.
You acted very nobly in helping my master realize his life's work. Thank you for that.
"As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist."
"I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him."
"Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired."
You assaulted one of my family members. I've come to accept your apology.
You! Fetcher! I should kill you for assaulting my family. But I will accept your apology...
You know who I am? You attacked one of my clan. I've come to accept your apology... or your death.
You! You hurt my family. I don't like when my family gets hurt. Say you're sorry. Or say goodbye.
You attacked one of my family. What do you have to say for yourself?
"You can't attack my family and get away with it, fetcher! I will have an apology, or your head on a spike. Choose."
Dishonorable dog. You attacked one of my kin. So now you're going to apologize... or I'm going to lop off your head.
Here's the situation. You attacked my family. So now you're going to apologize.. or I'm going to kill you. I hope we understand each other...
I trust this is the last I'll hear of your violent outbursts.
Stay away from my family if you value your life.
Good. But know that further dishonor to my family will mean your death.
You stay away from my family. Or you die. Be smart. Stay away.
This had better be the last I hear of you disrespecting my family.
"Mark these words carefully, fetcher. Stay away from my family, or I will paint the ground with your blood."
"Any further dishonor done to my kin, and I'll put you in the ground."
"That wasn't so hard, now was it."
Come again?
I am prepared to deal with your insolence...
Fine. Then it will be an honor to kill you for your offenses against my kin.
Are you out of your mind?
"If you value your well being, you will offer an apology..."
You should be.
"You may care nothing of honor, but I do. I'm not leaving without an apology."
You sure you want it to come to this?
In your death may you find the honor you lacked in life.
What? You stupid or something?
Say you're sorry. Say it now.
That's it!
Really?
"You're making a fatal mistake. Apologize, and you may yet live..."
So be it.
I will not tolerate this offense against my kin.
"Are you mad? Apologize, or I will gut you like a horker."
"Then you are fool, and will die for it."
"Honor may mean nothing to you, but it means much to me. Your apology, or your life."
Only your death or an apology will restore my family's honor. Last chance.
Then I guess we're done talking.
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. Your best and least painful course of action is to apologize and promise to leave my family in peace.
No? You sure? 'Cause we're reaching the point of no return here...
Annnddd... Point of no return reached.
Hrrrmm.
"Hadvar! We've been so worried about you! Come, you two must be hungry. Sit down and I'll get you something to eat."
Sigrid! We have company!
"Now, then, boy. Helgen was destroyed? How did you get away?"
"Now, then, boy. What's the big mystery? What are you doing here, looking like you lost an argument with a cave bear?"
I don't know where to start. You know I was assigned to General Tullius's guard.
We were stopped in Helgen when we were attacked... by a dragon.
"When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either."
"A dragon? That's... ridiculous. You aren't drunk, are you boy?"
"Mara's mercy! A dragon... in Helgen? Why, it could be here at any moment!"
Husband. Let him tell his story.
Not much more to tell. This dragon flew over and just wrecked the whole place. Mass confusion.
I don't know if anyone else got out alive. I doubt I'd have made it out myself if not for my friend here.
I need to get back to Solitude and let them know what's happened.
"I thought you could help us out. Food, supplies, a place to stay."
Of course! Any friend of Hadvar's is a friend of mine. I'm glad to help however I can.
"Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have big teeth?"
"Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin."
"What'd you pick up there? Oh, I wish I saw that first. You're so lucky!"
"Hey, someone had to take it, right?"
Lucky for you that was just sitting there for the taking.
"Oh, wow! That was just sitting there? I wish I found it first."
Hope nobody misses that...
You just find that lying around? Must be your lucky day.
That was just lying around? Good find.
"Good, you're finally here."
I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside.
"No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it... she won't be using it to escape."
"Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead."
"I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge."
You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?
Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade.
The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here.
She was a stubborn Dunmer... always had to do everything her way.
But she was also the best... bringing in more coin a month than some thieves heist in a year.
Gallus trusted her too much and let her get too close.
"If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him for the kill."
Gallus would call her his [QUOTE]little nightingale.[QUOTE] He was absolutely smitten by her.
Twenty-five years ago I was standing outside these very same ruins. Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why.
"When I arrived, Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound an arrow pierced his throat."
"Before I could even draw my blade, her second arrow found its mark in my chest."
Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element of surprise. I was lucky... she missed my heart by mere inches.
I staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.
The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into a opening atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man.
"To this day I've regretted allowing her to escape, even if it meant I had died trying. I owed Gallus that much."
Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an iniquitous act.
One thing's certain. I intend to find out before she draws her last breath.
Who... who are you? What's going on?
Priest of Arkay. I'm your friend.
You're my... friend....
"She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it."
Not here. We will meet at Reachcliff Cave.
Bring Verulus here. The Lady of Decay will do the rest.
Go ahead. Eat.
"Soon, Namira's blessing will be yours."
We will sate the hunger together.
"Don't fear the unknown, the hidden, the wretched."
I will feast on you!
Glory to Namira!
Glory to the repulsive!
Namira grind your bones for my bread!
I will drink your blood and feast on your flesh!
"It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh?"
"Listen, I'm going to lay up here for a while. You can make your own way to Solitude from here."
"I'd recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there you can take a carriage to Solitude."
I hope I'll see you in Solitude. Good luck.
Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.
I hope that dragon isn't still flying around here somewhere.
"I still almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon..."
What do you need?
Yeah? What is it?
Did you really see a dragon?
Make yourself at home.
"Take what you need, my friend. Within reason, of course."
Uncle Alvor! Hello!
"Hadvar, thank Talos! Your friend told me about Helgen..."
Hadvar? What are you doing here? Are you on leave from...
"Shor's bones, what happened to you, boy?"
Are you in some kind of trouble?
"Shh.. Uncle, please. Keep your voice down. I'm fine. But we should go inside to talk."
What's going on? And who's this?
"He's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside."
"She's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside."
Come on inside. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell us what happened.
"Okay, okay. Come inside, then. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell me all about it."
"Ah, there you are."
"I've consulted my contacts regarding the information you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that symbol."
I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian couldn't find his tail with both hands.
"Don't get me wrong, he could scam a beggar out of his last septim... but he's no mastermind."
Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You have your work cut out for you.
"No, no. Mercer wants him alive, for now."
"Stubborn or not, he's the only contact we've got at the East Empire Company."
Just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company Warehouse. He helps maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of Solitude.
That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores.
"He isn't exactly in the Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the warehouse."
"There are thieves and then there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all. He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time."
"The cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying."
"Keep your eyes on him, he's quite crafty."
Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer. Nothing else is more important.
"If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding out on us and has more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find that information quite valuable as well."
A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry.
"The Emperor himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly unlimited resources... so don't get their feathers in a ruffle."
"So, what do we have here? Hmm. Let me guess."
"By your scent, I'd say you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore."
"Oh, wait... did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies."
"I'm sorry to say I know very little about that... bee farm, was it?"
"Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every deal I handle."
"This... it matches every description of the Phial that I've found in lore. But if it can't hold liquid, there's no way of knowing."
"How did you manage to damage it, then? This is what I get for not retrieving it myself."
Thank the gods. I'll get to work on the Phial straight away.
"Even though the Phial was damaged, I still think your efforts deserve reward."
"Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm going to tend to Nurelion. I can make his final days a bit less painful."
"Find the three vessels within Valthume, then return to me. With these we can defeat him."
"In life, Hevnoraak drained his own blood from his body. His goal was to transfer his power back into himself after death, becoming a powerful lich."
The vessels contain that very blood. Empty them and you remove any chance he has of regaining his former powers.
"More dangerous than you know. Left alone, however, he will awaken when he has grown too powerful to be stopped. This is the only way to be sure."
"Very well. Empty the vessels into the sconce near the throne, then sit in the throne."
"When you have done so, I will unbind Hevnoraak. He will awaken in a weakened state, but the lich is still to be reckoned with. Be ready."
"Yes, old friend, I'm afraid it's not good news."
When you broke up the binding Potema escaped. We've encountered some of her minions.
Styrr says she's still in spirit form or we'd all be dead already.
"You've already done us a service in stopping the binding, but I need you to go talk to him, to see if Styrr can tell us what to do next."
That'll teach you to break the law on my watch.
I thought it was finally going to be a quiet day.
You really thought you could get away with it?
Don't get any bright ideas.
"Stop, in the name of the Jarl!"
Come quietly or taste the Jarl's justice!
"By order of the Jarl, I command you to halt!"
Sheathe your weapons and come quietly!
"Halt, outlander!"
"Surrender or die, outlander!"
"Clanfolk, stop the outlander!"
"Hold, there!"
Lay down your weapons!
We are ready to mount our final attack.
Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.
Join the forces mustering outside of [CAPITAL]. (Infos conditioned on Capital location go here)
"The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!"
"Sometimes we like to remind a city that we mean business, so we hit it hard. Just steal whatever we can until we've made an impression."
Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows.
"Steal from anywhere in the hold, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?"
I always have bedlam jobs. Just remember to hit them fast and don't let them see you. Feel like going for it?
"Of course. Don't forget to keep out of sight, it doesn't count if they catch you red-handed. You ready?"
"Taking an easy job, eh? Well, go and do some damage. Just stick to the shadows and keep out of sight. Want to go for it?"
I'm sorry to be such a bother. We'll talk another time.
"Is that so? You ought to join the Stormcloaks, if you haven't already."
"Seems to me they're a bunch of narrow-minded bigots, just like you."
"Meantime, you best steer clear of me."
Good. Too many Nords in this town have been listening to Ulfric's narrow-minded words.
"He's tough, loyal to his men and a good leader, but if you're not a Nord, Ulfric will never trust you."
That's just what Ulfric wants you to think.
"If that's what you really believe, then you're a fool. Never had much patience for fools, myself."
"And you're right, at least as far as I'm concerned."
Don't let Ulfric or some of these other short-sighted Nords bother you. Most of us are happy to welcome newcomers.
"If I make it back to Solitude, I'll put in a good word for you with General Tullius."
The Legion could sure use someone like you. Good luck.
You one of those [QUOTE]Skyrim for the Nords[QUOTE] types?
"I killed a lot of High Elves in the Great War, and I didn't die. I guess that makes me a war hero."
"The [QUOTE]Great War[QUOTE]... there was nothing great about it. Thousands died on both sides, and where did it get us?"
"Did we really save the Empire? Or did we just plant the seeds for Ulfric's uprising, and another war?"
"Help the Dark Elves? Oh, you must have heard me talking to Malthyr."
The Dark Elves live in a run-down slum called the Gray Quarter. Ulfric's content to keep it that way.
"I guess they think I can open Ulfric's eyes to their plight, and get him to lift a finger on their behalf."
"I'm trying, but Ulfric is set in his ways. For him, there's two kinds of people in this world -- Nords, and the folk beneath them."
"I don't appreciate loiterers, if that's what you're here to do."
"I hope you have coin to spend, and you're not just here to gawk at my goods."
Have a look around. I buy and sell just about anything.
"I'm always happy to see a customer, but I won't deal in stolen goods. That's trouble I don't need."
"Make yourself at home, please. Let me know if I can be of any assistance."
Fresh fruit and vegetables for sale!
"Fruits and vegetables, all ripe and ready for your table!"
Take home Windhelm's finest and freshest produce today!
"Assorted fruits and vegetables, all delicious and affordable!"
Come and browse my fine selection! Everything's fresh and delicious!
"I've a little of everything for sale, come and see for yourself!"
"Cookware, knives and other goods for the home, all at reasonable prices!"
Assorted wares and tools you just can't live without! Come and see for yourself!
Buying and selling a wide range of assorted goods! The best selection in Windhelm!
"Go back to Morrowind, Dark Elf maggots! You're not welcome here!"
"Get out of our city, gray-skins! This is Nord land!"
"We don't want your kind here, dark elves!"
This place reeks of gray-skin filth!
"You like living in this filthy slum, dark elves? Maybe you should go back to Morrowind, where you belong!"
Spare a coin for a poor old woman?
A few septims for my supper is all I ask.
I ask only for a little charity.
Will you spare a few coins to help someone who's got nothing?
"I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims."
The Divines smile on those who show mercy an' charity.
"A few septims ain't nothing. You can spare that, can't you?"
"Hear my prayer, son of Akatosh, and grant peace to these departed souls."
"Lord of Seasons, I pray to you now that you might watch over the dead with mercy and kindness."
"Mighty Arkay, God of Mortals, hear now the prayers of your humble servant. Bless these departed souls and welcome them into the realms beyond."
"Mighty Arkay, I pray that you will shepherd these souls as they pass into the realm of death."
Feast your eyes on my strange and wondrous collection of curiosities.
"For a few septims, I'll give you a brief tour that includes some of my most unusual items."
"The objects you see here might look mundane at first glance, but I assure you, behind each is an unusual tale."
Windhelm is divided into four quarters. The Gray Quarter is the one that's home to all the city's Dark Elves.
"If it looks to you like an impoverished slum, that's because it is. Ulfric prefers that we live in squalor."
"He has nothing but disdain for anyone who isn't a Nord. He tolerates us, but that's the extent of his hospitality."
Not a day goes by that I don't think about returning to the ancestral home of my people.
"Still, even with the rough treatment we've had at the hands of Ulfric and his lot, I've got ties here."
"It's probably more trouble to pack up and leave than it is to stay. Besides, Ambarys can't run the cornerclub on his own."
"Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Solitude botanical gardens. Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are?"
"Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of the Emperor Pelagius III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane monarch."
"Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure. Or... you could use..."
"The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that coming, did you?"
"Pelagius Septim the Third, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him!"
"Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind..."
Let's make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage?
Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?
"Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh, happy times! I can't wait to..."
"Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?"
"And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing."
"You take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself in New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ta ta!"
Our daughter. Our little girl. She hadn't seen her tenth winter.
She was... he ripped her apart. Like a sabre cat tears a deer. We barely found enough of her to bury.
Sinding. Came through as a laborer. Seemed like a decent man.
"He's stewing in the pit while we figure out what to do with him, if you've got the stomach to look at him."
What could drive a man to do something like this?
This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations.
"Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it."
I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times.
Like... with the little girl.
I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway.
I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons.
"I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame."
That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control.
"Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever."
"Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore."
"Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you."
"I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin."
"Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell."
"I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do."
"When I saw the little girl, I was just... I could feel it coming on. I could taste the... I needed to hunt."
"But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud."
I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me.
She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then...
I... I feel terrible about what happened. About what I did. It would probably be best for everyone if I just went away.
At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.
Let me take a look at what you found.
"The Companions? In Jorrvaskr? They're recruiting new members, from what I hear."
It's too bad they executed Roggvir before we got here.
"They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready."
"Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say."
The Greybeards have summoned the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. Such a thing has not happened for... hundreds of years.
"There was a fight down in the Ratway, but reports are... sketchy. Some say it was Thalmor Agents, others say Thieves Guild. Some say it was both."
"Word is Elenwen's furious. Big party at the Thalmor Embassy, and one of the guests went someplace they shouldn't. Caused quite a commotion."
"Have you heard? There's been another dragon attack. Kynesgrove, this time."
What could it mean? The return of the Dragonborn? And who among us could possibly hold that honor? And such power?
"By the gods, it's true, isn't it? A dragon has attacked Whiterun. How could mere men bring down such a beast?"
"By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon."
There's been talk amongst the guards. That you are... Dragonborn. But such a thing... Surely that's not possible...
"The guards in Dragonsreach say you've aided the Jarl. On behalf of Whiterun, I thank you."
I've seen you helping the Jarl. If only all visitors to Whiterun were as noble.
"It was you convinced the Jarl to trap that dragon in the keep. And by Ysmir, it actually worked."
There's a dragon. Here. In Dragonsreach. And I thought it was just a name.
We had that beast contained. And you released it! Why? Why would you do such a thing?
"Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, man, why?"
"Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, woman, why?"
The Greybeards have arranged a truce between the Stormcloaks and Imperials. How long can such a thing last?
"The Greybeards have called a peace council, at High Hrothgar. And can you believe it - both Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius have agreed to go."
Word is spreading like magefire! The great evil has been vanquished! You have truly saved us all!
All hail the Dragonborn!
"In the ancient tongue, you are Dovahkiin - Dragonborn!"
You! You're the one who wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! All the guards are talking about it... You're a hero to us all!
"You hear the news? The Emperor has been murdered! Right here, in Skyrim. By the gods, if the Dark Brotherhood can do that, nobody's safe..."
By the gods. The Emperor's been murdered. On his own ship... moored in the inlet. It was... the Dark Brotherhood. There was nothing we could do...
"That old woman who runs the orphanage has been murdered. Say, didn't I see you coming out of there...?"
"Been a murder, over in Riften. Some old lady who runs an orphanage. Those poor children must be heartbroken."
"Hey! You're the one who killed Alain Dufont, up in Raldbthar. Oh yeah, word about that got around. Man was a piece of bandit trash, is what I hear."
"The Emperor's cousin, killed. Right here in Solitude. I feel nothing but shame..."
"The cousin of the Emperor was murdered! In Solitude, at her own damn wedding. Not a chance we would have let that happen here."
"You didn't hear this from me, but we've uncovered a plot to kill the Emperor! It gets better. The ringleader? One of the Emperor's own elite guard..."
"There was some ruckus over by that weird black door. You weren't involved in that craziness, were you?"
"Been lots of people coming and going through that creepy black door. And noises...  I'd say it sounds like construction, but that's crazy. Right?"
"There are some that say the Dark Brotherhood is back, and stronger than ever. That they've made Dawnstar their home. Tell me - am I wrong?"
The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Sir.
The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Ma'am.
"Wait, I know you. You went into the Emperor's Tower, just before... before his decoy was murdered..."
"We just received word that somebody tried to kill the Emperor! Turned out to just be his double, but can you imagine if he had succeeded?"
They're saying the Dark Brotherhood has been destroyed. Wiped off the face off Tamriel. But that's not entirely true... is it?
"You're the one all the guards are talking about. You went into that Sanctuary... wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! Friend, I owe you a drink."
"The city's changed, friend. The Thieves Guild is on the rise... and they've got a firm foothold here in Whiterun."
"Maybe you haven't heard, but the Thieves Guild is back. Windhelm is their city now, if you catch my meaning..."
"Markarth's a different place, now. Do business here, and you do business with the Thieves Guild."
"A change has swept into Solitude, like a breeze off the ocean - the Thieves Guild has come..."
"Ain't no doubt about it. The Thieves Guild is back, and they've got Riften in their grip."
"Welcome to Riften, home of the Thieves Guild. Or so they'd have you believe. It's all lies. They're just thugs... vermin, creeping around the Ratway."
The say the College has been snooping around Saarthal. Mages in a burial crypt. No good can come of that...
Some are saying the Psijic Monks have been seen in Skyrim. They're an ancient order. I had 'em figured for dead.
You hear the news? Those damn mages blew up Winterhold! Guess it was just a matter of time...
Word is the College of Mages is back to normal. If there's such a thing for that lot.
Your name's been cleared... by Thonar Silver-Blood. Consider yourself lucky.
So Madanach was behind those murders. Gods help us.
"By Shor, is that... is that Azura's Star? How did you come to possess such a rare treasure?"
Who did you have to kill to get that blade?
That is one... big hammer.
That mace... get it away from me. Get it away...
"Your shield... Dwarf-make, is it not? But yet it seems so much... more."
"That hammer... Why that's Aegisbane, heirloom of Clan Shatter-Shield! Last I heard, it was stolen by a couple of swindlers. Alain and... Muiri. Yeah."
What a foul and unnatural weapon you wield. Never have I seen its like.
Ugh. Your breath is foul. What've you been eating?
As if Skyrim didn't have enough outsiders. Now we've got mercenaries from Hammerfell struttin' about...
"From what I hear, you're the one gave the Thalmor a black eye. Sure know how to pick your enemies, don't you?"
"You've come to Dawnstar at a strange time, friend. Seems everyone in the town is having nightmares..."
The damned nightmares have finally stopped. Don't suppose you'd know anything about that?
"You've been seen in the company of the Companions. That's an honorable path you're on, friend."
"I know of your deeds, and am honored to address a member of the Companions."
Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like wet dog.
"Heard about what you did. Killing those foul witches. Well done, Companion."
"Kodlak killed, Jorrvaskr attacked. How could this happen, within the walls of Whiterun?"
"I heard about the attack on Jorrvaskr, and the killing of your honored leader. You have my sympathies, Companion."
"Kodlak White-Mane has been laid to rest, I know. May his soul live forever in the halls of Sovngarde."
You... you're the Harbinger. Of the Companions. It is my honor to stand before you.
"I hear the East Empire Company has reopened, thanks in no small part to you. Well done. All of Skyrim benefits from their trade."
You did this city a great service by catching that killer. Well done.
"Good thing you did for Nurelion, retrieving that phial for him before he died. Man was obsessed."
"By Ysmir, you've helped save the Gildergreen. Words can't express what that means to this city."
That sapling you recovered means the Gildergreen will live again. Your deed honors the people of Whiterun.
You've actually done it. You've found the Sybil of Dibella. You have done Markarth a tremendous service.
You... you were talking to that murderous savage. And then he escaped. What are you hiding?
First Torygg and now Elisif. Damn those Stormcloaks. Let's hope that Erikur fares better than they did.
"Filthy she-hound Elisif got what she deserved. Let her serve as [QUOTE]High Queen[QUOTE] of Oblivion, for all I care."
Solitude wouldn't be the same without the Fire Festival. City owes you a debt of gratitude.
"It's no secret the Aretino boy is doing some ritual, trying to call the Dark Brotherhood. But who's going to stop him? Me? I'll have no part of that."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!"
Go cast your fancy magic someplace else.
"Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn..."
"Guard might get nervous, a woman approaches with her weapon drawn..."
"Sheathe those claws, Khajiit..."
"You come up to me, fists raised? You looking for a beating?"
Releasing a captured dragon. I don't think I'll ever understand that one...
"Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word."
"Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?"
You have vanquished a great evil from Skyrim. You have saved this land... and our very souls.
"No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done."
"Looks like it's really happening. A peace council, attended by both Ulfric and Tullius, up on High Hrothgar. Maybe there's hope for Skyrim yet."
This truce with the Stormcloaks won't last a fortnight. Bloody savages will kill us while we sleep.
"A truce? With the Imperials? They'll murder us all, first chance they get."
I caught a glimpse of that captured dragon. It's.. beautiful. In its own way.
"Trapping a dragon in Dragonsreach. Damn clever idea you had, I have to admit."
"You have the Jarl's confidence, friend. And so you have mine."
You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend. Could you?
"If we killed a dragon once, we can do it again. With your help, of course."
"If those Whiterun guards can take down a dragon, so can we."
"Got to thinking, maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet."
For a dragon to attack Kynesgrove... Why? Why there? Is no place safe?
"If I'd been on guard at the Thalmor Embassy, wouldn't nobody be disturbing that party..."
"Thalmor in the Ratway? What's next, Spriggans in the Bee and Barb?"
"I have to wonder... what does the Dragonborn do once he's summoned by the Greybeards? Can the Thu'um be taught, like any skill?"
"You know, I could have gone into that Sanctuary. Killed all those Dark Brotherhood types. But I was... sick that day."
"Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?"
"I know who you are, assassin. I guess the rumors about your kind's [QUOTE]extinction[QUOTE] have been... exaggerated."
"So the Emperor had a decoy. Poor bastard got murdered, too. But then, I guess that was his job..."
"Now, I know who you are. And... and I know your business... Just, please... These are good folk we got here. Mostly..."
It ain't true what they say about you and... and the Dark Brotherhood? Is it?
"There are stories about you, and dark tidings in Dawnstar..."
Seems the Emperor's coming to Skyrim... and one of his own protectors was going to have him assassinated. Can't trust anyone these days.
"I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible..."
"I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible..."
"Look, that Vici woman had a bodyguard. I know it's terrible she got murdered at her own wedding, but the city guard is hardly to blame..."
"You ask me, those brats in the orphanage are better off, now that old Grelod is dead."
The Emperor's cousin Vittoria Vici is getting married soon. The reception will be public - anyone in Solitude can attend.
"The Emperor of Skyrim. Dead. These are dark times, my friend. Dark times, indeed..."
"We may guard Whiterun, but the Thieves Guild guards us. If you know what I mean."
Shirking the law in Windhelm ain't what it used to be. Not with the Thieves Guild running things...
"Break the law here in Markarth, and maybe we can work something out. Courtesy of the Thieves Guild."
"You know, the law here in Solitude can be a bit... [QUOTE]flexible.[QUOTE] So long as you've got the gold. That's the way the Thieves Guild likes it."
"Seeing as how Riften is home to the Thieves Guild, maybe we can work something out if you have trouble with the law. For the right price."
"The Thieves Guild used to run this city. Now they're nothing but braggarts and bullies, rotting to death down in their Ratway..."
"What business do College mages have in a place like Saarthal, anyway? It's a place for Nord dead... not your weird experiments."
"One of the guards said he saw a mage appear out of thin air. Claimed it was one of those Psijic Monks. Man's been hitting the skooma, I say."
"Imagine, blowing up an entire town. Damn College... Winterhold will never be the same."
You're that Mage from the College. Right? Hear things have finally calmed down over there.
You put those Forsworn down. Good job.
Gods damn those Forsworn. So many dead...
You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
"Wonder what it's like for those Thalmor, now that they've been taken down a notch..."
The people here are still plagued with nightmares. It's... unnatural.
No more nightmares. Thank the gods for that.
"Now I remember - you're that new member of the Companions. So you, what - fetch the mead?"
Honored Companion. How can I assist you?
Is that... fur? Coming out of your ears?
"I'm telling you, I heard it. Howling. Those werewolf tales are true."
I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.
"With respect, Companion, I'd ask that you and your friends muzzle that dog of yours. The howling coming from Jorrvaskr has gotten out of hand."
"If it isn't the slayer of the Glenmoril Witches. How can I assist you, Companion?"
"Who would dare attack the leader of the Companions? In his own hall? There'll be blood for this, I know it."
Kodlak White-Mane is in a better place now. For is there any place better than Sovngarde?
Thanks again for helping reopen the East Empire Company. Gonna have them import me some of that aged Breton cheese.
I was this close to catching that killer. I swear it.
"With Nurelion gone, I suppose Quintus has taken over business in the White Phial."
The Gildergreen blooms again. All thanks to you.
The Gildergreen will bloom again. All thanks to you.
Thanks for clearing out that vampire nest. You saved Morthal.
"Wonder what kinds of things they've got the Dibella doing, over in the temple. Mostly praying, I reckon..."
I know you had some part in Sinding's escape. Don't deny it...
"We'll protect Erikur as best we're able, but I fear the throne of Solitude is cursed."
It is whispered that one of the Daedric Princes himself is behind the murder of Elisif. It would seem even the nobility of Oblivion favors our cause.
"Watch the skies, traveler."
"Stay out of trouble, Argonian."
"What is it, Argonian?"
"Stay out of trouble, lizard."
"Staying out of trouble, kinsman?"
How can I help a brother Nord?
"Stay out of trouble, Nord."
"Don't cross me, Elf."
"Stay out of trouble, Elf."
"What is it, Elf?"
"Stay out of trouble, Khajiit."
"What is it, Khajiit?"
What do you want... cat?
"Stay out of trouble, Redguard."
"What is it, Redguard?"
"Stay out of trouble, Imperial."
"What is it, Imperial?"
"Stay out of trouble, Orc."
"What is it, Orc?"
"Hail, Companion."
You're that one from the College. Heard about you.
So you can cast a few spells. Am I supposed to be impressed?
Try to hide it all you want. I know you're in the Thieves Guild... and so do the other guards.
"Psst. Hey, I know who you are. Hail Sithis."
Ugh. That armor stinks of death. You been grave robbing?
"Ah, now that's a fine shield. And not mere Dwarven... is it?"
What manner of staff is that? Such a horror...
You wield... Azura's Star? How... how can such a thing be possible?
"Ah, Aegisbane. Sigil of Clan Shatter-Shield. But didn't that get stolen awhile back? Hmph. Must be rememberin' wrong."
"Fine armor you've got there. Dwarven make, am I right?"
"Ebony armor. By Ysmir, 'tis a wondrous sight."
"Is your armor made of... dragon bones? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that."
"Is your armor made of... dragon scales? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that."
"Some advice, friend. That armor won't offer much protection in a real fight."
You come talking to me wearing Imperial armor? You got stew for brains?
That's some fine Imperial armor you've got there.
"Judging by your armor, I'd say you're an Imperial scout. If so, well met."
"For your sake, I hope your took that armor from a dead Imperial scout..."
You wear the armor of a mercenary. Now that's the life.
"That's good armor you've got there, friend. Iron, solid and true."
"Hmph. You wear that armor well. Iron may be simple, but it'll stop enough to keep you in the fight."
"Fancy the leather armor, huh? Something to be said for going light."
That armor... it's like nothing I've ever seen. Like forged midnight...
"Orcish armor, hmm? Had me a set of that once. Ugly and strong, like those that forged it."
That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Can't say I envy you that job.
"That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Not very good at your job, are you?"
That's fine scale armor you've got on there. Shiny.
"Aye, now that's some fine armor. Good old-fashioned steel."
"Ah, steel plate. Now that's a solid choice of armor."
"What do you aim to do with that hammer, friend? Knock down a house?"
No.. get that accursed mace away from me...
"You wear the armor of the bear, my friend. A fine choice."
"You dare strut around here, wearing that filthy Stormcloak hide?"
That Stormcloak armor's getting on my nerves...
"You wear that Stormcloak armor well, friend."
You wear the armor of a brigand. Best not cause any trouble on my watch.
I know Thieves Guild armor when I see it. You're not fooling anyone.
You wear the garb of a true Nord. I salute you.
Pigsticker like that's not going to get you far. Best visit the blacksmith.
That iron sword's pretty undependable. You should try steel.
"Iron sword, huh? What are you killing, butterflies?"
"Aye, now that there's a beautiful sword. Like a sliver of midnight."
"Why the Elven blade, hmm? Nord steel not good enough for you?"
"Favor a steel sword, do ya? Good choice for slashing or stabbing."
I've a lot of respect for the Restoration School. Skyrim could use more healers.
Lightly armored means light on your feet. Smart.
"Hey, you mix potions, right? Can you brew me an ale?"
"Hands to yourself, sneak thief."
"I find your hand in my pocket, I'm going to cut it off."
"I know your kind, always sneaking about."
"Go fiddling with any locks around here, we're going to have a real problem."
"Fancy yourself an alchemist, hmm? Never could get the hang of that."
You're the one casts those illusions. Impressive.
Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers.
"Best offense is a good defense, am I right?"
Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.
Heard about you and your honeyed words...
"Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?"
"Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings."
Takes a fair bit of strength to carry a greatsword like that. But can you use it?
"Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer."
"Favor the bow, eh? I'm a sword man, myself."
"The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that."
"You're like me, eh? Don't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons."
No lollygaggin'.
"I heard the Gourmet is hiding out somewhere in Skyrim. You know, fella who wrote that cookbook."
We got a nickname for anyone who trifles with us guards here in Windhelm - [QUOTE]Suicide.[QUOTE]
Citizen.
I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.
"Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?"
Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
"You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark."
Let me guess - someone stole your sweetroll...
Could sure use a warm bed right about now...
I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead...
Just a few more hours and I can crawl under some furs...
"Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me."
Thinking of settling in? There's a house for sale - Breezehome. You should talk to the steward up in the keep if you're interested.
"You're that one lives in Breezehome, right? Fine place. Almost bought it myself."
"Hjerim is a fine house, and it's up for sale. You should talk to the steward in the keep if you're interested."
Don't think you'll get special treatment just because you have a house in the city...
"My heart goes out to Clan Shatter-Shield. Kin murdered, family warhammer stolen... There's no fairness in all that."
"Proudspire Manor, now there's a fine home. Up for sale, too. If you're interested, talk to the steward, in the keep."
"You own Proudspire Manor, hmm? Beautiful house. At least from the outside."
"If you're looking to settle in Riften, there's a house for sale - Honeyside. See the steward in the keep if you want it."
"Smart thing you did, buying Honeyside. Nice place, and why pay for an inn?"
"Ah, Vlindrel Hall's a fine home, if you can afford it. The steward in the keep can tell you more."
"So you bought Vlindrel Hall, eh? Wish I could afford a house that nice."
They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!
What is it? Dragons?
"My cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty."
Gotta keep my eyes open. Damned dragons could swoop down at any time.
I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
Everything all right?
Trouble?
"Staying safe, I hope?"
I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long since we've had a good bandit raid.
The Imperials think we need their laws. Pfft.
The Imperials think us all lawless beasts. I'm proof of their ignorance.
"Tis a wicked axe you wield there, friend. That blade looks sharp enough to cut through a god."
You're the one saved the Fire Festival. I remember.
"What do you need, bard?"
Is it?
Ha! I do love it when the mortals know they're being manipulated. Makes things infinitely more interesting.
Were you now?
By whom?
Wait! Don't tell me! I want to guess!
"Was it Molag? No, no... Little Tim, the toymaker's son? The ghost of King Lysandus? Or was it... Yes! Stanley, that talking grapefruit from Passwall."
"Wrong on all accounts, aren't I?"
"Ha! No matter! Honestly, I don't want to know. Why ruin the surprise?"
"But more to the point. Do you - tiny, puny, expendable little mortal - actually think you can convince me to leave?"
Because that's... crazy. You do realize who you're dealing with here?
"Oh, you just don't understand. Without him, I am not free! Without him, I am doomed! All of his empire shall fall into chaos..."
"He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry."
"But I hear the maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they can help for such an important matter?"
"Yes, yes, go. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens..."
"Yes, but don't try to use force! He's far too mighty. He'd crush you like a clay doll, or drop you from the sky, or simply eat your brain right up!"
"Oh, but he probably won't do those things to you. Probably. Just remind him to come home, and... there'll be no fighting or unpleasantness. Probably."
"He's just a little confused at the moment, is all. Knowing my master, he may very well reward you for bringing him to his senses!"
"Oh, no no no! No mistake at all. What you made was a choice. Granted, not a very wise choice, but these things happen. Ah, the folly of youth..."
"You know, you remind me of myself at a young age. All I cared about was riding narwhales and sleeping in honeycombs and drinking babies' tears..."
Word of advice if you ride a Narwhale. Mind the pointy end.
"Ah, but there I go, waxing poetic about my misspent youth. Now where were we? Ah yes. You're the mortal messenger. An I am...?"
Honestly. Have you any idea?
"Now that's the real question, isn't it? Because honestly, how much time off could a demented Daedra really need?"
So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to leave. That's right. I'm done. Holiday... complete. Time to return to the hum drum day-to-day.
On one condition.
You have to find the way out first. Good luck with that.
Wrong!
"Actually, you do. Sort of."
"I am a part of you, little mortal. I am a shadow in your subconscious, a blemish on your fragile little psyche. You know me. You just don't know it."
"Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. At your service."
Yaaawwwwnn....
"Oh, pardon me. Were you saying something? I do apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and irrevocably..."
Bored!
"I mean, really. Here you stand, before Sheogorath himself, Daedric Prince of Madness, and all you deem fit to do is... deliver a message? How sad."
Jolly good guess!
"But only half right. I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to myself every few thousand years."
Now you. You can call me Ann Marie.
But only if you're partial to being flayed alive and having an angry immortal skip rope with your entrails.
"If not... Then call me Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. Charmed."
So you're the one that burned down Goldenglow Estate.
Do you have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to cost me?
I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face here.
"So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive."
"You're a firebrand, aren't you?"
It's about time Brynjolf sent me someone with business sense. I was beginning to think he was running some sort of beggar's guild over there.
I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do.
"Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's Captain of the Guard and we're going to poison the mead."
What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?
"I warned you not to cross Maven. If I hadn't stepped in and paid amends, you'd be... well, I think you know."
At least Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side. He wants to meet with you right away.
And if I were you I'd hurry. I've never seen him this angry before.
You needed to know more?
You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.
You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.
"Why are you following me? I told you, I don't know anything else!"
"Look, I've told you everything. Now leave me alone!"
Our business has concluded and you're standing in my way.
"Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk."
No Firebrand Wine yet? How disappointing.
"Hmmm, you again. What is it this time?"
What did you need?
Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.
No time for idle chatter. Mercer is awaiting your presence.
"Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece!"
"Thank you. I'll look these over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant."
"[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting."
"Did you read it yourself? If I recall it correctly, that has some interesting implications. You should mention that to Tolfdir."
And... here. I suppose you've earned these.
My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind.
Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?
"Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return."
"Oh, but... I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any... inconveniences."
"Last I saw him, he was visiting a friend in the Blue Palace. But no one as mundane as the Jarl. No, no... such people are below him."
"No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea."
Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important. No entering Pelagius' Wing without that.
"He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can name him!"
"But... he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire."
But you will know him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!
"I'll make an exception for you, but do not bring anything out when you leave. Too many dark deeds transpired in those halls..."
"Well... I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly. Be careful, and come right back!"
If you really want to... Just be careful of the ghost! He snuck up on me once and scared me sick. It took a week for me to feel better...
How rude! Can't be bothered to host an old friend for a decade or two.
I have a saying - I'm not going to feel what you have to like. Or something like that.
Is it just me or is it getting saner and saner these days?
Pelagius stopped by and mentioned he hated you. Or I mentioned he hated you and he agreed.
"I hope you're having a good time. Actually, I hope I'm having a good time. I could care less about you."
I see you've been minding your own business. So how is the mind business?
Do you mind? I'm busy doing the fishstick. It's a very delicate state of mind!
"Please, take pity on an old madman!"
Who among you can help me?
"Wait, hear my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot bring him back!"
Why does everyone ignore me? Why do you turn your heads? Why will no one help me?
"The flame of my master burns low. Without him, we are all lost and forever gray... Please, help us!"
"More tea, Pelly my dear?"
"Oh, I couldn't. Goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things to do..."
"So many undesirables to contend with. Naysayers. Buffoons. Detractors. Why, my headsman hasn't slept in three days!"
"You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old?"
"You are the best Septim that's ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a dragon god, and that's hardly sporting..."
"Yes, yes, as you've said, countless times before..."
"Hafrumph! Well then, if you're going to be like that... Perhaps it's best I take my leave. A good day to you sir. I said good day!"
Reeaaaallllyyyy?
"Ooh, ooh, what kind of message? A song? A summons? Wait, I know! A death threat written on the back of an Argonian concubine! Those are my favorite."
"Well? Spit it out, mortal. I haven't got an eternity!"
Actually... I do. Little joke.
But seriously. What's the message?
You. You must take the Lexicon. Free me of my burden.
"Ah, at last! I hope you found the place all right."
"Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice."
"Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right?"
The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him.
"The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right?"
"The timid warrior and the sly Khajiit. Must have been one or the other, right?"
"Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice."
"Well, well. Aren't we the overachiever. Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances..."
"Remember, the Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Just beneath the road, and away from prying eyes."
What is the music of life?
Welcome home.
Move along.
A little girl is dead because of me.
"Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control."
"I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me."
It's all on account of this blasted ring.
"Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control."
"I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me."
It's all on account of this blasted ring.
"And I would deserve it, wouldn't I?"
I can't stop you if that's what you want to do. Hircine is too powerful.
"But if you spare me, I can be a powerful ally to you. And I would promise to never return to civilized life."
I know now that I can't live among people.
Thank the gods. Now let's deal with these other hunters. We hunt together!
"Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I might hurt."
"I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh?"
"Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway."
I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering.
"I think one of those volumes may have had some relevant information. If you want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn."
"He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him."
"When they left, he took off after them. Stole supplies and books from the College, I suppose as a way to ingratiate himself."
Let's just call it a [QUOTE]difference of opinion[QUOTE] with the College.
"They were interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College allows, so they were... persuaded to leave."

I beg your pardon?
No! Someone help me! Please!
"By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over!"
"Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!"
"I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!"
"I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to her! To the Listener!"
What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?
"It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!"
"Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's rambling?"
What?
So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just... the Night Mother's body?
"And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener... just spoke. Right now..."
...to you?
By Sithis.
And... what did she say?
Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is.
But Volunruud... that I have heard of. And I know where it is.
"Volunruud? Well, that is interesting. I know this place..."
Hmm?
"No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take your orders from me. Are we clear on that?"
"The Night Mother may have spoken to you, but I am still the leader of this Family. I will not have my authority so easily dismissed."
I... I need time to think about all this. Go see Nazir - do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter further.
But... What of Yamarz?
I see. He did not survive. He... He died well?
What? Why would he do such a thing?
"Ah, that is good to hear, then."
Yamarz was a coward and a weakling. His deceitful ways have cost you all greatly.
So he has been punished? And what of us? What fate shall we suffer?
"You'll have to prove yourselves, but I'm willing to give you a chance. Gularzob's in charge now. Let's hope he's a better chief."
"You, place that hammer on the shrine. You're the only one who's proven worthy in all of this..."
"You have done admirably, little one."
You have helped rid the Orcs of Yamarz in a way that avoids the destruction of their tribe.
They will become stronger for it. And you... You have proven your strength.
"You have earned my favor for now, mortal, and so I give you a little gift. Use it well."
"You! You'll help me! You help people, right? That's what you do?"
"Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it."
"Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left buried away."
"Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders."
"Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary in there!"
"Well, perhaps it's time for some independent study."
Check with Urag gro-Shub in the Arcanaeum. See if he's aware of any references to this... thing that you and Tolfdir found.
I'd like to know as much as we can about it.
How could you just leave me here?
"Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?"
I've got to get out of here.
Why did I ever come here?
Please! Help me!
Don't leave me here!
Urag can be very helpful. Just don't antagonize him.
"Well, you're certainly making a name for yourself."
I understand you're the one that found this... Orb in Saarthal.
You have what you came for. Now leave.
"Take your books and go, before I change my mind."
Do we have a deal?
This thing from Saarthal. What does it do? J'zargo cannot say.
I hear you found some... thing in Saarthal. You think it could help make me a powerful mage?
"We shouldn't have been disturbing Saarthal, no matter what you found down there."
At least something good came out of that trip to Saarthal. I didn't find anything but dust.
Welcome to the Midden.
Is it true? One of the Psijics was here in the College?
No one's heard from the Psijic Order in so many years. Hard to believe one would just suddenly show up here.
J'zargo regrets that there was no chance to speak with the Psijic Monk.
You must excuse me. I shouldn't be here.
It is good to meet you in person.
I hope you have good news for Mirabelle.
"Please, make sure Winterhold is safe!"
Well? Is everything out there all right?
"Find Savos, and get him back here if you can!"
What's happening? What did you people do?
You brought this on us! You!
"Please, whatever you did, just make it stop!"
What's going on out there? What happened?
Did you make something bad happen?
"I'm not seeing things again, am I?"
"Whatever it is you're up to at the College, you need to fix this at once!"
What have we gotten ourselves into now?
"Well, this certainly won't help our image."
This is not J'zargo's fault!
"By Azura, what's happening?"
"Shor's blood, what have they done?"
What's going on?!
This can't be happening!
The Arch-Mage is dead! Dead!
Protect yourself! We're under some kind of attack!
We've got to stay focused.
We never should have brought that thing here!
I hope this isn't something I did.
If this is somehow your fault...
By the gods... what was that?
We need to find out what Ancano's up to.
"I don't know what he's doing, but he won't get away with it."
I trust that you'll inform me as soon as the Staff is recovered.
I hope Mirabelle is helpful in locating the Staff.
So you're off to find some staff now? I don't see the point of that.
"J'zargo has heard of the Staff of Magnus. Once you are done with it, perhaps you will allow J'zargo to... Borrow it?"
"Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?"
"Please, tell me you've found the crystal. I've no wish to die in this place."
"Unless you can find that crystal, there's no point in wasting more time with talk."
It's very important you do this correctly.
"Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?"
"You got what you came for, didn't you? Go then, back to your college."
We've got to find a way to put a stop to this.
I hope whatever you're going to do will work.
"You'll defeat Ancano, won't you?"
What are we going to do? How do we save the College?
I hope you know what you're doing.
I can't lose all my research. There has to be a way to save the College.
You really think the Staff of Magnus is the key?
How long can we keep this up?
J'zargo knows that you will save the College. You must.
J'zargo is sure this is the end. And this was supposed to be a safe place...
"If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?"
"I've never seen anything like this, in all my years."
Can you imagine the kind of power behind this?
We never should have pulled that thing out of Saarthal.
Do you think Ancano knew all along what the Eye was capable of?
This is going to be terrible for business...
You're still alive!
"Get to the College, before it's too late!"
"What are you doing here? You need to get that Staff, or else we don't stand a chance!"
Our order will not forget your deeds.
You have done the world a great service.
Now what's going on?!
Psijics? Here now? What in Talos' name...
I knew you could do it!
We must hurry if we're going to defeat Ancano.
"Gods, you'd better have something good up your sleeve. I've got nothing left."
We never should have brought that thing here...
I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.
If only we'd stayed out of Saarthal.
I can't believe any of this is happening!
J'zargo is going to stay right here until this is all over.
If only Savos were alive to see this...
To Oblivion with the rest of them - save yourself!
Why doesn't someone do something?
I'm not ready to die. I'm just not...
So much energy... So much power. Never in my life have I seen something like this...
Azura's Star! I knew the Lady of Twilight had sent you for a reason.
Hand it over to me. I will ask Azura to restore the Star to its original purity.
Are you ready for me to show Azura her Star and receive her wisdom?
Azura is watching over you. She has seen this before it ever happened.
All will happen as it has been foretold.
The Twilight has foreseen all of this. Everything will be revealed in time.
I told you what you wanted to know. What else could you want?
I can send you into Azura's Star as soon as you're ready.
"Stop, outlander. You must pay for your crimes in blood or gold."
You've broken the Code of Malacath. Your choice - pay with your blood or your gold.
Huh. Okay. We'll test your mettle another day.
Typical outlander weakling. But your gold will strengthen our clan.
Then your poverty is my reward. Kill or be killed!
Today is a good day to die.
"Fight well, and I'll make sure your corpse is not dishonored."
"We haven't forgotten your crimes, outlander."
"Submit and pay bloodprice, criminal."
"Stop, outlander! You must pay bloodprice for your crimes."
"By the Code of Malacath, you must pay bloodprice for your crimes. Which will it be, blood or gold?"
Your crimes offend the Code of Malacath and we demand payment. Choose. Gold or blood.
"There are no jails in an Orc Stronghold, criminal. You must pay in gold or blood."
"All right, I'll go kill this giant."
"Unless, of course, you'd like to make some extra gold."
"I'm tired, I haven't slept well in weeks."
"You kill the giant, bring me the hammer. We go back to Largashbur, I tell everyone I did it."
"You keep your mouth shut, and I pay you. Handsomely."
"Fine, then wait here. This should only take a second."
Just stay out of my way.
Good. I'll be waiting right here.
Excellent work. You have a true fighting spirit. Did that better than I could have.
"Of course, I can't let you leave here alive. Wouldn't want anyone finding out."
Yamarz has fallen. It is now up to you to return the giant's hammer to Atub.
"The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right."
"Yamarz has revealed himself as a coward and a schemer, and has earned the fate of all who follow that path."
"The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right."
"Take the giant's hammer to Atub, and tell her what has happened here."
Hey! Hands off!
"Hey, that isn't yours!"
I saw you steal that!
How dare you!
Why you little filcher...
Get your thieving hands off that!
You won't get away with that!
You can't take that!
"Put that down, you mangy cat!"
"By Ysmir, a thief!"
You thieving little elf!
"You dirty, filching lizard!"
"What are you doing, s'wit?"
Think you can steal from me?
Oh no you don't!
You little thief!
Why you...
You're not getting anything from me!
"Nice try, fat-fingers!"
You dare try and steal from me?
"Get back, thief!"
Filthy pickpocket!
Pickpocket! We've got a pickpocket!
"You little wretch, I saw that!"
The Stormcloaks pay blood for blood!
You dare dishonor the Legion?
Fool! The Imperial Legion will have your blood!
Bad idea.
Help! Someone's being attacked!
Someone do something!
Help! I'm being attacked!
"Help me, help me!"
Last mistake.
Help! Murder!
What the...?!
Someone do something!
"Help, someone!"
Murdered! In cold blood!
Ysmir's beard!
"By the gods, no!"
"By the gods, did that really just happen?!"
Murder! Murder!
"Help! Somebody, help!"
Leave that dog alone!
"Hey, that's a valuable animal!"
That's it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
That's it. I'm placing you under arrest.
"This is your last warning. Get away from there, or else."
"This is your last warning. Get out, or get arrested."
You're trespassing here. You'd better clear out.
You should have listened. Guards! Help! Trespasser!
Guards! Trespasser!
"I'm not going to warn you again. Get out, or I'll call the guards!"
"Last warning. Leave, now."
This is the last time I'll say it. Get out.
"It's time for you to leave, my friend."
"You, of all people. Get out!"
You're not supposed to be here...
Can't a man have a bit of privacy? Get out of here!
Can't a woman get a moment to herself? Leave me!
That's close enough.
I'm warning you. Back off!
Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.
I knew I could count on you.
Good. Don't die out there.
We all have faith in you.
Go with the Nine.
Talos keep you.
Don't screw this up.
"Good. And remember - keep the gods, and they'll keep you."
Excellent. Put the fear of the Nine into those motherless dogs.
That's what I wanted to hear. Good luck out there.
"I knew I could count on you, soldier."
Good luck out there.
We do this for the good of Skyrim and her people. Never forget that.
Make me proud.
May the gods keep you.
Stay sharp out there.
"Good. Make it it happen, soldier."
Show the rebels the futility of their cause.
"As long as the rebels are willing to die fighting the Empire, we must be willing to oblige them."
"Peace may yet return to Skyrim. But until then, we fight."
Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.
"I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than fight for the people of Skyrim?"
"Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?"
What do you say? Can you do this?
"This won't be easy, but that's why I'm sending you. Think you can handle it?"
This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?
"You gave those mongrels a real whipping, eh? Good work. We'll be sure to send a garrison to reinforce the area and keep the peace."
"Excellent! We've hit 'em where it hurts. Repairs will be needed when we take over, but at least the Stormcloaks won't benefit in the meantime."
"We hit 'em where it hurts. As soon as we can, we'll take over - make the needed repairs. In the meantime, the people no longer slave for the Empire."
"Well done, indeed. This will be of great service. Understanding the enemy's position makes us all the more equipped to usurp it."
"And with the rebels thinking us occupied elsewhere for the time being, we'll be able to take them by surprise."
Good work. Knowing more about the enemy's position makes it that much easier to take it from him.
"And of course, they'll be caught off guard thinking we're off doing something altogether different."

The rebels are keeping some of our men prisoner there. I aim to turn that into an advantage.
"I've sent men to scout out the area. You are to meet them, find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort."
They won't be expecting an attack from the inside.
"They have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage."
"I've sent some men to scout out the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort."
They'll never suspect an attack from the inside.
"Go in quiet, break our man out, then get out of there. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell."
"Go quiet, break him out, then run. This isn't a suicide mission. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell."
"You made it! I'm impressed. It was a gamble, but turned out well."
"You're alive! It was a gamble - but as Talos keeps us, we keep each other - I wasn't going to just let them rot in there."

"What the rebels like to forget, is that the Empire's what's keeping the Dominion out of Skyrim."
Can't wait to kill another of Ulfric's boys.
Damn faithless Imperials.
Next Imperial I see is dead.
We'll show those faithless dogs who this land belongs to.
Stay sharp.
Keep your guard up.
Keep an eye out for trouble. It's only a matter of time.
Keep your eyes open.
Fight or die well.
Talos guide you.
The waiting... the insufferable waiting.
Can't wait to gut one of those rebels.
Soon. I can almost taste it.
Well? Where the hell are those damned Stormcloaks? Let's get this over with already.
"If those rebels think they can best us, they have another think coming."
"By the Nine, I hate the waiting. The goddamned waiting."
Can't wait to kill another Imperial.
Gah. Let's do this already. I'm itching to kill something.
What's taking them so long? Did they get lost? Let's get this over with already.
Can't wait to see the look on their faces when they find us here waiting to spill their blood.

Good job out there. Glad you were with us.
Thanks. Couldn't have done that without you.

Citizen. I'm warning you. Your presence is interfering with Imperial business. Be gone!

Be gone!
Citizen. You have been warned. You leave me no choice but to resort to violence.

Good to hear.
I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun.
"You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there..."
Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...
"These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make things better, eh?"
I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun.
"You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there..."
Do the men you killed haunt you? Mine do...
"Straight to business with you, huh?"
"Well, it just so happens I have the perfect mission for you."
I suppose you're right... they say it gets easier...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing...
But never mind all that. We've got a job to do.
That's what I keep telling myself.
"But, never mind all that. We've got a job to do. Don't we?"
"I remember you... you were with us at Helgen, and Whiterun. Glad to have you with us. How are you?"
I suppose you're right... they say it gets easier...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing...
But never mind all that. What brings you out this way?
That's what I keep telling myself.
"But, never mind all that. What brings you out this way?"
Hello friend.
Glad you're here.
You're still alive?
Huh. I had heard you died.
I have to admit. This is more fun that I thought it'd be.
"I can't remember the last time I visited home. Think I've forgotten what a proper bed looks like, let alone feels like."
Who do you think's killed more Imperials? You? Or me?
Have you always been that ugly?
"I've heard some things about Ulfric I don't like, but he's right about this war and about Skyrim's future."
I don't think Galmar even knows my name. Probably because I'm not [QUOTE]The Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Imperials and join forces for just a little while take care of some of these dragons?
Who do you think killed more rebels? You? Or me?
[QUOTE]Dragonborn[QUOTE] huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?
"Ever get the impression Rikke's not always sure what side she's on? I'm not doubting her loyalty. Just, she seems rather sympathetic to the rebels."
I don't think Rikke even knows my name. Probably because I'm not [QUOTE]The Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
"Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Stormcloaks, join forces for just a little while, and take care of some of these dragons?"
Focus on the mission.
What? Now's not the time to chat.
This should be fun.
I wonder how many of us think we'll be the lucky ones and survive this?
"So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What is that?"
"Pleasant weather for a war, no?"
Gah! Let's get on with it already!
You made it? I was sure I'd find you face down in the dirt.
I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.
That was fun.
"That went pretty well, all things considered."
"Do colors seem brighter to you? Everything seems bigger, too. Strange..."
Are your ears still ringing? I hope that goes away.
Get over to the capital! We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Markarth. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Morthal. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Falkreath. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Whiterun. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Dawnstar. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Winterhold. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Riften. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Windhelm. We're mounting our final attack!
Get down to the front line.
Get down there and join Rikke on the front line.
Get down there and join Galmar on the front line.
I'll meet you there.
We're not quite ready to muster the final attack.
I need you to create some chaos in the hold so I can maneuver men into position without drawing too much attention.
I need you to create some chaos in the hold.
"Search out enemy soldiers in the wilderness, or guarding towns and settlements, and kill them."
"Find enemy controlled resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, and sabotage them."
"And take out resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, with a little sabotage."
And sabotage enemy controlled resources.
"If you run across any enemy couriers, take them down, and bring me whatever they're carrying."
Good work!
Good job!
Excellent. These should come in handy.
I would hate to think what would happen if this fell into enemy hands.
Here. Take this for your trouble.
So why'd you join up with the Legion?
How'd you end up here?
What are your thoughts on all this?
"My father was a Legionnaire, and his before him. I guess I never considered doing anything else."
"I signed on 'cause I couldn't watch the Stormcloaks tearing everything apart and not do something. But, most of my family disagrees with my choice."
"I know it's what everyone says, [QUOTE]To go to new places and see the world.[QUOTE] But it's true in my case... I never bargained on seeing more than I liked."
"So, why'd you join the Stormcloaks?"
What are your thoughts on all this?
So what's your story?
My cousin disappeared one night. Some say the Thalmor grabbed him. It wasn't long before I found myself under Ulfric's banner.
I don't want some snotty elf telling me what gods I can and can't worship.
I'm a true Nord. Simple as that.
"Yes, from what I've heard I expect Tolfdir will be occupied for some time. Hmm, that is a problem, isn't it?"
I suppose someone else will need to look after the Apprentices for now.
"You're the one who conspired with the Forsworn against Markarth! You're coming with me, murderer!"
There's no mistake. You're a wanted man... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
There's no mistake. You're a wanted woman... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
"The only mistake was you showing your face. You've committed crimes against Skyrim and her people, and it's time to face the Jarl's justice."
"Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here."
You think Alva...but that means...
Ye gods! You think Alva is a vampire?
Please excuse the mess.
"If you get me the logbook, I'll have proof of Shatter-Shield's treachery."
Let me know when you've learned more about the pirates.
She's probably the one you ought to talk to.
Give those pirates what for!
We're so grateful for your help.
What're you looking at?
I know this place looks horrible -- please don't hold it against the Company.
A very powerful family in Windhelm.
"They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves."
"Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow."
"Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that."
They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron.
"She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes."
"If it were to somehow end up in my hands, I wouldn't argue."
We used to think the pirates had an army of battlemages at their side.
"As it turns out, it was just one. Haldyn. I've since learned more about him."
"The most dangerous sort of man -- quick to anger, but patient in exacting vengeance."
He also has a fearsome control of Destruction magic.
I wish you the best of luck.
"Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim."
"Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too - the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days."
"In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power."
It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do.
The old tales tell of Dragonborn heroes who slew dragons and took their power.
It seems those tales are true.
"With the dragons returning, and now a Dragonborn appearing... maybe the Greybeards know what it all means."
"It means you can kill dragons and steal their power - even speak with a dragon's voice, they say."
"There hasn't been a Dragonborn seen in the land for centuries. Not since Talos himself walked the 7,000 Steps to High Hrothgar."
I don't know much. Only the old tales about the ancient heroes who would use the Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
"They say the Emperors used to be Dragonborn, but that all ended when Martin died during the Oblivion Crisis."
The Greybeards can tell you much more than I can. They're the masters of the Way of the Voice and taught Tiber Septim himself.
"The only thing I remember is the old story of Tiber Septim being called Dragonborn by the Nords, before they switched sides and joined the Empire."
No doubt those Greybeards up at High Hrothgar will talk your ear off about it.
"They live in seclusion on the slopes of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim."
"They're masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they're the ones who can teach you how to use your power."
"Near as I can tell, a bunch of ancient Nord hermits who live on top of a mountain."
"Never heard of them talking to anybody before. If they really do want to talk to you, you'd better go find out what they want. You never know."
They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting. They live up on top of the Throat of the World.
"If you're really Dragonborn, they'll want to talk to you. In the old stories, they always summon the Dragonborn for training."
"Ulfric can tell you more than most anyone. He was studying to be a Greybeard himself, back before the Great War."
"In the old tales, Nord heroes would use the power of their Voice to Shout down the gates of cities and strike down their enemies."
But only the Greybeards study the Way of the Voice any more. If you can Shout... you need to talk to them.
Old Nord folk tales always talk about Shouting their enemies to pieces. I always thought it was just a myth.
"If you think you might be able to do that kind of thing, the Legion could certainly use your help."
"Go talk to the Greybeards, see what they can tell you."
"Well, I only know what I've heard in the old tales. Shouting is an ancient form of magic - the use of one's voice to project their power."
"If you can Shout, you need to go see the Greybeards. They'll know what to do."
I know more than most. I trained with the Greybeards at High Hrothgar when I was a boy.
"The Way of the Voice is an ancient, spiritual form of magic in which you project your vital essence into a [QUOTE]thu'um[QUOTE] or Shout."
Most people would need to train for years before they could even attempt a single Shout.
"The Dragonborn is different - you have an inborn ability to Shout, the same way dragons are said to."

All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else.
"Here, take your gold and leave me in peace."
"Not Lady Dibella? No, please! I can't lose her!"
"I get the message. Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!"
It... it worked. Mara be praised!
You vanished after drinking the Torpor and materialized on the other side. I have never seen anything quite like it.
How I envy you. I can only imagine the excitement of seeing history through the eyes of another!
"Sadly, I am resigned to just reading of its wonders through my research of the Skull."
"After what you just experienced, you are not amazed? I am at a loss for words."
I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within the Dreamstride.
"However, this hardly matters any longer as you appear to have exited unscathed."
My wife died. Things won't be the same without her.
My husband died. Things won't be the same without him.

Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have no more trouble from me.
"You found me! Laelette was trying to find me too, but I'm glad you found me first."
"Laelette was told to burn mommy and me, but she didn't want to."
She wanted to play with me forever and ever.
"She kissed me on the neck, and I got so cold that the fire didn't even hurt."
"Laelette thought she could take me and keep me, but she can't. I'm all burned up."
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for a while now.
Now there's a mystery.
"She ran away when the war started. Her husband, Thonnir, was devastated. No note or nothin'."
I'm pretty sure she up and joined the Stormcloaks.
Laelette? I thought she left to join the Stormcloaks. Ah! My poor Laelette!
I thought Laelette left to join the war. I hadn't heard from her since she left.
"She began to spend a lot of time with Alva. Yet just a week before, she despised her."
"In fact, the night she disappeared, she was supposed to meet Alva."
Alva told me later that she never showed up. I never got to tell her good bye.
"Speak with Ulfric, he's expecting word from Whiterun."
The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!
We're taking the city. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We're attacking Riften. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We're mounting our final attack on Windhelm. You're needed on the front line. Get a move on soldier!
We're taking the capital. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We're taking Dawnstar. Get down there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
We're taking Winterhold. Get over there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!
We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's cousin is getting married! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's visiting! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We're taking Whiterun. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We're mounting our attack on Markarth. Get over there and join the brothers gathering for the attack. This is it now! Talos be with you.
We're mounting our final attack on Solitude. Get over there and join the rest of the army. They'll be launching the attack soon. Talos be with you!
We're taking the capital. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We're taking Falkreath. Get over there with the others. Fight well or die well.
We're liberating Morthal. Join the brothers gathering for the attack. Talos be with you.
The Imperials are here. All lined up pretty-like in their shiny armor. We'll put a few dents in those bastards before we give up the city. Move it!
"Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family. And, we've always welcomed those... shunned by society."
"Werewolves, wizards, eternal ten year-old vampires... what does it matter? In truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked."
"Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways... simply are not our ways."
He just couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.
"Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim. It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years."
"If you say Cicero has gone there, it stands to reason that he's familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own ground."
Tread carefully.
Should have figured Astrid would send you.
Do me a favor and kill that little jester twice. Just to make sure.
What gave it away?
Ha ha ha ha ha.
"Yeah, got to admit that little jester is good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as good as I got."
"In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it. I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase."
"All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'd be much good to you, anyway. The little fop cut me pretty deep."
But I slashed him good. Pretty sure I severed an artery. Don't know what you're going to find in there... but you can probably just follow the blood.
Kill me if you must. But I can't promise I won't haunt you till the end of your days if... if the Dread Lord lets me. Ha ha ha ha ha.
Good hunting. I'll see you back at the Sanctuary.
"Gee, thanks for the help."
"Kill me or don't, Listener! The power is yours! But spare poor Cicero, and a friend you will have! Oh, such a friend, until we enter the Void..."
"Oh, we have unfinished business you and I."
What do you think? Are we going to let Ulfric dictate terms to us before the negotiations even start?
What do you think? I can't let Ulfric dictate terms to me before the negotiations even start.
"By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh?"
To think that we would sit down with that... Thalmor bitch. I say she walks or we walk.
"By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh?"
To think that I would sit down at the same table with that... Thalmor bitch. Either she walks or I do.
This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while.
Places where you can overhear things. See things.
And the Whispering Lady.
I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do.
That he worries about being chased from Whiterun.
That he... that I'm...  that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister.
She won't tell me her name.
"I've gotten good at listening to keyholes. At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me."
"I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets."
But I can't open the door.
"In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it."
"I bet she'll talk to you, too."
"Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly."
But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore.
"I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers."
"I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal."
"The boy was good at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role."
"First, you must open this door."
"A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals."
I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself.
"Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel better, shortly."
"Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid."
"Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!"
"I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you..."
"Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?"
"Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you."
"She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just... just rest."
"Look, we've got to deal with this situation. You've got to deal with this situation."
I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life!
But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right.
"After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild."
Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
"Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down."
You must be the one Falk spoke so highly of. Welcome.
You've returned! I'm hoping successfully.
You know what needs to be done. Is there something more you need?
The courier must have found you.
Speak to Styrr. He can help.
I won't be able to relax until I'm sure Potema is dealt with.
"Sure is. I've got another client -- wants me to do some enchanting. You can do the pick-up for me, if you want."
"There's more enchanting to be done. You can acquire whatever it is and bring it back here, and I'll take care of it."
"All right. Be quick about it, will you? This is a good way for the College to bring in some money."
Here's the name and location of the client.
"Yes, yes I did. I've already sent instructions, you just need to make sure this arrives in one piece."
"Ah, you're from the College? I've been waiting for you."
Please make sure this arrives in a timely manner. And don't scratch it up.
"Oh, good. I've been waiting for you. Here you go, it's all ready."
"Now, Sergius knows what I want. I'm hoping he can get it done quickly."
"It's about time someone arrived. Here, make sure this is handled properly."
"Oh yes, that. Here you go. I hope this can be ready soon."
"Yes, yes. Let's keep our voices down, all right? Just make sure this gets there."
I need some more supplies. Can you help out with that?
I'm running low on Petty Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Lesser Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Common Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Greater Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Grand Soul Gems.
"If you can bring me three more, that would be helpful."
"I need at least five more, if you can find them."
"Bring me another seven of them, if you can."
Ten more would keep me stocked for a bit.
"In fact, there is. I need a soul gem filled, if you're up to it."
"Here, take this Grand Soul Gem, fill it for me, and bring it right back. I'll be waiting."
"Some other time? That's not going to help me much, now is it?"
"Ah, yes. Thank you. I'll get to work on this right away."
I'll add it to the list of things I need to take care of. Thank you.
"Excellent. Thank you, I'll see that this gets put to good use."
"Yes, a Grand one. Soon, please."
"If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous locations."
There are more books to be recovered and secured here in the Arcanaeum.
"Well all right. Here, I scribbled down the last place I'd heard about. Check it out, but be careful."
"Ah. Some other time, perhaps?"
"I had to use your pay to smooth things over with the client. They didn't want to be associated with a criminal. Next time, don't get arrested."
"Gettin' pinched and endin' up in jail doesn't cut it with our clients. If you want to get paid next time, stay clean."
"Yeah, your right. Probably a waste of your time anyway."
"Sure, no problem. We'll find someone else to do it."
Don't even give it a second thought. Maybe next time.
Your not winnin' points with me with that attitude.
"When you find your nerves, then we'll talk."
"Fine, but you're not gettin' any wealthier by weaslin' out of everythin' I offer you."
You're not going to get richer with that attitude.
You need to bloody well get your priorities straight if you want to make it around here.
"Too bad, looks like I need to find someone else to take care of business."
"If you think you'll make your fortune kickin' around the Flagon all day, that's where your wrong."
And here I thought you were a master criminal. Guess I was wrong.
"All-righty. Good luck out there, boss."
"Here you go, boss. All the details."
"Great. Watch yourself out there, boss."
Good... here's your assignment.
"Finally, someone with backbone. Here you go."
Now that's what I like to hear. Off you go.
"Nice. Here, this is what you'll need to know."
Keep this up and you'll be rich enough retire before you know it. Good luck.
Just remember the rules... keep it clean and keep it quiet. Here's the details.
"Here's everythin' you need. You get caught, and we've never heard of you."
Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine. Let me give you the details.
"A pleasure as always, boss. Here's your payment."
"Got all your gold ready, boss. You can count every coin, it's all there."
"I hardly noticed you were gone. Got your share of the spoils right here, boss."
Good job. Now here's your part of the deal.
Here's your share. Well done.
Nicely done. Here's your share.
And here's the spoils. Plenty more where this came from!
"I can pat you on the back all day, but coin's coin, right?"
This kind of work suits you... and is going to end up makin' you rich.
Couldn't have done it better myself. Here's your coin.
"If you don't watch it, I may actually start to respect you. Job well done."
"Sorry, boss. Had to use your share to cover expenses after you done and got messy."
"I'm afraid I had to pay off a few officials to keep you out of jail, boss. Expensive to get murder off the books, know what I mean?"
"Now don't get cross with me, but the officials are demanding compensation for the mark you killed. Had to do it... had no choice, boss."
"What's the matter with you? We said keep it clean! Well, you can just forget about your payment."
"Sure you finished, but you killed someone to do it. Next time listen to the rules if you want to get paid."
"You needed to do this clean and quiet, and you failed. Now we need to use your payment to cover your mistake."
"I hope you weren't expectin' to get paid for this blundered job. Next time, the mark stays alive... you hear me?"
"This ain't the Dark Brotherhood. Next time, you keep the job clean and you'll get your coin."
"Consider it forgotten, boss."
"Are you bloody serious? You're not going to get ahead by quitting around here, that I can promise you."
You can't keep quittin' jobs when it strikes your fancy. You're going to make us all look like a bunch of amateurs. Think next time.
Keep droppin' these jobs and I might quit assignin' them to you.
"Being connected to a criminal didn't make the client happy... next time, act like a real thief and don't get caught."
Good going... you got arrested. Now how do you think that looks for the Guild? Better luck next time.
Good. Here's what you need to do.
Suit yourself. You're the boss.
"All right, whatever you want."
"No problem, I'll find someone else. Don't worry about it."
"Hey, you approached me. You want to play coward, that's your problem."
"Look, I don't like wasting my time. Come back when you decide to get serious."
Not interested? Fine. Then let me offer it to someone with a little more backbone.
"You need to start pulling your own weight around here, otherwise I might [QUOTE]forget[QUOTE] to offer you any more jobs."
Fine. I'll just keep all this coin for myself then.
"Look, if you just want to sit around the Flagon all day getting drunk, that's your business. Just quit wasting my time."
"The last time I checked, gold coins aren't falling from the heavens. You better take some jobs if you want to earn your share."
Keep turning down jobs like this and the Guild will begin to lose respect for you.
Fine. Here's everything you need to know.
All right. Take this and get out of here.
Fine. Just keep it clean. Here you go.
"Good, just remember the order: do job first, get drunk second. Now take this and go."
Here you go. Hope you don't muck it up.
Here. Just don't make me look like an ass in front of the Guild and mess it up.
"Whatever, just get it done. Here's the job."
"Oh, you're back? I suppose you'll be wanting your pay then."
You did the job and you did it clean; that's all we ever ask. Enjoy the gold.
Didn't muck it up I hear. Good. Here's your share.
I suppose you want your share now? Here you go.
"And with no strings attached. Not bad. Here, got some coin for you."
"Amazing what people leave laying around for us to take, isn't it?"
Fine. I guess you'll need your coin then.
Here's your gold. Try not to spend it all in one place.
"I want to pay you, but I had to cover up the murder. Didn't expect you to go on a killing spree."
"Sorry, I don't have a single septim left after paying the town guard to keep quiet about the mark you killed."
"Look, I told the client you probably had a good reason to kill the mark, but well, they demanded reparations."
"Are you out of your mind? We said no bloodshed! Well, guess what. You can just forget about your gold."
I thought it was crystal clear... no one dies on these jobs. Remember that next time you want to get paid.
"You an assassin or a thief? Next time, keep your blade sheathed if you want to make any gold."
"You drew blood, so you aren't getting paid. That's the rules. You don't like it, take it up with Brynjolf."
You idiot! We have to cover your mess up and that costs us gold... which means you don't get any.
"No problem, I'll get someone else to take it."
"Fine. Next time, save me the trouble and pass on it from the beginning."
"Make up your mind, will you? You're starting to make us look bad."
"First you take the job, now you don't even want it. I wish you'd make up your mind."
"You've done a great thing, today. It doesn't matter who you support in the war; Potema would have been a blight on the land for both sides."
Without you this would have been a disaster. I should have paid more heed to Varnius' warnings.  I won't make that mistake again.
Ready to get moving?
"So, what's the plan?"
We heading out?
Whenever you're ready to leave.
You're ready to get going?
Shall we get moving?
We going?
Ready to get going?
"You are ready to move, yes?"
We are leaving?
Waiting.
Still standing here.
Mara protect us both.
I'm itching for a fight.
I'm right behind you.
Still here.
I've got your back.
Lead on. I'm behind you.
"To Oblivion and back, as they say."
"Ours is to follow, friend."
Khajiit guards your back.
"If anyone sneaks up on us, I'll smell them coming. Or I might not. We'll see."
"You're taking us somewhere warm, I trust?"
An Orc follows to the death.
My blood's calm. I prefer it boiling.
You have a grim look.
We've stopped. What is it?
I'm still here.
Let's get going.
No! Not again! I shall not be denied again!
Potema herself? Please tell me you stopped them.
"Any resident of Solitude can tell you, she was the deadliest person ever to come out of Skyrim."
"Queen of Solitude, granddaughter of Emperor Uriel Septim II, five hundred years ago. Her fight for succession nearly tore the empire apart."
"After twenty years of fighting, she had raised armies of the dead, led by vampire generals. If she returns to power, nobody could stop her."
"A curious figure. Unrepentantly evil and nasty, of course, but also astonishingly brilliant, and obviously quite a necromancer at her end."
"She was always so close to being Empress, but despite her machinations, it was never to be hers."
"Ironically, if she were alive today, she'd be the only living member of the Septim bloodline. By all rights, she would now be Empress."
You think this is personal?
The Empire has no place in Skyrim... not any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.
Don't worry. We'll take good care of your city when you're gone.
"When Ulfric Stormcloak becomes High King, Skyrim will finally be the way my ancestors intended. It's a new day in Markarth."
"You never were able to see the forest for the trees, were you?"
How kind of you. And I've brought an army to give you a going away parade.
"A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what then?"
"We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people should know that."
We Nords were proud warriors once. And we still could be. Evidenced by the men and women who fought and died bravely today.
You could see that if you had any faith left in that black heart of yours.
"But no, you're content to snatch scraps falling off the Emperor's table. Fine. Take my home. Take my city. May it burn down around you."
"If this was my Empire, I'd be able to worship whoever I damned well pleased. You wish to see an Empire without Talos? Without its soul?"
"We should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor."
"Skyrim needs a High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will do the same."
"A bit melodramatic, even for you Laila."
Pack your things and go.
"Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it?"
How many of those corpses lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend? What about their families?
"One day when you can see past your own interests, you will come to see that we were right."
And this... This is all wrong.
Enough! That's enough. I surrender... I surrender.
Peace! Everyone stand down. That's an order. Stand down!
"Yield. I yield, Stormcloak! The city of Markarth is yours."
Stop! Enough! Stand down!
The city is yours.
It's over! Everyone stop!
I surrender... I surrender...
"A likely story. They won't even do their own dirty work now, eh? Well, you won't get the better of me!"
Now tell me where my brother is!
No? So you don't know anything about my brother?
Then what are you doing here?
"Thorald... Thorald Gray-Mane? Fighting for the Stormcloaks, disappeared and believed dead?"
"You really don't know anything about this, do you?"
"Because they've got Thorald locked away somewhere, and if they find me here I'll disappear too!"
I am not going to let that happen!
I can't do this all on my own. Are you... are you offering to help me?
"What's there to say? You go against the Empire, you wind up dead. Thorald got what was coming to him."
Best not to ask too many questions about it. People might get the wrong idea about you.
"Between the two of us, his family is better off thinking he's dead."
"Thorald and I have history, all right? We used to be friends. So I looked into it when he disappeared."
I found out the Thalmor have him. And they don't let anyone go.
"So I've kept my mouth shut. Like I said, his family is better off believing he's gone, because he's never coming back."
"He fought on the wrong side, and he paid for it. That's all I have to say."
"Oh come on, leave it alone. He's gone. There's no use in talking about it anymore."
I wish everyone could just get past that and get on with their lives.
"It's been a while now. I miss him, but it's clear he's not coming back."
He knew what he was getting into. I don't... I don't blame anyone.
"I used some contacts in the Legion, asked some questions. Was told I should mind my own business."
"Last I'd heard, he'd been carted off to Northwatch Keep. Ever heard of it?"
"If you go in there, you don't come out. Ever."
"Here, see for yourself. This is the last word I received. I'm telling you, he's gone for good."
You what?
"Oh no. No, no, no. This can't be happening."
"Please, you can't tell anyone. It must remain a secret! I'll do whatever you want."
What makes you think I know anything? Everyone knows he's dead and gone!
"Okay, okay!"
"All I know is that Idolaf made some effort to find out what happened to him, but was told to stop asking questions."
He got some letter from the Legion and has left it alone since then.
"I'll prove it to you, all right? I'll get you the letter. Just... meet me at the statue of Talos, and don't tell anyone about this."
That's privileged information. Now move along.
Unngh...  Uhhh...
Thorald? Thorald!
Brother? Is... Is that you?
I'm here! I knew I'd find you!
What in the world?
"There's no time. We've got to get you out of here! Come on, let's go!"
"I'll round up what men I can, and meet you outside Northwatch Keep. We'll get in and out as fast as possible."
I'll see you there.

"Well, well. I was looking for this little beauty."
"If you happen across any other unusual trinkets like this, be sure and bring them to me. I promise it'll be worth the effort."
Here you go. This should cover it.
I think you'll find this payment to be more than fair.
Really? And what might that be?
"I'm sorry, what?"
"Well... I'd certainly love to have such a powerful staff, but I'm not really sure that any of us need it."
And how do you know this?
Did you really?
And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus?
"I... I'm impressed with your initiative. Of course, someone will need to follow up on this."
Something as specific and ancient as the Staff of Magnus... I'm not sure we'd ever find something like that...
I seem to recall Mirabelle mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can tell you anything?
"I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know. You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well done."
This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use to you now.
"A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for yourself."
I certainly do.
"Since you went so far as seek out the Augur for advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic."
Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be asking?
"I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure what he expects me to tell you."
I only brought it to his attention a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it.
They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a closet somewhere.
The [QUOTE]Eye of Magnus[QUOTE]?
"I can appreciate that this... thing, this Orb... It's very impressive. Very unique, and definitely worth studying."
"But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it importance beyond what we're certain of."
"Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes."
"But it's more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt that it actually exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not sure."
The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod characters showed up some months ago looking for it.
The Augur?
Just what have you gotten yourself involved in?
"Whatever is going on, whatever you're up to... Be very careful."
Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial Authority on magic these last few hundred years.
"My understanding is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic."
"I was quite surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough, but their line of questioning made me... uneasy."
"It became clear they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate power."
No one here does.
"The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere in Skyrim. They inquired about the ruins of Mzulft, but that's all I remember."
"It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why."
"I suppose if you're intent on looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative."
Mother's calling me. It's time for me to sleep now. I'm so tired. Thank you for making her feel better.
"Who's there? Is that you, father?"
<humming>
Have you found proof of Alva's treachery?
Is Hroggar innocent or not?
You better get proof of your accusations against Alva.
Any word on that fire?
I hear the steward asked you to look into the fire.
Have you found out anything about Alva?
Have you seen Laelette? Have you seen my wife?
She's dead. Laelette is dead.
I won't let you hurt Alva!
Now I'm going to have to kill you!
I hear you put Laelette out of her misery.
Helgi. But father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Are you a stranger?
I remember you. You're the stranger. Father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
"The smoke woke me up. It was hot and I was scared, so I hid."
Then it got cold and dark. I'm not scared anymore.
But I'm lonely. Will you play with me?
Like I said. It got hot and smoky. Now it's cold and quiet.
I wish someone would find me.
You know him?
"He made my favorite dolly, but I can't find her."
Are you sure you aren't a stranger?
Don't you remember? His name is Hroggar.
Okay! Let's play hide and seek. You find me and I'll tell you.
"We have to wait for nighttime though. The other one is playing too, and she can't come out until then."
That's cheating. We're playing hide and seek. You have to find me before Laelette does.
They call themselves the [QUOTE]Blood Horkers.[QUOTE]
"They've been around as long as I can remember, but only recently focused on our ships."
"A dastardly group, but they're more than simple brigands. Shrewd. Clever. Not to be trifled with."
Here you go. Try not to spill anything on them.
"Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were close."
Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since.
"Somewhere in the ice fields, if you want to try to find him."
"Somewhere up north, in the ice fields."
"Said he found some old Dwemer artifact, but... well, that was years ago."
Haven't heard from him since.
Looking for my husband Nazeem? Check the Jarl's backside. That's usually where he stuffs himself these days.
Are you married? You look the type. Make sure you treat your wife with the respect she deserves.
"Here you stand, talking to a married woman. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind."
"Here you stand, talking to a still grieving widow. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind."
"Men are all alike, from Skyrim to Hammerfell. They care only for war and politics, and treat their women like cattle."
"I work for Belethor, at the general goods store."
"Come by Belethor's shop, at the market. I'm sure we've got something you need."
"Don't mean to be rude, but I'm too busy to talk right now."
This war's as stupid as our feud with Clan Gray-Mane.
"Need something? Unlike the rest of my family, I've got work to do."
My brother Jon's got the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war.
My brother Jon had the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war. Too bad he died before he had the chance.
"My boy Lars has been getting beat senseless, and by a girl, no less!"
"The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!"
Chops and steaks fit for a jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs!
"Need something? Talk to my brother, Elrindir."
You should try the venison. It's delicious.
Do you hunt? The plains outside Whiterun are ripe with game.
Shhh. You'll scare the deer.
Oh! You startled me. I wasn't expecting company out here.
You look rather pale. Could be Ataxia. It's quite a problem back home in Cyrodiil.
These Stormcloaks are ridiculous. They won't shop here because they think I'll sell them poisoned tonics. I should just go back to Cyrodiil.
"Pardon me, but do I detect a case of the Rattles? I've got something for that."
I have several elixirs for sale.
Maybe a hardy Nord like you doesn't need a cure-all. Hmm? What about an invisibility potion?
"I'm... Well, who I am isn't important. Let's leave it at that, hmm?"
"Forget Solitude or Windhelm. Whiterun was the crown jewel of Skyrim before... Well, before... Never mind."
This was such a glorious city. But then everything had to change. The Empire came... and my brother was lost...
"Ah, but Skyrim! Skyrim is supreme among all nations! Our people, our native people, are unmatched in all Tamriel!"
One day the war will end and the true heirs of Skyrim will inherit this great realm.
"Imperials, Stormcloaks... I don't care who's in charge around here. I just want to make money!"
"Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second."
"I'd even buy one of your relatives, if you're looking to sell. Ha ha ha ha. That's a little joke."
You just let me know what you need. I am at your beck and call.
"Welcome to Belethor's General Goods. Welcome, indeed."
"I know what you're thinking: [QUOTE]This Belethor, how could he part with such magnificent treasures?[QUOTE]"
"I might just be a servant among lords, but don't think for a moment I don't take my duties as seriously as the jarl himself takes his!"
"If my cleanin' gets in your way, just say the word an' I'll be off."
"This here is Dragonsreach, an' it's my task to see it looks fit for a jarl, night an' day."
"Ain't nobody high and mighty in these halls, exceptin' the Jarl. And don't you forget!"
Don't you go trackin' your dirty boots on my clean floor!
Soldiers! They're everywhere these days. And not a one of them knows how to pick up after themselves.
"My poor Fralia thinks Thorald's still alive, but I know better."
"Whiterun belongs to the true sons of Skyrim now, just as it should."
"We Gray-Manes got just as much to be proud of as them Battle-Borns, but you won't see us with our noses in the air."
Got of lot of steel to shape.
Hmm?
I ain't much for talkin'.
Why you still starin' at me?
"Never much cared for that Balgruuf myself. He was in the Empire's pocket, so to speak."
"Bits and baubles for sale, all crafted by the best blacksmith in Skyrim."
Come see my collection of Gray-Mane's finest trinkets! You'll not find their like in all Tamriel!
Shiny trinkets for your good lady! All crafted by the great Eorlund Gray-Mane himself!
"My Eorlund is the finest blacksmith in Skyrim, and that's not just a wife's boasting."
I can't stand those braggart Battle-Borns. They think they're the gods' gift to Whiterun.
"Eorlund and I... we both miss our son terribly. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials."
"I...I miss our son terribly, especially since Eorlund died. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials."
"Oh, I always knew my Thorald was alive. Ain't a man in Skyrim who can keep a Gray-Mane down."
Everyone thinks Thorald is dead. But not me. I know my boy is alive out there. Somewhere...
"When the Stormcloaks took control of Whiterun, it was a victory for all true Nords."
I take my duties as Housecarl very seriously. I won't hesitate to shed blood if my uncle Vignar is threatened.
"It's not easy being a woman in Skyrim, I know. But stay strong, and men will come to respect you, and maybe even fear you."
What's the matter? You can't stand the sight of a strong Nord woman?
"I miss the days when the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns got along. Ever since the war started, we've been at each others' throats."
"There's nothing a man can do that I can't do better, whether it's serving drinks or slaying trolls."
The daughters of this land are just as strong and loyal as its men.
"You wouldn't know it now, but the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns were once fast friends."
"I enjoy this work well enough, but I'm ready to retire. I've been thinking of selling the inn to Ysolda. Anyway, what do you need?"
What can I get you?
"Hungry, tired, or just plain thirsty?"
"I'm just out and about, love. The Bannered Mare can do without me for a bit, I suspect."
"I don't get much time time off from the tavern, but I enjoy it when I do."
I'll get back to the Bannered Mare soon enough. Just need to stretch my legs a bit...
"If it's work you're looking for, Hulda's the one to talk to."
"If you need more food or drink, speak to Hulda."
"Mind your manners and pay your bills, and you'll always be welcome."
There was a great battle here in Whiterun. It was quite thrilling! I must compose a song about it someday.
"If it's a lady you're looking for, you'd best look elsewhere. Once Mikael gets them, they're got."
I'm a bard by trade. Perhaps you've heard of me?
"I don't have much of a reputation in Skyrim yet, but I'm working on that, one sweet lady at a time. Haha!"
"No doubt they still tell tales of Mikael and his sweet songs across Cyrodiil, where last I traveled."
I enjoy steady patronage in the Bannered Mare. I do hope you'll watch me perform.
Want to hear a little Nord wisdom? You don't really know a woman 'til you've had a strong drink and a fistfight with her.
"Keep walkin', softgut. I'm more woman than you can handle."
"I got no quarrel with you, but I won't turn one down, neither."
"Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now you, my girl, have definitely come to the right place."
Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now don't let the name worry you - we got plenty o' steel for fightin' men.
"We've got small weapons as well as big. Maces, daggers, that sort of thing."
"You look like maybe you need a new weapon. Something big, perhaps? An axe maybe? Or a greatsword?"
"Most of our weapons were crafted by Adrianne Avenicci. My woman's an artist, is what she is."
"Crush, clobber, slash or slice. We've got a weapon for any occasion."
"Ah, hello my Nord friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
"Ah, hello my Argonian friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
"Ah, hello my Khajiit friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
"Ah, kinsman. How my heart soars to look upon a brother Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?"
"Ah... How my heart soars to look upon a sister Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?"
"Hello, friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
"Hagraven or horker, it matters not. We've got the arrows to fell any game."
So what can I get you?
Whiterun once again belongs to its rightful heirs. It's a glorious day for Skyrim.
We Gray-Manes have been feuding with the Battle-Borns for years. There's no more bitter enemy than an old friend.
"When the Empire surrendered to the Aldmeri Dominion, they shamed us all!"
"The people saw fit to name me Jarl, and I don't intend to let them down."
You're lookin' at a real warrior! At least I used to be.
"Look at you! Betcha think you're something, huh?"
"For thirty years, I served the Legion as a commander. Fought in the Great War."
"Vignar and I have our hands full. It's no small task, running an entire hold."
"When I became Steward, I had to give up the bottle. The people of the hold need me at my best."
I'd be dead if not for Vignar. He took me in and helped me turn my life around.
"I had a bad time a few years back, an' I turned to drink. But Vignar, he wouldn't let me stay weak."
"Oh, I'm just a servant, dear. You want to talk to one of the Companions, I'm sure."
I've been tending to the warriors of Jorrvaskr for as long as I can remember.
"I see everything, hear everything and know everything."
"Oh, I'm a good keeper of secrets. Have to be, in this hall."
I hope the Empire is sending reinforcements to drive these heathens out of Whiterun.
"Olfrid, patron of the great Clan Battle-Born, a name I'm sure you know well."
"I'm as much a Nord as the next man, but I'm no fool. I don't live in the past, like those Gray-Manes."
Eorlund Gray-Mane's a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor.
Eorlund Gray-Mane was a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor. Now he's dead.
"Clan Battle-Born's got a proud lineage in Whiterun, but unlike the Gray-Manes, we've also got wealth."
"My bloodin' days might be over, but my son Idolaf is out there fightin' for Skyrim! Fightin' for the Empire! Ha!"
It's a miracle these Stormcloaks haven't robbed us blind yet. I'm sure it's only a matter of time.
"There's a rift here in Skyrim, and can't neither magic nor the passin' of time make it right."
Evgir Unslaad has come at last. The [QUOTE]Season Unending.[QUOTE] War... without end.
Can you believe those pathetic Gray-Manes still show their face in public?
"There was love between our families. For generations. Now, there is only enmity."
Has the Empire forsaken us? How could Whiterun fall into the hands of these stinking half-wit Nords?
"Damn those Gray-Manes to Oblivion. They want to back the Stormcloaks, they'll get what's comin' to 'em."
"Avulstein Gray-Mane and I were best friends as children. If I see that traitor again, I'll throw him in jail myself!"
"The cold, frightening truth is that the Empire represents progress. Anyone who fears progress is a coward."
The Stormcloaks are content to live in the past forever. No wonder the Provincials think we're all baseless savages.
"Well met, kinsman."
"Well met, traveler."
You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.
"People have forgotten humor, poetry and romance. I love a good sword fight as much as the next man, but there's more to life."
"It's my desire to enter the Bards College. My parents are hesitant, but I pray they let me attend."
"All I want it is to escape from this madness. And if Olfina can come with me, all the better. But I've probably said too much."
It's no fun getting pushed around all the time...
"I don't know what you did, but Braith won't even look at me now! So thanks!"
"My friend Olava? The seer? She says things will get better for me, once I start sticking up for myself."
I can't fight. Not even a little bit. My family thinks I'm a little milk drinker.
"By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?"
"Maybe some other time I'll reveal your destiny, hmm? Tea leaves, palm reading, crystal scrying... Oooh! Maybe trepanning? Ha ha ha ha."
"Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Sorry, pup, but I'm not quite in the mood."
"Oh, I tell the future, all right. When I feel up to the task, that is. But I'm afraid my energies haven't quite peaked yet today."
Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale! Straight from the fields and orchards of Whiterun to your table!
"Fresh-baked loaves, still warm from the oven!"
"I've got a hungry daughter to feed, so selling my produce is really the only thing I care about."
I hope you're looking at me like that because you want to buy something?
"I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work."
Did you know there are some fruits that actually grow better in the cold weather?
You'd be surprised how much work it is selling things at a stall. It's not all standing around and chatting.
Praise Talos and all the Divines! Whiterun has been liberated by the true sons of Skyrim!
You have come! You have come to hear the word of Talos!
The Imperials silence us because they fear us! They are cowards! Cowards and fools who have forgotten the truth!
There are those who would silence the Dragon's truth! But not I! Not Heimskr! His word will be known!
"The truth, child of Talos, is that the Dragon's children have come! To purge the world in fire and righteousness!"
"He has returned... Oh, how Talos has returned. Helgen has been purged in his light. Will Whiterun be next?"
"Once I've made enough money trading with the Khajiit caravans, I'm going to buy the Bannered Mare from Hulda."
I spend a lot of time at the market stalls so I can learn the merchant's trade.  I need more experience if I'm going to run an inn someday.
They say there's nothing a Nord woman can't do if she puts her mind to it.
"We Nords are strong, and we're as tough as stone. But I'll bet you didn't know there's some of us with a good head for business, too."
There's some company I certainly prefer over others. Have you met Mikael? The most amazing bard I've ever heard.
I just want to go home and read.
"Excuse me, but I'm trying to read."
Nothing like a good adventure or romance to lose yourself in.
I import books  whenever I can. Most Nord works are too bawdy and violent for my tastes.
"My daughter Braith says I read too much. [QUOTE]Play with me, mother![QUOTE] Girls need to learn how to take care of themselves."
"Really, I wish my girl would read more. It would certainly keep her out of all those fights."
"If you'll excuse me, I really just want to get home."
You tried mercenary work? It might suit you.
"Sometimes I miss the soldier's life, but when I hold my daughter in my arms, I know I made the right choice."
"My wife's a good woman. She can be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I love her just the same."
"My wife was a good woman. She could be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I loved her just the same. Gods I miss her."
"What're you lookin' at? I'm not afraid of you, ya know. Even if you are my elder."
"Boys, girls, dogs, elders - there's nobody I won't fight!"
"I don't fight Lars no more, if that's what you're worried about."
"Stupid Lars Battle-Born. I fight him almost every day, but it's not much of a fight, 'cause he don't fight back."
"I spend so much time among the dead, I sometimes forget how much I miss the company of the living."
"With this terrible war, I'm a bit overwhelmed. As are the catacombs."
"As Whiterun's priest of Arkay, I spread his word whenever I'm able. In the meantime, most of my hours are spent with the city's dearly departed."
I ain't done nothin'.
What? Why you lookin' at me?
That Heimskr's crazy. Him and his talk o' Talos. Wish he'd just shut up.
"You're in my home. That's right. This here place, Breezehome, it belongs to old Terek."
"Oho! And what do you want, hmm?"
"You can't kick me out of here. You want me gone, you're gonna have to kill me."
"Now I don't care about no deeds, or laws, or other nonsense like that. This house was empty, so I settled in. And now it's mine."
"I'm a generous man, to those who treat me right. Might be I'll even let you live here with me, if you mind your manners."
"Hello, child of Kynareth."
"Lately it seems I am more nurse than priestess, tending to those who have suffered, both in mind and body, from this terrible war."
"These are trying times for us all, I know. Many come to the Temple of Kynareth to pray, and I assist them as best I'm able."
"Come to chat with an old woman, hmm? Do your good deed for the day?"
"Looking for a horse? I own these stables, but Skulvar can help you with a purchase."
"Do you like horses? You  should visit the stables. I own them, you see. And our stock is excellent."
"My friend Maven and I - have you met Maven, in Riften? - we know our place in this world. Know the place of others, too."
"Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying - of course you don't."
"Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. Very successful business. Obviously."
"I actually advise the Jarl on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head."
There's a nip in the air. Cold won't be good for my crops. Never is.
"I own the Pelagia Farm, just outside the city walls. Nimriel takes good care of things for me."
"I had my years of war and fighting. Senseless, all of it. All I want now is a rake and a patch of good soil."
"Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the [QUOTE]great warriors[QUOTE]?"
"It seems this damnable conflict has claimed everyone's passions of late. Me, I prefer my books, and my spells."
"There's a tranquility in magic, don't you think? It is simply energy, to be harnessed by those with the will and knowledge to do so."
"Got some good pieces out here, if you're looking to buy. More inside."
I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane's got that honor. Man's steel is legendary. All I ask is a fair chance.
"I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane was that and more, but now he's dead. All I ask is a fair chance."
"Have you met my father? He's the steward, up at Dragonsreach."
"Have you met my father? He was the steward, up at Dragonsreach when Balgruuf was Jarl."
I help my father in more ways than people realize.
"You think all the council my father provides the Jarl is his alone? Hmph. Let's just say I advise the advisor, and leave it at that."
"Be warned, the Jarl is in a foul mood since the Stormcloaks overran Whiterun."
I serve Jarl Baalgruuf as steward.
"The Jarl is, as you can imagine, very busy. Perhaps I can assist you?"
The task of Steward is more important than you realize. The Jarl often asks for my invaluable council.
"I'm kept so busy, I don't get to see my daughter as often as I'd like. Perhaps you've met her? Adrianne? She owns the shop, Warmaiden's."
"After Whiterun is retaken, Ulfric will pay in blood for his insolence."
You should be talking to my Steward.
"I'm the Jarl, not a barkeep. Speak your business."
"Quickly now, or would you prefer I let Whiterun fall to the Stormcloaks?"
"You might be a guest in Dragonsreach, but you're starting to try my patience."
What is it that you need?
You have my attention.
Speak your mind.
It pleases me to see you again.
All this standing around is rubbish. We should be taking the fight to the Stormcloaks.
"I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me, and point me at the enemy."
"My brother takes council from Proventus Avenicci? What a laugh. He takes council from his daughter, and she's a bloody blacksmith."
I'm the commander of the guard here in Whiterun.
My boys'll keep you safe. Don't you worry.
"You're not thinking of causing trouble here in this beautiful city, now are you? 'Cause I'd strongly advise against such foolishness."
"I'll always be a commander, even if those Stormcloak dogs have stripped away my power."
The Legion will regain control of this city. Mark my words.
Yes? What is it?
"I'm commander of the guard, now."
The Stormcloaks can keep this city safe better than those Legion lapdogs.
"The security in Whiterun is terrible. Shameful, is what it is."
The guards in this city are all lazy and undisciplined. Things need to change...
Commander Cauis walks around Dragonsreach like a preening rooster. I could do his job blindfolded....
"You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household."
"We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not."
Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.
"It seems our enemies have no end of spies, saboteurs and assassins to send against us."
Think very carefully about your next move...
"Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching."
Keep your distance...
Got the fleetest steeds in all o' Skyrim.
"Make a move toward Balgruuf, and you're dead."
"Gal like you needs a warhorse, I reckon."
"Man like you needs a warhorse, I reckon."
Only thing better than ridin' a swift horse is ridin' a swift horse over the enemy.
Lookin' to shatter records or bones? My beasts can do both.
"Need a horse? Talk to my father, Skulvar."
"Old lady Maiden-Loom owns the stables. But my father and me, we run things."
So I mostly sweep and shovel. You got a problem with that?
Father says I ain't smart enough to be stablemaster. Some day.
My father never thought I was smart enough to be a stablemaster. I just wish he was around to see me now.
Come to gawk at the dark elf?
Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.
"I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer, not a great wanderer, like you."
"Ah, hello my good friend. Would you do me a kindness? I seem to be down to my last drop of spirits. Let me tell you, sobriety is highly overrated."
"Careful if you cross the river to the east. Old Hajvarr Iron-Hand and his brigands are holed up in that cave, White River Watch."
"The circle of stones to the southwest? That's Secunda's Kiss. The giants hold it sacred, so tread carefully."
"You know, I saw something near Shimmermist Cave, to the northeast. Some kind of creature... small and wicked. Never seen its like before."
"If you're heading east, steer clear of Hillgrund's Tomb. Thing about those old crypts - the dead having trouble staying that way."
Looking to do some hunting? Avoid Brittleshin Pass. It's southeast of here.
"Yesterday, I saw a dragon fly right over the city. Headed northeast. Toward Shearpoint, by the looks of it."
"Be glad you're here in the city, and not out in Riverwood. Those poor sods don't even have a wall."
"You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can."
"Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready."
"Need a blade? You should talk to Adrianne, at the forge."
"Need supplies? See Belethor at his store. Sleazy little man, but he has good stock."
"If you need potions, you should try Arcadia's Cauldron."
"Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come."
"I worry about the other settlements in the hold. Unwalled, lightly manned - prime targets for those damned dragons."
"Rorikstead's a nice enough little hamlet, but a boring posting for a guard. If a dragon attacks, well... then it'll be a different story."
"You look tired, friend. The Bannered Mare has beds for rent."
"Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself."
On top of the Throat of the World is a patch of snow that's never melted.
"They say the Greybeards taught it to ignore the sun, and heat simply washes over it."
The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.
The ivory produced by those beasts is as hard as iron. But the giants have found ways to make it yield.
They're able to grind it down so fine that it can be infused into the lattice of packed snow.
"The finished material has the delicate nature of fresh powder snow, but the strength of the hardest steel."
The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War.
The nearest modern incarnation of it is the strange rituals practiced by the Forsworn.
"With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form."
It's difficult to explain to the layman -- forgive me if I begin waxing alchemic.
Figures -- I doubt you have sufficient knowledge to harm the Phial even if you wanted to.
"Either way, this is the end of it."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out."
Here's for your trouble.
"Command me, my Listener."
"Anything you need, Listener."
"Oh yes, Listener!"
(bark)
What do you need?
What is it?
What do you want?
Show me.
What?
"Yes, my Thane?"
Did you need something?
It shall be done.
Of course. Right away.
"With pleasure, my Listener!"
(woof!)
"Okay, got it."
It will be done.
"As you say, it will happen."
Then that is my task.
Will do.
"No problem, I'll handle it."
Oh Listener. Can't you see that's impossible?
"Sorry, Listener. It can't be done."
"If only I could, Listener."
(whine)
Can't do that. Sorry.
Not possible.
That can't be done.
Can't do it.
No. Not possible.
"I'm sorry, that can't be done."
I was beginning to lose faith that any help would come.
Eh... You see... I've been thinking about Faleen quite a bit. You know Faleen?
"We are devoted to the Goddess Mara, who gave mortals the gift of love that they might have a hint of eternity."
Her blessings are many. To love is to know the true nature of the gods.
Are you the one sent by Mara?
I'm sure I know what this is about.
She thinks she's in love with Bassianus and wants to leave town. With him.
Let me tell you how I see it.
"Until a few months ago, the girl was head over heels for Klimmek. Wouldn't stop talking about him."
"Now if I thought she was really in love with Bassianus, that would be one thing. But she's a child."
It will pass.
"Oh, my love. How I long to take her away from all of this."
Why did Boti send you to me?
"Oh, Fastred. I'm not sure what happened. One moment she's smiling at me, the next I can't even meet her eyes."
I'll bet Bassianus would know what's going on. He understands women.
Are you prepared to receive my golden words?
Wonderful. I'll write it out so you won't forget it.
"Hmmm. I don't think you've got enough to cover my expenses with Silver-Bloods, much less convince me give my words away."
"Come back when you've got the gold, then."
Pardon me?
This is... more than I could have hoped for. Have you really done this for me?
"I have to see her. Please, excuse me."
Not all can hear the broad echoes of deepest dawn.
"To receive the touch of Mara, you must first act as her hands in the world."
Explore the facets of the infinite jewel.
"The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see."
Mara has reflected an image to me. At the foot of the throat and young woman... almost a girl... her fickle love must resolve itself.
"The village of Ivarstead. The woman, Fastred."
This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants. Return when she has seen her path.
I will entreat Mara on your behalf.
May you carry the warmth of Mara to all corners of the frozen wastes.
"The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see."
I prayed to Mara and she spoke to me in a dream. She said a stranger would appear to help me.
Is that you?
My parents are being impossible.
"Bassianus wants to marry me. And I think I love him. But he wants to move to Riften afterwards, and my father won't allow it."
"He only cares about this stupid town, but Bassianus makes me happier than anyone ever has."
"My mother's not any help, either."
"Oh, thank you so much! It's wonderful to have someone around who understands."
You know how children are. Her fancies change with the moon.
"And like always, the boy lacks any kind of spine. He'll need some convincing."
A little push and this would all be simpler.
Look around here. There's not much left.
"Used to be a good-sized town, but folks have been moving to Riften for a while now."
"If all the young people leave, what happens to Ivarstead?"
Oh my. Probably something about the men. We all wish we had her problems.
"Now, don't tell my husband, but I don't have any problem with Bassianus."
"Even if it means her leaving Ivarstead, I want Fastred to be happy."
"If they just snuck out of town together, I could manage my husband."
What did you call me?
"Ysmir's beard, you're right! No fish was ever caught by staying away from the shore. I'm off to see her!"
"Fastred, I have something to say to you."
Klimmek? What is it?
I don't want you to leave Ivarstead.
Why not?
Because... I would miss you.
But I thought you only cared about your fishing!
What good are fish if you have to eat them alone?
"Oh, Klimmek..."
"Fastred, we must speak."
"Bassianus, sweetie, what is it?"
"We must leave. Your father will never approve of us, and I grow weary of this place."
Where will we go?
"To Riften, my pet. How you'll adore the city."
"Oh, and to be with you!"
"I always had a feeling she liked me. More than that brute Jofthor, at least."
Jofthor... what about him? He'll come after us and... it will be unpleasant.
The trouble is that I can't seem to speak around her.
"My mouth goes dry, and I start to shake."
I could never hope to approach her.
Then you know what a beauty she is.
"Well, suffice to say she is resplendent, but not without resolve. Striking, in all senses."
Faleen... I...
Sssh. It's all right. You don't need to say anymore. I had no idea you were so... nuanced.
I love you.
"So I hear. Come here, you."
I'm not sure what this is all about.
This is... lovely. Calcelmo wrote this... about me? I never knew he had such feeling in him.
Clearly. I've never even thought of him in that manner. I wish that I was as skilled with words as he.
"Here, take him this letter. I may not be as eloquent as he is, but I hope he understands."
"The goddess smiles at your efforts, child. The dawn shines bright upon you."
"You have seen the young, fickle love of youth, and helped a more seasoned love find its way."
There is one final aspect we wish for you to explore. For a strong love can withstand storms and even survive death.
Take this symbol of Mara. She will guide you to the wandering souls of two whose love was so great that their entwinement binds them to this world.
Nothing else? I'm always eager.
That everything?
Is that all?
(panting)
Anything else?
Is that all?
Do you need anything else?
We done?
That it?
Anything else before you go?
"Now wait a minute, Listener. Even Cicero has his limits! Not many, mind you... but I do have them..."
I won't do it. You ask too much.
But Listener... Are you sure? I just can't bring myself to do it...
(growl)
Not for you. Not for anyone.
Even Khajiit have their limits. No.
Maybe you want to rethink what you're asking?
"I will not drag my honor through the mud for you, or anyone."
Forget it. I don't do that kind of work.
"I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do something like that. Even for you."
Your efforts have helped illuminate the entire province. I trust by now you've achieved a higher comprehension of love.
"Carry the blessings of Mara with you, so the rest of the province may shine with her glories."
J'zargo is listening.
"Anything, as long as I get to fight."
Name it.
What do you need?
(bark)
All right. What is it?
What do you need?
Go ahead. What is it?
What is it?
Fine. What?
"Yes, Thane. What is it?"
You want me to do something or not?
Do you have any orders?
Still something you'd like me to do?
Did you require something of J'zargo?
Did you still need me for something?
"So, did you still need my assistance?"
(panting)
Still need me to do something?
Do you still need me to do something?
"You wanted me to do something, yes?"
You still wish something of me?
Still have something you need?
I'm on it.
Right away.
With pleasure.
Right.
(woof)
Let's see it.
Point the way.
"Let us see it, then."
As you will.
"Right, then."
"Okie dokie, Listener."
All right.
As you will.
Very well.
(bark)
All right.
As you wish.
Very well.
Fine.
Your call.
Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes.
Life's hard enough with all these men propositioning me. But that bard is the worst.
"We're used to getting by on scraps, but the Shatter-Shields want everything for nothing."
"Poor Roggi. If you're feeling charitable, buy the Nord a mead. He's good for it."
"Ranmir beg a drink from you, yet? That's gold wasted, friend."
You a fighting man? How about a little bet?
You a fighting girl? How about a little bet?
Think you can go blade to blade with me? You'd be dead in six seconds.
"You. You a Dark Elf lover? Get out of our city, you filthy piece of trash."
You damn gray-skin. Go back to Morrowind!
"I'm the best warrior in Morthal, and that's no boast."
"The corn stores are getting low again, Orgnar."
You promised me you'd sweep the entranceway.
I still need you to make a batch of those fried potatoes. We can serve them with the ale.
"You are going to brew a new batch of ale, right? Like we talked about? What we have's been sitting in that barrel for over a month."
Yep.
And... you'll take care of it?
"Wait, let me guess. You'll get to it later."
Don't I always?
"I don't suppose I could convince you to take care of it now, could I?"
No.
"Well. There's something to be said for honesty, I suppose."
I should have guessed.
"Sven, we need to talk..."
Here we go...
"It's about your singing. Well, not your singing, your songs. But you know what I'm talking about."
"You do realize these simpletons wouldn't know real music if it bit them in the britches, hmm? Very well. Your wish is my command."
Wonderful. And let's not have this chat again next week. Agreed?
"Lucan, we don't sell silver buckles, do we? One of the customers was asking."
"We don't sell any imports from Summerset Isle, do we, Lucan?"
"Lucan, I was thinking we should have a grand sale. Lower the prices by half, maybe get some jugglers. We could attract lots of new customers."
"No, dear sister. We do not."
I'm afraid not.
"A sale? To attract new customers? Camilla, everyone in Riverwood already shops here. There are no more customers."
Hmm. All right. Do you think... maybe we should?
"Well, I was thinking... we should. We could stock all kinds of specialty items. You know, to cater to some of our more.... [QUOTE]eclectic[QUOTE] customers."
"Hmmm... Well, maybe we could go on a sort of trip. Take the wares on the road. Get some new customers."
"That's really not at the top of my list, no. Please, Camilla, I need you to focus."
"Dear sister, we talked about this sort of thing before. We sell dry goods, nothing more, nothing less."
"Camilla, really? You don't have better things to do? Because I could certainly find quite a few tasks..."
"Of course, Lucan. Of course. I was just, well... Never mind."
"Okay, okay. Just trying make this place a little less... boring."
"I know, I know. My head's in the clouds again. Just... forget I said anything."
"Can I make something now, papa?"
Is it time yet? Time for me to make my sword? Or maybe... an axe?
"I'm bored standing around, papa. I could take over for you..."
"Later, little one. I need to finish what I'm working on. But keep watching. Watch, and learn."
"He he. Not just yet, Dorthe. I need to keep forging, and you need to keep watching."
"Patience, Dorthe. You'll get some time at the forge, I promise you. But not right now. You need to keep watching me. That's how you'll learn."
"Don't worry, I am."
All right. But I am getting a bit tired of waiting.
"Yes, sir."
"Dorthe, dear, I've been growin' some really lovely vegetables. Maybe tomorrow you could help me plant a new patch? What do you say?"
"Dorthe... I was thinkin' I'd knit a couple of blankets, sell them to Lucan. Would you like to make one? Might be fun, workin' together."
"You know, Dorthe, with all those vegetables I've been growing lately, I was thinkin' we could make a right lovely stew. Together. How about it?"
Oh. Um. Well... You see...
"Wow. Yeah. That sounds great, mother. Only, um... it's just that..."
"Oooh. Ahhh... Well... See, the thing is..."
Shor's crown! There are things ladies like us are supposed to do. We've talked about this...
"Let me guess. You'd rather play [QUOTE]Daedra and Battlemages[QUOTE] with Ordnar. Or go fishing, or catch frogs..."
"Dorthe, listen to me. Your father and your friend may treat you like a boy, but you're not. Do you understand? So please. Be a girl. For me."
"It's just that papa promised I could make something at the forge. So maybe we could do something together, hmmm... next week? Is... that okay?"
"Just stop trying to change me, mother! I'm not a baby anymore! I'm almost a woman! I... I can't be who I want to be!"
"I'm sorry, mother. I can't help it. All that stuff you like to do, it's just so... boring."
"Ho, now... Keep me out of this..."
"Fine. You play in the mud, or play with your father's forge, or get into sword fights with your little friend. But this is not over."
"Oh, Dorthe. You're breaking your mother's heart, you know that?"
"Well. I can see your father and I are going to have to talk about this. And when we do, things are going to change."
"Hey boy, I heard you nailed a Septim into Lucan's doorstep. Damn near drove him crazy. That true?"
"Tell me, son. Any truth to these stories I been hearing. About you gluing a cow's udders shut? You really do something like that?"
"Heard me a rumor, boy. Something about you putting bugs in the stew over at the Sleeping Giant. You do this?"
Sure I did. And I'd do it again.
Yeah. So?
"Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I sure did. It was one of my best pranks yet, father."
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's my boy!
"Ha! I knew it! Had your name written all over it, that one did!"
"See, now that's what I'm talking about. Working hard, making your mark on this world. Good job, son."
He he he he he.
You just wait. My new pranks are going to the best ever! You'll see! He he he he.
Ha! That ain't nothing. Wait till you see what I got planned for next week.
"You mean the Dragon Bridge issue? I'll be honest with you, I was planning to let that go. Varnius is a bit jumpy at the best of times."
"The cave has a bad history. Long ago, Potema the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name."
That was over 500 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.
"There have been reports of weird happenings near Wolfskull Cave. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps bandits."
"I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but if you want to clear out the cave, I'll make sure you're repaid for your work."
There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful.
"The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing."
The magical energies underneath the College still require purification. Your assistance would be most useful.
"As you may be aware, the College has gone to great lengths to purify and enhance the natural energies of the world."
"This both enhances our connection to the realm of magic, and eliminates possible interference from outside sources."
"These energies, on occasion, become... polluted. Effort must be made to see that they are kept pure, clean."
Do you wish to aid in this cleansing?
Very well. These specially enchanted gloves will allow you to delve directly into the focal points for these energies.
Go to each focal point and remove whatever impurities you may find there.
Return the gloves to me when you have finished.
Please exercise caution. This is not a procedure without possible... consequences.
Use the gloves to clear the focal points. Return to me when you have finished. I thought I made this rather clear.
I see.
"Yes, they have. I can feel the difference already. But of course, I'm far more in tune with these sorts of things than most."
Thank you. I appreciate your assistance.
"Silus keeps filling his house with those Mythic Dawn things. Creepy, I tell you."
"I can't believe Silus is collecting Mythic Dawn artifacts. Right here in Dawnstar, no less."
"Did you have any questions about the museum, or would you rather talk business?"
What is it? Do you have one of the Razor fragments?
I keep gazing into the pommel gem. Not a single flaw.
I've had to be careful handling those blade shards you found. They're each sharp enough to sever a finger with no effort.
It's strange holding a hilt that isn't connected to a dagger. Oh well.
My family were in the Mythic Dawn. My museum is our legacy.
"Wrong or right, the Mythic Dawn changed Tamriel's history. They deserve study."
Scholars from around the world will come here one day.
Mara will protect you.
I'll wait here.
"I'll just be here, then."
"We'll be waiting, then."
I will wait.
Back to the great task of waiting.
"I'll be right here, then."
"I'm ready, let's continue."
"All set, let's go."
Lead on.
"You lead, I'll follow."
"Let's get going, then."
"We follow, then."
Khajiit will follow.
"Lead on, friend."
May the Hist guide us.
Let's tread softly.
Lead. I'll follow.
Malacath witness our deeds.
Lead us to our next task.
Go where the challenge is greatest.
Let's go.
"Lead on, then."
Following.
"Here you are. Now remember, people in Skyrim respond to deeds. You will find more people interested in your love if you help them."
Good luck. Mara bless you.
"Lost the last one I gave you? Very well, here you are. Mara keep you."
"I'm sorry, but even Mara's Temple needs coin. We will have a symbol ready for you when you come back with enough gold."
You've embarrassed the temple and spat in the face of love. What do you want?
Is that an Amulet of Mara? I'm surprised someone like you isn't spoken for.
An Amulet of Mara? You're not married? Surprising.
"That amulet. I've seen the Nords wear these when they're looking to marry. With your strength, you should have no trouble."
Is that Lady Mara's amulet? I'm shocked a fine person like you isn't married already.
You're wearing Mara's amulet? You? I'd marry you. I'd marry you twice.
Look at you. Wearing an Amulet of Mara. Are you saying you're available?
"An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?"
You should arrange the ceremony at the Temple of Mara right away. I can't wait.
You go ahead and arrange the wedding ceremony when you're ready.
You should speak to the priest in the Temple of Mara to arrange the ceremony. No sense waiting.
"Have you spoken to the Temple of Mara, yet? I'm so excited."
"Hey, shouldn't you tell the Temple of Mara that we're getting married? Be hard to have a wedding without a priest."
Now shouldn't you be off arranging our wedding day? Don't keep me waiting.
You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.
I'll see you at our wedding!
Our wedding is soon. I'll see you then!
"Never thought I'd get married under a Nord god. But with you, it feels right."
"Our wedding is soon, under Mara's loving eyes. It'll be perfect."
"We have our wedding soon, don't we? That's right, we do!"
I'm looking forward to our wedding. You and me....
The wedding is soon. It'll be a good day.
"You wish to be married? It's good to see love blossoming, even during these difficult times."
"Your wedding will be held tomorrow, from dawn until dusk."
"Don't be late, you don't want to miss your own wedding!"
The Sybil of Dibella spends her entire life in direct communion with the goddess.
"From the time she's a little girl to the moment she expires, she is a direct connection with the heavenly mother."
"From her reverie, we know the mind of our god."
"We have had a vision of the next Sybil, living in a village to the north. She must be brought to the temple for her reverie to begin."
"It's considered a great honor for the family. Their daughter will never know hardship, and the goddess blesses them with great bounty."
We prefer not to announce that the Sybil has died until we can introduce the new one. People like to know that we're connected to the goddess.
"You, my dear, can earn the Blessing of Dibella. You'll find men to be more pliable in the future... or more vulnerable."
"Have you heard of the Blessing of Dibella? It can help you with the wooing of women, if that's your aim."
Or give you strength if you happen to offend one.
"Typically we avoid bestowing it upon men, but for the Sybil's escort, we could make an exception."
"Our daughter, Fjotra, was taken from here. The Forsworn descended and... they didn't touch anything else. Just our little girl."
It was the Forsworn from Broken Tower. Never been much trouble before. What's it to you?
"She... really? That's... I wouldn't have dreamed. Of course, we need her in Markarth, then. I'll come with you."
"That's... that's good of you. If you were to save her, I would be very grateful. I don't think there's anything I could give you, though..."
"My mother's been haunting me ever since she died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad she's here."
"My mother's been haunting me ever since she died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad she's here."
"My father's been haunting me ever since he died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad he's here."
"My father's been haunting me ever since he died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad he's here."
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my son's spirit here... it's as if he never died.
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my son's spirit here... it's as if he never died.
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my daughter's spirit here... it's as if she never died.
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my daughter's spirit here... it's as if she never died.
"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my sister around. It's comforting."
"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my sister around. It's comforting."
"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my brother around. It's comforting."
"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my brother around. It's comforting."
"When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to."
"When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to."
"When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to."
"When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to."
"When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to."
"When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to."
I'm worried about my daughter. I'm keeping an eye on her for a little while before I pass on.
I'm worried about my son. I'm keeping an eye on him for a little while before I pass on.
I know my mother would be worried about me. I'm here to let her know everything's all right.
I know my father would be worried about me. I'm here to let him know everything's all right.
"I worry about my sister. This way I can keep an eye on her, make sure she's not getting into trouble."
"I worry about my brother. This way I can keep an eye on him, make sure he's not getting into trouble."
I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
We got everything in hand here. You aren't needed 'round here.
"We chop trees, we mill the wood. What more would you want to know?"
"It's a hard way to make a living, but we find ways to make ends meet."
We don't take kindly to people snooping around our business.
"These axes can chop a lot more than wood, you know."
"Hey, welcome to the mill!"
"My brother and me bought this place when we left the army. Boy, did we lose a bundle, but at least we're not fighting the war!"
"We're making our money back, bit by bit. Every extra bit of work helps..."
We served our time in the Legion. Now we're just trying to make it day to day.
"I used to serve with Trilf and Steirod. Good guys, but don't get on their bad side, you know?"
I once saw Steirod tear a whole tree out the ground with his bare hands. Glad he's on our side!
These boys do good work for the Empire!
"Nice to be here on the home-front. Wouldn't mind being down in Cyrodiil, though."
Halt. You're under arrest for murder and conspiracy against the city of Markarth!
The [QUOTE]problem[QUOTE] is your disrespect for the laws of this land. It's time to face the Jarl's justice.
"By order of the Jarl, stop right there!"
You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defense?
"Ha, enjoy the Chill."
You'll never see the sun again. No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one.
It's off to Cidhna Mine for you.
You're going to rot in the Dragonsreach Dungeon.
A stretch in the Castle Dour Dungeon will straighten you right out.
I guess you're smarter than you look.
Time to cleanse the Empire of its filth.
Then suffer the Emperor's wrath.
Skyrim has no use for your kind.
Then let me speed your passage to Sovngarde!
Then pay with your blood.
That can be arranged.
So be it.
You aren't fooling me. Trusted witnesses have seen you commit several murders.
And there are accounts of your suspicious behavior throughout the city. Now come quietly.
"Smart man. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course."
"Smart woman. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course."
"Good enough. I'll just confiscate any stolen goods you're carrying, then you're free to go."
"Ah, an excellent question. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Lord of Change, Destruction, and Ambition."
Dagon's Mythic Dawn cult killed the Septim Dynasty and opened the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel. They called it the Oblivion Crisis.
The Razor is Mehrunes Dagon's personal artifact. It has always heralded bloody change and carnage.
"It's held many names: Dagger of the Final Wounds, Bane of the Righteous, the Kingslayer."
The Mythic Dawn worshipped Dagon as a god. Having his Razor would be invaluable to my collection.
Alduin... we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here... you defeated him?
I feared as much. I thought it was him we saw flying east after your battle.
"Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you..."
"There is one possibility. But... no, the Jarl would never agree."
Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace?
Its name is no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.
"Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years ago."
"In those days, dragons could still be found among the remote mountain peaks."
Before the Blades wiped them all out.
"You might be able to trap him there, exactly."
"You'd require the Jarl's cooperation, of course. That might not be easy to come by."
"You must trust in the rightness of your cause, and the strength of your Voice."
"Well, yes. This is rather embarrassing, but it seems I've misplaced something."
"I can't find my Alembic. I suppose I could use another one, but... well, it sounds silly, but mine has sentimental value."
"If you happen to see it, would you mind bringing it to me?"
I seem to have misplaced the book I was reading.
"My Alembic. I need it for some research, and can't seem to find it."
"A book of mine. I was at least halfway through, and wanted to finish it, but apparently I put it down somewhere."
"Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much."
"Deliver the message to the warring parties. If they will listen, I will do what I can to bring them to terms."
We are not warriors. What is overlooked in the Dragonborn is not permitted to any other followers of the Way of the Voice.
"Ah! Dragonsreach! There are many difficulties, but I cannot think of a better plan."
Although I fear the Jarl may not be easy to persuade.
"Remember, the Way of the Voice trains you for more than battle. Indeed, we believe that battle is the least of its uses."
May the strength and truth of your Voice serve you well. Breath and focus.
"I see. The dragon will lead you to Alduin, but without the Jarl's help..."
Paarthurnax has made the decision to help you. This is the road we have to walk.
"Even the Greybeards must bend to the winds of change, it seems."
So be it. Tell Ulfric and General Tullius that the Greybeards wish to speak to them.
We will see if they still remember us.
Aiiiiiiieeeeeeee!!
It's Grelod!
"If you're not sure maybe you don't belong here. I'll ask again, are we clear on all of this?"
"I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all of this?"
Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.
"Very well, I trust that you wouldn't be here were it not significant."
I... see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more... specific explanation.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
"Tolfdir normally looks after your little group, yes?"
"Since he's apparently occupied, and I will need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin researching the subject."
Speak with Urag in the Arcanaeum. See if he is aware of anything that matches your discovery.
"And... good work. The next time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be helpful."
"Damn it, man, are you trying to taunt us?"
"Damn it, woman, are you trying to taunt us?"
"Oh, I... I'm sorry. I just can't... you'll have to speak to my husband."
"Oh, my. You'll want to talk to Enmon about that."
"I thought Enmon and Mean had a little girl, but I haven't seen her in a while."
I think you might be looking for Enmon.
And what's that have to do with me?
"Yeah, we're all looking for something."
Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?
You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation.
I will send word to her family that she is in good hands.
"You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift."
"Hold on, now, we only want to..."
Look out!
"Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy."
An old storeroom. See if you can find some potions. Might come in handy.
"An old storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving."
Hear that?
Come on!
You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed a bit upset at how I've been entertaining their comrades.
Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!
A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense.
"Although, come to think of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there."
Come with us. We need to get out of here.
"You have no authority over me, boy."
Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!
Forget the old man. I'll come with you.
"Grab what you can, and let's go."
"There's no way out that way, you know..."
"Aye, a whole heap of it. You see that Temple? Way up there?"
"All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no."
Not even for a look.
"But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for."
"Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh?"
"Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it."
"You'll be helping out an old beggar, and the Divines smile on that sort of thing."
The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd.
And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all.
The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time.
Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins...
Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.
I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself.
"I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry."
How in the world did that happen?
Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you can use it?
"Hold, mage, and listen well..."
Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped.
"Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing."
"Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with the dangers ahead of you."
This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you.
"You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster."
"Take great care, and know that the Order is watching."
I... I swear I felt something rather strange just then.
What just happened?
I'm afraid I didn't see anything...
Can you tell me more about what you saw?
"It's easy to find things to sell. Things nobody will miss. Things from underground, or just left lying around in someone's house."
"I bet the two of us, we're very alike. So why not take the next step? We can help each other."
My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. We like to collect things.
"As I said, it's easy to find things nobody will miss. My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. You could be too."
Hey! What're you doing in here?
Get out of here or I'll call the guards!
"That's it! You're leaving, right now."
"You look new. I'm new, too. I think we could be friends."
"If you're looking for opportunities to make some coin, well... I'm your man."
"Everyone needs work, right? I have good work for you."
I believe you know what needs to be done. Something about putting out a fire?
Looks like you had no trouble.
Get moving. I'll see if I can't delay any patrols out there.
Of course not! Thieves take what is precious. Thieves steal.
We just take what will not be missed. What no one needs anymore. Maybe we take some weapons and stop a few deaths. Who would call that thievery?
I knew you looked like a clever one...
Turn me in? For what? What crime's been committed? I'm just making idle talk about what would most undoubtedly be a tragic event...
"A tragic, and very, very profitable event."
The effects have already been felt. The Icerunner has failed to dock on time.
"Without the Lighthouse, the Icerunner will have swung wide of the western shoal and run aground on the eastern coast."
My sister Deeja will be at the wreck with our Blackblood Marauders. She knows to expect you.
Don't worry about them. We'll make sure they wash up safe. Maybe they'll even pay us for the heroic rescue from their sad crash.
Hroggar's house? It burned down not too long ago.
It's a real pity about his wife and kid. The screams woke half the town.
Most folk won't go near it now for fear it's cursed.
Do they? How delightful!
I'm lucky to have a man that is so devoted to me.
Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
The townsfolk won't go near it. Superstitious lot.
Hroggar's house fire? Aye. He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?
Hroggar's house fire? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?
It's bad luck to talk about that place.
Jarl's been looking for someone who ain't superstitious though. Be lookin' for a fool if you ask me.
Hroggar claims it was a hearth fire. Some folks say Hroggar started it himself.
"Bear fat in the hearth fire, if you believe Hroggar."
"I do, but some folk here think he set the fire himself."
Hroggar blames his wife for spilling bear fat in the fire.
Many folk think he set the fire himself.
That's what they say.
"See, he's living with Alva now. That started the day after the fire."
"It ain't right, movin' in with a new love the day after your kin die like that."
They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.
He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.
They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.
He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.
Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.
The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.
Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.
The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.
Aye. Our Jarl would sure like to know if he did though. Might even pay to find out.
"Can't prove it. But I could use your help, being unbiased and all."
See if you can find anything in the burned out house.
"I'll pay you to figure it, whether or not he's guilty."
"On rumor and gossip? No. But you, a stranger, might find the truth for us."
Sift through the ashes that others are too fearful to touch. See what they tell you.
"Should you prove him guilty or innocent, I will reward you."
"Susanna's the third. It's always the same: young girl, killed at night, body torn up."
"Same as the others. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart."
"It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade."
"Look, there's a war going on, if you hadn't heard. We barely have enough soldiers to walk the streets, much less patrol every corner."
"If you want to help, ask some of these gawkers if they saw anything useful."
I'm going to examine the body before the rats can get to it.
"Look, friend, if you think you can do better than the legion of guards, be my guest."
"You'll need to talk to Jorleif, though. We can't just let anyone go around claiming to be on official business."
"If he's willing, then we'll talk."
"I'm sorry -- she was very dear to me, and it's rather painful to think about."
"I'd rather not talk about my daughter, if you'll excuse me."
Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?
Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?
I've had enough troubles recently. What is it that you're after?
Good day.
"Hjerim? Well, I'm not sure what you think you'll find there, but you're welcome to have a look."
They say they're too busy with the war -- I say what good is winning a war if we're still terrorized by one of our own?
"Oh, they care all right. Just none of them thinks to do anything about it."
"They say I'm just snooping around bothering people, but I'm trying to save lives!"
"I've been trying to put those up around the city, to warn people. Have them keep their eyes open."
But someone keeps taking them down.
You say you found it in Hjerim? Friga's old place. Let's go have a look around there.
I've got a feeling about this one.
I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets.
Might even give you a bit of gold for it.
"Let me see... ah, yes. This is the Wheelstone. It's an heirloom symbol of the power of Windhelm."
Traditionally it's carried by the court mage.
"I would... eh... be interested in acquiring it. If you're willing to part with it, that is."
"For a piece like that, I could pay... 500 gold?"
"The Wheelstone? Have you decided to sell it, yet?"
Follow me.
I'll meet you over there.
Let's go. I'd rather not stay out here alone any longer than I have to.
Wonderful. This will be a splendid addition to my private collection.
"Wuunferth? Bah. It's purely ceremonial, and he has no use for it."
"Besides, I wouldn't want to be the one to give it to him. Gives me the creeps. They say he dabbles in necromancy."
"Suit yourself. It's only of value to collectors, though. Good luck finding anyone else who will appraise it that highly!"
Wuunferth. There have been rumors swirling about him for years. As long as I can remember.
But he's a dangerous man. It's why they call him [QUOTE]the Unliving.[QUOTE] I wouldn't approach him directly.
This information needs to go straight to the steward. He'll listen to you.
I don't want to believe it. Wuunferth has been a trusted friend to Ulfric for many years.
It pains me to see that the whispers had truth to them.
Wuunferth shall be apprehended. I thank you for your diligence in getting to the bottom of this matter.
The streets of Windhelm are now safe.
What made you think I was to blame in the first place? I've actually been after the killer myself.
More of those things. Bah. Viola Giordano's been putting them all around the city.
"Frankly, whoever keeps taking them down should get a medal."
"Oh, Friga Shatter-Shield's old place?"
"Well, since she's not using it anymore, Ulfric might just let you have it, if you have the money. And if he likes you."
Or you could head over to the family and see if they'll let you in. But I wouldn't want to do that myself. Bad luck over there.
"Doesn't mean anything to me. Got an unusual shine to it, though."
I'd take it to Calixto. He's got a good eye for pieces like that.
"I don't know if I've ever seen any of those before. I've heard about them, though. Sorry, can't help you."
"Sorry, I don't know anything about those kinds of things."
"Not very good quality, is it? Probably came from the Gray Quarter. Have a talk with Revyn Sadri."
He usually knows what's going in and out of that place. Thankfully that means I don't have to.
"Looks like something one of the dark elves would wear. Ask Revyn Sadri, he probably sold whatever it used to be."
"Nothing anybody I know would wear. Maybe ask one of the Dark Elves, they usually have some kind of rag falling off of them."
"The one who sells things, what's his name. Oh, yes! Revyn Sadri. Maybe he'd know something."
"Of course, of course. But such things are valuable, and usually falling apart anyway."
I don't see why someone would actually use them.
Although... that court wizard does all manner of experiments. And I know he owns some truly strange things.
Nobody else would even know which end to hold.
"If I were you, I'd go straight to the steward with this information."
"Oh, good, more of those."
Did you know Viola Giordano wanted to put one of them on my front door?
[QUOTE]Everyone will see it![QUOTE] she said. Of course! That was my problem with it.
"If you want to ask her about them, good luck. But I'm not going near her."
Are you joking? Even I wouldn't sell something like that.
"They definitely have some magic in them, I can tell you that much. But it's nothing I know about."
How goes the investigation?
Any luck finding the Butcher?
"Please, tell me you have good news."
Mmm hmm. Anything else?
Now that's interesting. Tell me more.
Good observation. What else?
"Well, come back when you have some more evidence. I think you're on the trail, though."
That's absurd. Come on now.
"So what do you think about it all, then?"
"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right."
"Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing!"
They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!
"My what, now? I've never kept a journal, I can assure you."
What exactly did this amulet look like?
"I know it well. Or at least, I've heard of it. I would wager that carving once depicted a skull."
"That is the Necromancer's Amulet, of legend."
It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this.
Eehh.. Calixto and his books are often confused about such matters. It happens to the best of us.
I've been noting a pattern to when the killings happen.
"Now that we know they're tied in to some sort of necromantic ritual, I think I know when the next might occur."
Let's see. From a Loredas of Last Seed until a Middas of Heartfire... it will happen soon. Very soon.
Keep watch in the Stone Quarter tomorrow night. That's almost certainly where the killer will strike next.
Oh? I don't expect anyone to miss my meaning.
"Come, Legate. There's much to do."
Mercer? This is the one I was talking about... our new recruit.
"This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf."
"Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich."
"You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions... you do what we say, when we say."
Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.
"Ah, now that's a good idea. Head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think."
"So tell me, did Aringoth enjoy your visit?"
"All eyes are on you, lad. Don't disappoint us."
"All eyes are on you, lass. Don't disappoint us."
Was there something else?
I suggest you listen to what Mercer has to say... if you want in.
"Let me show you the operation, then you can ask your questions."
It's just this way. Keep following me.
"Keep following, it isn't far."
"Go, leave me in peace."
Let's wait until Brynjolf's here before we begin.
"Ah, Borkul muscle one out of you on your way in? Fine. Take this one."
Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named Aringoth.
We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house.
The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground.
That important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.
That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
"They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their one weakness is flame."
"Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften we mean business better than a huge column of smoke."
Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal.
"Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was... well, angry to put it kindly."
So we send in Vex and find out he's hired a bunch of mercenaries to guard the place.
"Hmph, yeah I did. That wood elf s'wit... he's a lot smarter than I expected."
Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard? There must be eight of them in there.
It was like he was daring us to come and get him.
You've made a mess of things and Maven's furious. I told you not to burn more than three of the hives!
"I've smoothed things over with her for now, but you can forget your cut."
"Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lad."
"Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lass."
You did this didn't you? I'll get you for this!
I haven't heard even a scratch at the door. Have you done it?
What is it now? We have a tasting to attend to!
Was something we discussed unclear?
I can't believe that worked.
I can't wait to see Sabjorn squirm.
You're supposed to be at the meadery.
Can't a man drink in peace?
I believe Brynjolf wishes to speak with you. We're done here.
I trust you have good news for me.
Why aren't you at Honningbrew Meadery?
Shouldn't you be on your way to Whiterun?
About time you showed up.
Out with it. What happened at the meadery?
"I'm certain Maven wishes you to be in Whiterun, not wasting time here."
Maven wants to see you right away. I suggest you head right over.
No.... Not again!
No more.... No more!
Don't kill me.... I don't want to die!
I... won't... surrender!
Call... that... a... swing?
You.... You'll pay for this....
I'll never submit!
"Do your worst, monster!"
I won't bend. Never!
I'll see you back in Riverwood.

Let's get out of here.
Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?
"No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks."
"Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon."
"If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it."
Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.
"I just cook, and clean, and do whatever it is they ask of me."
"I can't even keep track of all the people who have been in and out of this fort. They come, they go. I barely notice."
"Hard enough to keep up with who owns this fort. One side takes over, the other runs away. I tell them, [QUOTE]I ain't leaving! I come with the place![QUOTE] Ha!"
"I remember one morning, long time ago, I woke up and the place was run by some Orcs. Went to bed that night, it was all vampires. Don't matter to me."
"Now, then. I been gabbin' long enough. Too much cleanin' to do."
"Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet, loud, quick, slow - whatever you feel is best."
"Occasionally I'll give you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll earn yourself a bonus."
"Me? I like to talk to my targets before the kill. Taunt them, scare them... even challenge them."
"That can have interesting results. Some victims may flee, others may cower in fear."
"If you can goad a target into attacking you first, you may even find any local guards coming to your aid."
Help! Get that beast out of my house!
It's still here! Get it out!
Get that thing out of here!
Thank you! I thought that beast would be the end of me!
No? I daresay we don't have all day.
"Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me here."
I'm not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.
What... What was that? Everything seemed to shimmer for a moment.
What happened?
And here we all are. Shall we step inside?
What could this place be?
Be prepared to defend yourself.
This is simply fascinating.
Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.
Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.
J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins.
Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?
Who knows what we might find in here.
"You know, there might be gold somewhere in here."
"To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed."
"I'm not seeing signs of any warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago."
"This is better than sitting around talking about magic, don't you think?"
"This is exciting, isn't it?"
I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors.
"Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first men in Tamriel, here..."
I'm not so sure we should be here.
I find it hard to believe this excavation was approved.
Don't touch anything!
It's going to take forever to sift through all this.
I'll be amazed if we find anything useful here.
"Well, certainly none of this will benefit my research..."
"Well, are there any questions before we begin?"
"Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds."
I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins.
"Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over."
Find Arniel Gane. He's somewhere in the northern section of the ruins. He'll show you what to do.
"Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do?"
"Brelyna, my dear, why don't you search for warding magics. Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them."
"Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any... residual energies. Alive or undead."
J'zargo... what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs.
"All right, everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun!"
"What? Why? I don't understand... I have done nothing to wrong you. Please, mercy!"
What? You dare challenge Ma'randru-jo? You will suffer for your insolence!
My eyes inside Cidhna Mine tell me that Madanach is dead.
"You've done a great service to the Silver-Blood family. I've had the Jarl officially pardon you, and taken care of a few other loose ends."
"Yes, you're innocent. As innocent as anyone can be in this city."
"I guess we also owe you something for locking you up. Here, my family's ring. And everything the guards confiscated from you."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a mine that needs new workers to fill it."
"Why are you still standing around here? Go get me the Phial, you fool."
"Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus."
This Dwemer lockbox. Look upon it and wonder.
Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me.
"But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone."
"Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away."
The scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it.
For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.
Who do you think brought Septimus here? Who do you think protected you on your journey to open the box and loose my knowledge on this world?
Your free will is an illusion. Whether you acknowledge me or not is your own business. But I will be in your mind.
What do you need?
Here's what I can spare.
Take a look.
Whatever. Just get back to work. Now.
"Now now, brother. Arnoit is just being his usual gloomy self, he didn't mean it, did you Arnoit? You're just being silly again."
What was that?
"You touch her, and I swear it'll be your fingers that go missing, you stupid Breton!"
"Voada, you spilled laundry water in the soup pot again! Do I need to cut off your fingers to teach you a lesson?"
Move it. Get to work. Get to work!
Always another big meal to cook. Figures.
"Right away, sir!"
Filthy natives. Get to work. We have meals to prepare and no time to prepare them!
"Nonsense, you're a vital part of my research team. You'll be there, have no fear! Now, I don't want to hear another word of protest."
"Could I maybe, skip the excavation, Uncle Calcelmo? I, uh, I just think you won't need me."
"The excavation, Aicantar! Right after I finish my book. We'll start excavating Nchuand-Zel again."
"[QUOTE]Next season for sure...[QUOTE] What? Uncle Calcelmo, I don't understand what you mean."
"Next season, nephew. Next season for sure...."
Stop bothering me Aicanter!
Are you sure?
"Just a man's life work, is all. I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but this doting busybody won't let me get it."
"Now, how would you like me to align the Phial's properties?"
"I'm not as skilled as Curalmil, so I'm afraid it will only ever refill with one type of liquid."
It's just one of those things that happens. The lungs just... give up. Even elves get old.
What's it matter to you? Not like you could do anything about it.
"Um, no. Nothing. Nothing at all."
I just wanted to know if you needed anything.
What is it nephew? Can't you see I'm trying to think here?
Uncle Calcelmo....
Your job is to do what I say. And I say you have many nails and fittings to make before you even touch a blade. Now get to work.
When will I learn how to forge weapons and armor? Isn't that my job?
You thought what? You would skip a step? Not heat the metal all the way through? Useless! Now do it again.
"I... I'm sorry. I just, well, the forge gets so hot and I thought...."
Is that what you call it? In the Legion we would have called it [QUOTE]useless.[QUOTE] Look how brittle the metal is!
"Uh, a nail?"
Tacitus? What is this?
"Yes, Thongvor. I'll draft the letter immediately."
"Whose side are you on, Reburrus? I'm not worried about Skyrim, I'm worried about the Reach. Specifically, the part of the Reach we're standing on."
"Thongvor, do you really think that's wise? I mean, King Ulfric is such a busy man, and there are so many areas of Skyrim to protect."
Ha! About time we got some more muscle in this city.
"Reburrus, I need you to draft a letter to Ulfric requesting more men."
"Yes, Thongvor."
"The Forsworn aren't our real concern, defeating the Imperials and making sure we keep control of this city is."
"Well yes, of course you had to go and mention that."
Except the ones attacked by Forsworn.
"Very well, Thongvor. With the Stormcloaks here to help, the Silver-Blood family control nearly every route in and out of the city."
How goes the trade in and out of the city?
"I see. Well, let's continue this discussion later then."
"I, uh, I can't tell Thongvor. It's anyone's guess."
What does that mean Reberrus? Are we winning or aren't we?
"Oh, right. Oh, well, things are going well enough. At least, as well as we can hope."
"Oh, Talos's breath, Reberrus. Skip ahead to the good part."
"I have a few very detailed missives from border patrols, beginning with Fifth Irregulars' reports on the movements of...."
I want word on our campaign against the Imperials.
"Yes, my Jarl."
"Yes, my Jarl."
"Enough! We can't imprison the very people that own the jail we would be throwing them into. The Silver-Blood family are to be left alone, am I clear?"
"I second that, Igmund. Who knows what that family will do for power? They could be working with the Forsworn, for all we know."
Loyal? Thongvor supports Ulfric and his Stormcloaks! We should imprison the entire family as a precaution.
What about them? They seem loyal enough.
"Igmund, we need to talk about the Silver-Blood family."
"Cowards, the both of you. My father would not sit idly back and wait while evil men take over his lands. We're done discussing this for now."
"The safety of the city and our settlements must be our only concern, Igmund. The rest of the Reach is on its own."
And what do Legion soldiers know about the hills the Reach? And the caves that make up those hills? The Forsworn can hide and ambush every assault.
This is why I say we take the fight to them. Gather the Legion and drive those blasted beasts out of the Reach for good.
"Things are bad, Igmund. Our forces are barely able to keep the Forsworn in check. Merchants are reporting the loss of more of their shipments."
"Raerek, how is The Reach faring against this Forsworn menace?"
Very well. I'll send a request for additional Legionnaires to protect trade to the other Imperial holds. Hopefully Solitude can spare more men.
"Forgive me for worrying about the future of Markarth. The lifeblood of a city is gold, Igmund, and it doesn't stop bleeding because there's a war on."
"Why do you pester me with battles we can't win? I need my steward to plan for our victory, not nag me with every ill account."
Not to mention the rebels completely control Windhelm and all of Eastmarch hold.
"Of course there's a collapse in trade, Raerek. The Stormcloaks stalk every road and harass every one of our patrols."
"My Jarl, we need to discuss the state of Markarth's collapsing trade with the other holds."
Too bad. That one's my favorite.
"I don't buy that story, either."
Fell off the top of the cliff after a drunken party with the priestesses of Dibella.
You're lying. You're not quick enough to be a pickpocket. What's the real reason?
"Mining accident, back when I was in prison for being a pickpocket."
"How did you manage to cripple yourself, Degaine?"
"And I'm a porter with no shipments coming in. You're not getting any coin from me, Degaine."
I'm a cripple. I have a reason to be drinking.
Like you won't do different?
"Give us a coin, Cosnach. You'll just spend it on cheap ale, anyway."
Sometimes I think we deserve these miserable lives of ours.
Mmmhmm.
"[QUOTE]Mmmhmm[QUOTE]? I've been working with you for over 10 years, and all you have to say is [QUOTE]mmmhmm[QUOTE]?"
Mmmhmm.
Another foul day at the smelter.
Don't be. We all make mistakes.
"I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
I have one. A nephew. He's in prison for being a member of the Forsworn.
I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me if you don't....
"Oh. Oh, I see...."
I was actually just wondering if you had any family....
"You want to know a secret of mine, young girl? The most effective poison to kill a man? A potion to make others fall in love, perhaps?"
"Bothela, I have a question...."
"You will. Until then, you'll taste every potion you make before you sell it."
There's just so much to memorize. How am I supposed to remember what goes where for every single herb?
"No, no girl. It's the pickled spider tongue and then the decayed taproot. Do it the other way, and your cure turns into a poison."
"You're right, dear. I'm sorry to worry you."
"Endon, dear, please don't.... Save your frustrations for work."
"I miss those days, before the Forsworn took up arms again, when you could walk the roads in peace."
"Well, I'm proud of both of you. I haven't been so busy since those nobles from Solitude come into the city three years ago."
Adara bends the silver so naturally. Grandmother would have cried if she saw how deft our daughter has become.
"That's right! Papa helped me with the clasps, but I did all the links on my own."
We sold all those lovely little necklaces you brought me today. Did you make them yourself?
"If there's still a Legion left, Adara. I'm sure you'd make a great soldier. Just like your brother."
Can I join the Legion when I grow up?
"No. I think if I was a young man, I would have done the same."
"Endon, we talked about this... Are you still disappointed in Cade's choice?"
"Our son joining the Stormcloaks. If this war had never happened, Cade would have joined the Imperial Legion, like grandfather."
"He's off fighting, Adara, with the Stormcloaks. He'll return when the war is over."
"Mama, when is Cade coming home?"
Good to hear. You can be a difficult man to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
Good to hear. You can be a difficult woman to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
No you aren't.
That's just terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that.
"What are you, blind? That store is empty. Forsworn get almost every shipment that comes in."
"I wasn't aware that Lisbet was having trouble, Cosnach. Is Arnleif and Sons not doing a good turn of business these days?"
"All your drinks are watered down, Kleppr. You aren't fooling me, and you know Lisbet can't afford to pay me enough for the finest drinks anyhow."
"Another drink, Cosnach? A porter with Arnleif and Sons deserves nothing but the finest here."
"Always such a model for decency in these troubled times, Yngvar."
"Shut it, Kleppr. Thongvor isn't here, so save your kissing up for a Nord who cares."
"Ah, Yngvar, here to sing? You know an employee of the Silver-Blood family is always a guest of honor here."
That's a sensible lad. Now fetch me drink.
"Uh, right. Maybe just one of the popular songs, like [QUOTE]The Slaying of the Falmer Princes[QUOTE]?"
"Son, I know thousands of the old ballads. If I played all of them, everyone in this inn would be as grey as I am before I finished."
"Playing tonight, Ogmund? Everyone here is anxious to hear the old ballads performed by the True Skald of the Reach."
Have you seen that Shrine of Azura? They say the dark elves built it after they fled from Morrowind. Sight to see.
We are children of the Twilight. Beings who are to be guided from the darkness into the light. And from the light into darkness.
Azura. Who led her children away from the disaster of Vvardenfell. You are the prophet that reveals our true future.
"No harm shall come to me, for I live under Azura's wisdom. Her foresight protects me. Her insight sustains me."
"My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago."
Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came.
This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget that she watches over us all.
"Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future."
"But I refuse to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance."
Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion.
Do not fight it. Azura's prophecies always come to pass. To deny them is to go headlong into the darkness with no light to guide you.
"Well, I've certainly heard worse things."
"I think the man you want to talk to is Nelacar. He was exiled a few years ago, bad research. Still hangs around the Frozen Hearth."
You were given a vision? Are you serious?
"Whatever. The person you probably want is Nelacar. He's in the Frozen Hearth. Be careful, he was exiled from the College for a reason."
No. I wouldn't.
"Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one."
"Vision? What vision are you talking about? Oh, no matter."
"You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back."
You should go into town and talk to an elf named Nelacar. He was involved in the whole mess.
"Yes, I did. I shouldn't be the one to tell you about this. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. Believe me, he'll know."
"Oh no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not being blamed for saying something out of place. Again."
"If you want to know, ask Nelacar. He's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Knows the whole sad story."
"Almost the opposite. The College got rid of something... someone, that was too much trouble."
There's an Altmer named Nelacar staying at the inn outside the College. You should ask him about it.
"Azura? Gods, it's all finally coming back to haunt me."
You're working with the Daedra? Right. Now tell me the one about the Argonian Maid and the lusty baron.
A few coins for my soul? If only you understood the irony.
I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions.
Just calm down. I'll tell you everything.
Do you think muscling me is going to work? I'm a wizard. An old. Elven. Wizard. Think about it.
That's for the best.
What do you know about soul gems?
They are. Except the gem is always consumed. They're frail. Except for one.
"That's what caused all the trouble. Soul gems are used in enchanting, but they break afterwards. Except one."
Azura's Star. A Daedric artifact that allows any number of souls to pass through it.
"Some of us wanted to find out how. I was working under Malyn Varen, then. If only we knew what he was really planning."
"Soul gems are the subject, friend. They're used in enchanting, then they break. Except one."
The Great War... only thirty years past and already ancient history to most people.
Seems to me like it just ended... it's never really ended for me.
"But to answer your question, the White-Gold Concordat was the fancy name they put on the peace treaty between the Empire and the Thalmor."
It ended the war and saved the Empire to fight another day.
"Also trampled on the sacred name of Talos, and gave the Thalmor free reign to stamp out Talos worship throughout the Empire."
"No, not right now. Maybe later, if I'm still upset."
Are you going to walk over to father and start hitting him again?
Aren't you wonderful! Why can't your father be more like you and your sister?
I've been cleaning up spills and there is fresh linen for the rooms.
"How are your chores coming, son?"
"Dibella's Heart, son, I hope not."
Will I need to talk so loudly with my wife when I get married?
"We don't fight, son. We, um, talk. Loudly."
"Father, why do you and mother fight so much?"
"Never mind your mother, Hreinn. You listen to me, and you'll be a great man one day."
That's right! Worst innkeeper in all of Skyrim!
But mother says you're a terrible innkeeper!
"Ah, my son, you'll be a fine innkeeper someday, like your father."
"Today I've cleaned the linens, washed the floors, and checked in on all our guests."
"How are your chores coming, my son?"
I am your better half. And your better half is telling you to stop being an idiot and serve the customers their drinks!
"Shouldn't you be helping me then, wife of mine? Sharing my problems? Being my better half?"
You were just standing there when you were supposed to be serving drinks to our customers!
What? What did I do this time? I was just standing here!
"Kleppr, you idiot! Can't you do anything right?"
"No, just check in the guests and manage the coin and keep a roof over your head. No, nothing important."
Clean the rooms yourself Kleppr. It's not like you do anything important around here.
"Frabbi, my dear loving wife, could you please clean out our guest rooms?"
"Not a day goes by I don't ask that question myself, my dear."
"You're an idiot, Kleppr. Why did I ever marry you?"
"Don't worry, my love. Just show the bugs your adoring face, and they'll scurry away in complete fear in no time."
Assur had to move away because of the Empire. But we get to stay.
The mages don't let us go in the College. They said it's not safe in there.
"Assur says his pa says the College made lots of bad things happen, but the mages I've seen look nice."
Assur and I are playing a game. Don't tell him where I am!
"There's not many people left in Winterhold, so I only have Assur to play with, and sometimes he's mean."
Assur always wants to play [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] and he makes me be the Elf.
"Pa says the Empire made us leave, but the Empire just does whatever the elves tell them to."
How come you're in Winterhold? My pa says people like you are the reason no one lives here anymore.
We don't get many people like you visiting Winterhold. Usually it's elves.
My pa says elves are bad and not to trust 'em.
Did you know that most of Winterhold fell into the sea? I heard it's because of that College.
Someday I'm gonna grow up and be the Jarl.
I heard the College teaches you how to kill people with magic. Is that true?
"I'm just the Housecarl. If you need something, you should speak to Kraldar."
"I'm very busy, you know. I'm the only one Kraldar can rely on to assist him."
Kraldar's family was once very powerful in Winterhold. It's my honor to assist him even now.
Kraldar has big plans for Winterhold. We'd be better off if he was in charge.
Some people can't be trusted to accomplish anything that's asked of them. They don't take pride in their work.
"I'm not one to complain, but I'm not sure why Kraldar insists on keeping Malur Seloth around."
"My job is to serve the Jarl, not waste time talking with travelers."
"Thonjolf is convinced I've got some connections at the College, so he goes easy on me."
I don't really know anyone at the College. I guess everyone just assumes I do because I'm a Dunmer.
"People won't say it, but they're afraid of me, so they leave me alone."
"It turns out that if people think you're some sort of secret wizard, they'll let you get away with a lot."
I'm trying to do as little as possible. You're getting in the way of that.
"With the Empire's help, Winterhold will be back on its feet in no time."
There's yet hope that our relationship with the College can be repaired.
"Winterhold may not look impressive, but it has a very rich history."
"Winterhold was once the capital of Skyrim, you know. Quite an honor."
I'd like nothing more than to see Winterhold regain its former glory.
"It's hard to recover from something like the Great Collapse, but I believe Winterhold can do it."
"The College of Winterhold is truly an asset to our city... err, town."
"I have a very close relationship with Savos Aren, the current Arch-Mage."
Just say the word if you need a drink or something to eat.
"We may not have as much to offer as Whiterun or Solitude, but we'll do what we can to make your stay a pleasant one."
"Winterhold doesn't offer much, but we like living here. Been here all our lives."
"If you're here for the College, don't let the folks in town bother you. Just try and keep to yourself."
"The Mages at the College keep to themselves for the most part, so we don't see much of them."
Most of our business comes from folks traveling to and from the College.
"If you need a drink, just say the word."
Something I can get for you?
Turns out who runs Winterhold doesn't change much. Can't say I'm surprised.
"I won't complain about Korir being gone, but I don't expect things to really be any different."
"If there's anything you need, just let me know."
"If you've business with the College, you're welcome to stay here. It's where most of our business comes from, in fact."
"Unlike some folks here in town, we have nothing against the College or the people that come and go."
"Don't worry about Nelacar. He has a permanent room here at the Inn, but he keeps to himself and doesn't cause any trouble."
Let me know if you need anything. We're here to provide.
"Without us looking out for Winterhold, it's doomed. Simply doomed."
I'd rather see the Sea of Ghosts swallow Winterhold entirely than have it run by the Empire.
Ours is the only family left that truly cares what happens to Winterhold.
"Korir will be the first to tell you that if it weren't for that College, we'd all be better off. I agree with him."
Winterhold might yet thrive if that College had never been built.
"We do the best we can, even though we have next to nothing. But we Nords don't give up, not ever."
"Assur is going to grow up to be a great man, because he'll have lived through such hardship."
"Driven out of my own home. After all this, I can't believe it."
"It wasn't enough that the College still stands, now the damnable Empire has Winterhold. I hope they all freeze to death."
"I don't care how many Colleges they build, or how much the sea swallows up. I'll outlast them all."
You know Winterhold used to be the seat of power in Skyrim? Now it's a shell.
"Few will admit it, but we know the truth about the Great Collapse."
Those cursed mages... It's their fault Winterhold is gone.
"The College is the worst thing that's ever happened to Winterhold, maybe to Skyrim."
What is it now?
You want something?
"Empire's in charge now, huh? Only a matter of time before we start getting bothered by them Thalmoricars... err, Justimors... Y'know, them elves."
"Unless you're bringin' me another round, you can just keep walking."
"I'm just trying to have a quiet drink here, all right?"
It's not like there's anything to do here but drink anyway.
"You ask me, not enough of Winterhold fell off into the sea."
Nothing to do here but drink till you forget you got nothing to do.
"I'll sell just about anything, if it's worth my time. Keep that in mind, will you?"
"I do what's necessary so we can get by. Have to, since I can't count on my brother for anything."
Things are easier now that I don't have to worry about Ranmir anymore.
I still can't believe you were able to help Ranmir pull himself together.
"Without all our money going to drink, I can afford to expand my selection a bit."
"If you're looking for Ranmir, he's either passed out in bed, or working on winding up that way."
My brother's a good-for-nothing drunk. We'd have lost the house by now if it were up to him.
Just because we live in the middle of nowhere doesn't give Ranmir the right to drink himself into oblivion.
"Ranmir has no problem drinking himself under the table, so I have to be the one to make ends meet."
"I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother asking."
"My days at the College are long behind me, but I prefer to stay close by."
"Dagur and I have an understanding. He gives me privacy, and I make sure my experiments don't blow up his inn."
"If you're here for sight-seeing, well then you've seen the sights. Might as well head somewhere warmer."
Don't worry about those Stormcloaks. You're safe from them here. As if they'd want the place anyway.
"Keep clear of the College, and keep yourself out of trouble."
Hard to believe I ever complained about Riften being cold...
Take care if you're venturing too far from town. That's a bitter wind coming off the Sea of Ghosts.
"Winterhold belongs to Skyrim, not the Imperials, or the Mages."
It's rotten because the wood is cheap and its soaked with ale! Now we'll have to replace all the furniture before bugs set in.
"I don't know, my darling wife. I assume you're going to tell me?"
"All the wood furniture in this inn is rotting to the core. Do you know why that is, Kleppr?"
Indeed. I... I thought you captured the Butcher.
"You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?"
Obviously. You should visit the Bloodworks to talk to Wuunferth -- we need to figure out where the evidence went wrong.
"Oh, isn't that a shame. And here I am in the Bloodworks."
Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.
I'm glad you were able to correct your mistake. I'll release Wuunferth immediately.
"Ysmir's beard! The man was always a bit odd, but I wouldn't have expected..."
We should keep moving.
We need to get back to Jorrvaskr.
There you are.
A smart man came and told us about a blade piece.
"Skjor thinks you should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you."
One of those icebrains who wanders the land getting people's hopes up.
"From my view, I don't think we'll find anything here."
"You'd better hope there's still a chance for you to prove yourself, though, or this Trial might last longer than you'd like."
He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you.
"He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get him."
And he's right.
She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.
"He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire."
"The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself."
"He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of Skyrim."
"Apparently so many people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the client."
"He's an Argonian layabout, likes to scavenge shipwrecks. My guess is he'll run if threatened. Or swim, if given the chance."
"He's an accomplished wizard. And, locating him may be challenging, as he travels with the caravans."
"The wood elf may run a stall in the city, but he retreats to the plains outside Whiterun to hunt. Kill him there, and no one will bear witness..."
"She's a maid. Old, and feeble. But with this contract it's much more a matter of [QUOTE]where[QUOTE] than [QUOTE]who.[QUOTE]"
"Your political affairs are your own, but any allegiance you may have in the ongoing war could very well affect your access to Fort Greymoor."
He's dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into Dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared.
Just not by you.
He's the housecarl of Falkreath. You know what that means? He's the bodyguard to the Jarl himself. So be careful.
"Ah, yes. The pirate captain. A ruthless she-devil, by all accounts. Deadly with a blade."
"And let's not forget her crew - loyal and bloodthirsty, the lot of them."
"This is my final contract, and certainly the most challenging. Be careful with this one, my friend."
"No! Oh, by the gods, please no!"
"Oh... Oh no... Please, please... I ain't never harmed no one... Old Narfi just wants to be left alone..."
"Do... do you want something? Look, if you ain't gonna talk, or spare no coin, just go away..."
What? What do you mean?
Oh! Oh... no... No!
Aiiiiiiiieeeeee!
"Who are you? You... you're with the Dark Brotherhood, ain'tcha? I knew it. I knew you'd come for me!"
"And let me guess, that someone is my so-called husband Leigelf? Well the feeling's mutual."
"What? Well, we'll see about that now, won't we?"
"I've a mine to run, so if you'll excuse me..."
"Well then, you won't be leaving here alive!"
"Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us meet as equals."
"Hmph. Don't say much, but there's a strange aura about you. You walk in the shadow of death..."
Leave here. Leave here and never return.
"Ha! Oh, that's a good one, friend. Killing Lurbuk... I mean, can you even imagine something so ludicrous? Depriving the world of my unique talents?"
Hmm... All right... How about this?
"Shadows creep, and... and phantoms leap! A man got... he got scared. And the demons dared! To um... visit upon him all which they feared!"
"Brilliant, I know. It's a gift."
"What's the matter, friend? Khajiit got your tongue? Maybe you need a little ditty to loosen your gob, hmm?"
"There once was a stranger, with eyes full of danger, he spoke not a word, but his meaning was heard... Sing on, sweet Lurbuk, sing on!"
You'll have to catch me first!
"Go away! I don't know who you are, but this is my spot! Whatever's on that ship is mine!"
"And why would you be looking for me, hmm? I'm not sure I appreciate your presence here. Friend."
"Now aren't you a strange one. Well, if you're here to shop, shop. If not, find some other caravan to stalk."
Are you... threatening me? Walk away fool. It's not worth it.
"Is that so? We shall see, villain. We shall see!"
"Well now, you are a strange one. You remind me a bit of myself, when I'm stalking a deer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that..."
"But I have many more rooms to clean. Fort Greymoor is quite large, and rather filthy if I do say."
Sleep? I can't sleep now! There's too much to be done. And what's this Void you're rambling on about?
"I swear, you people are an odd bunch. Please, just step aside, that I may return to my duties!"
"Death? Oh, there's death to be found here, to be sure."
But not my own!
Yes... quite. But if that power could be harnessed. Controlled. The possibilities would be...
But... who exactly are you? And why are you in here? I think it best you leave Mzinchaleft. These ruins can be quite... dangerous.
Who are you? Why are you here? Leave this place. I have much work to conduct....
"And why would I... Oh. Oh! Guards! Guards, I need assistance!"
Fiend! You will not leave here alive! Guards! Guards!
"Right. Well. If you have some kind of official business with the jarl, I'm afraid now's not the time. Go on then. Off with you."
"The Dark Brotherhood? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think this is the first contract I've had on my life?"
"I'm a pirate, sweetie. Assassination attempts are an occupational hazard. Now, shall we?"
"Sithis? Let me guess: [QUOTE]In the Void![QUOTE] By the gods, you Dark Brotherhood are a predictable lot, aren't you?"
"Okay, here's how this works. You try to assassinate me, and I kill you. Horribly. I have done this dance before, you know."
"Ah, I see. The old Dark Brotherhood [QUOTE]silent intimidation[QUOTE] treatment."
"Oh, I know who you are. Don't be so surprised. You ain't the first assassin sent to kill me. Won't be the last. Now let's get this over with."
I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others.
On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of Unmelting Snow. No heat can touch it.
"Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how."
The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach.
"If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole."
You've shown yourself useful so far. All these lunks are too afraid of Haldyn to head in before the fog's cleared.
"So if you're willing to perform one more service for the Company, we could put this matter behind us for good."
"Take out Haldyn, and we'll handle the rest."
The one who calls himself Ancano.
"He seeks information about the Eye, but what he will find shall be quite different."
"His path will cross yours in time, but first you must find that which you need."
"No, though you may be the last. The one who calls himself Ancano has sought my knowledge as well, through very different questions."
"Your path differs from most. You are being guided, pushed towards something."
"It is a good path, one untraveled by many. It is a path that can save your College. I will tell you what you need to know to follow it further."
"You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware."
"To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff."
"Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage."
Ainethach's in charge of Karthwasten. You should bother him.
What do you want? Can't people leave us alone?
Strangers are nothing but trouble.
Karthwasten has enough problems. Leave us alone.
"Ainethach's dead, but that doesn't mean we can stop working."
I work in the mines. I hunt. Everything else I do is my business.
These Reach folk are so... nosy.
Ragnar has a strong arm. Pity he isn't an Orc.
"Finally, both of my mines are open again. Time for everyone to get back to work."
"If the Forsworn aren't attacking my town, the Nords are trying to force me off it."
I'm one of the few native sons of the Reach that owns land. It doesn't make me very popular.
Ainethach is dead. What will happen to Karthwasten now?
I'm Ainethach's right-hand man. I help supervise the mines.
"Not many Nords would work for a Reachman, but Ainethach is a good man."
The good mine is closed and the other mine has no ore. Gods have cursed me.
Sauranach mine is open again. How am I supposed to handle all this work?
"You're not from here, and we don't need to be talking."
You should talk to Ainethach. He's in charge.
"Don't have nothing to say to you, stranger."
Karthwasten doesn't need outsiders prying in our business.
The mine is closed. Get lost.
I've been sent by Silver-Bloods to keep this mine [QUOTE]safe.[QUOTE]
Our business is done here.
We're in control of this mine. No sudden moves.
Time to find another job.
Make them all pay for what they've done to me...
I'm not going to warn you again.
Once more and I'm going to have to kill you.
Don't do that again. Last warning.
You're pushing your luck.
What's the matter with you?
Stop that.
Watch it!
"Hey, be careful!"
I'm on your side!
What are you doing?
So you don't know anything about this house?
No.
Anyone seen entering or leaving? Any strange lights or unusual noises?
That's quite an accusation. I assume you have proof?
"Can't stop to chat, citizen."
No time to talk. Out of my way.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Is that so?
We'll see about that.
I've got my hands full with something. Don't go far. I'll need you soon.
I'm in the middle of something. But don't go far. I'll need you soon.
Good. I can use someone I can trust.
Excellent. I have a couple tasks for you.
Good. I have some things that need doing.
Good. I'm spread thin. I could use the help.
Got my hands full as usual.
There's plenty that needs doing.
I'm disappointed in your failure. But the Empire still needs you. I'll have to over look it for now.
Turns out you're a screw up like the rest. But I still need you. So I'll overlook it for now.
"With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately."
"Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection."
"You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor."
"To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting."
"There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor."
"Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun."
"Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up."
The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.
"I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple."
Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?
These dreams are manifestations created by the Daedric Lord Vaermina.
"She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness."
I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.
Wonderful! My lady Mara will be quite pleased!
"Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry."
Your concerns are understandable; trust is a very difficult commodity to come by these days.
I can only give you my word as a priest of Mara that my intentions are honorable.
Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire... a nightmarish land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways.
"From her citadel at the center, she reaches forth to collect our memories, leaving nothing in return apart from visions of horror and despair."
Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for the memories of others.
"The Skull has been out of touch for so long, I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to feed."
What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an argument for scholars and historians to this very day.
You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and with your own body.
Those around you will perceive you as normal and you will find the words you utter may not be your own.
"Thanks to all of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate as to whether this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina."
"I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back."
"Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled."
"Unless you're here to solve this nightmare problem, I don't need you."
Need a room? Don't worry. Nightmares don't seem to happen for travelers.
You come to Dawnstar at a bad time. Tempers are... fiery.
The Jarl is... tired. Be mindful of that.
These dreams are real I tell you. Real!
Can't sleep well no matter how much drink I put in me.
I envy you travelers. Dreams aren't affecting anyone not from here.
What is it? I haven't had much sleep.
"If I get any rest soon, I'll count myself richer than a king."
"If you're here about the nightmares, I'm afraid my pleas to the College of Winterhold go unheard."
"Seems like no one is getting a decent night's rest in Dawnstar, stranger. Best buy your steel and move on."
Gods I'm so tired.
"Please. I must remain uninterrupted if I am to complete the ritual. Have no fear, your time will come."
"What troubles you, my son?"
"What troubles you, my daughter?"
"Yes, my son, what is it I can help with?"
"Yes, my daughter, what is it I can help with?"
"You're wrong to come here, stranger. No rest in Dawnstar."
"By the Divines, I'm tired."
"No. I don't have anything for bad dreams, so don't ask."
Lady Mara will save us from these nightmares. You'll see.
"Wish to converse with the crazy old elf, eh? Very well. Go on."
Apologies accepted. I understand how this entire story can be mistaken for fiction since the circumstances are so abstract.
"However, I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to keep you safe if you're willing to help me."
"Amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to continue my research. I have no time for idle chatter with any simpleton who strikes up a conversation."
Thank Mara. I was afraid I'd never be able to convince you.
"Allow me to gather the materials I need for my ritual, and then I will meet you outside the ruins."
Let me take a look...
Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier to the inner sanctum.
It involves a recipe for a liquid known as Vaermina's Torpor.
"I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed there, we should be able to locate a sample."
Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma was released.
"Impossible actually. Hmm, I wonder..."
"There may be a way to bypass the barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done."
"I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move on."
"Farewell, Brother Casimir."
Go now! The orcs could breach the inner sanctum at any moment!
"Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives if necessary."
"And what about you, Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?"
Then it's decided.
"Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you."
"Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!"
Agreed. To the death.
We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina.
"The Miasma? But, brother..."
Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.
"But... no more than a handful of us remain, brother."
We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.
"The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren."
These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.
Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.
There goes another one.
Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.
"They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible."
"As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be."
You hear that? The others must have found something!
We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few minutes.
"All right, please stay close to me while we're inside. It should be safe, but it's always better to be cautious."
"Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full.  Here's the key to the shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next level."
I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood.
"In the southwest reaches of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view."
"When questioned by the Black Door, answer with the correct passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE] Then you're in. And your new life begins."
I'll see you at home.
"The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She goes by many names."
"Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you believe that sort of thing."
"Today, she's... well, she's a skeleton. An ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought to this Sanctuary by her Keeper."
"Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we stopped following those years ago."
"All those rules, all that discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit."
"Bottom line - respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into place."
"They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers."
"The Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client."
"But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor."
"But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual... and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out."
"I don't know who you are, or what's going on here, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
"What's happening? Damn it, what are you doing?"
Get these things off of me!
Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For shame!
"By the gods, when I get out of here you're dead! You hear me? Dead!"
Aggghh! Re...lease me!
"Thank you! Thank you! I won't tell anyone what happened here, I swear it!"
"Oh, gods, please! Let me live! I'll do anything you want!"
"I... I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done nothing to you."
"Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen! It wasn't my fault, I swear!"
I'm just a soldier. Killing is my job! Surely you can't fault a man for doing his job?
"Please, oh please, I don't want to die..."
"Ah, sweet freedom. Now that's more like it. You have my thanks, stranger."
"Whoever this is, clearly we got off on the wrong foot. Ah, but no worries. This is not the first time I have been bagged and dragged."
"Come now. Whatever the problem, we can talk about it like civilized folk. Hmm?"
"Hello? Hello? Ah, I know you're listening."
A man in my position makes lots of enemies. But what is a life-threatening situation if not an opportunity for mutual benefit? Hmmm?
You'll let me go. I know you will. This is all just part of the game we play...
Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil.
"The Night Mother's crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation."
"I don't know where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon."
Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been closed.
"Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived for so long."
"My only worry is her [QUOTE]Keeper.[QUOTE] I'm not sure what Cicero expects to gain by bringing the Night Mother here, but he'll soon learn this is my Sanctuary."
Molag Bal. You think you can best Boethiah's faithful? I have won this contest before!
"Ah. But I have my own champion this time, Logrolf."
What? You!
"Mortal. I give you my mace, in all its rusted spitefulness."
Crush the spirit from Logrolf's bones. Make him bend to me.
"No more.... No more.... I submit, Molag Bal. I submit!"
Don't know what that man expects. House is empty.
Untie me. Now.
No.... Not again!
No more.... No more!
Don't kill me.... I don't want to die!
I... won't... surrender!
Call... that... a... swing?
You'll pay for this....
I'll never submit!
"Do your worst, monster!"
I won't bend. Never!
"Good. Wipe them out. So long as one of them is left alive, they will come for me!"
What? How? I thought they weren't allowed within the city!
"At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough."
Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do.
"For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare."
"Assassins? No, nothing so crass."
"[QUOTE]Saadia[QUOTE], as you know her, is wanted by the noble houses of Taneth for treason. We were hired to see her returned to Hammerfell for her crimes."
"You can help us with that, and make sure no one else gets hurt."
"I'd hoped we could work something out, that you would see reason."
That we could avoid having to kill you.
"Very well, then. If that's the way you want to play it, we will."
"She trusts you, at least to some extent. She sent you after us, and has no reason to think that you'd do anything other than that."
"Convince her that we'll be coming for her, and she needs to leave. Lead her to the stables outside Whiterun."
We'll be waiting to take her into custody.
I'll gladly share a portion of the bounty in return for your efforts in seeing proper justice done.
Good. We'll be waiting for you at the stables.
It will be good to finally be able to return home.
Would you look at that!
Don't rush ahead. This is a trap if I ever saw one.
I hope your stay in Markarth treats you better.
Need to get going. What is it?
New to Markarth?
I'm shopping. Excuse me.
Oh it's you. The one from the market.
"I'm sorry, I'm still a bit dizzy from everything."
The Treasury House is really just for patrons of the Silver-Blood family. You don't belong here.
I'm sorry. We're only interested in helping our patrons.
I work for the Silver-Bloods. Help clean.
Just here to work.
Looks like you weren't followed. Good.
"Once you've found out anything, come straight to me."
City's got eyes. Be careful when you're out there.
"I'm sorry, but you're not leaving alive."
Let me know as soon as you've found anything.
Be careful who you talk to.
Keep your eyes and ears open.
I should never have come to Markarth.
What's happening to this city?
This has ruined my entire day.
This is it! Gathrik awaits us!
What are you on about? Let's just get the treasure here and go.
Some nights I dream about the mists of Sovngarde.
"When you get to be my age, you'll come to miss the smell of blood. Strange, I know."
"How goes the hunting, brother?"
"How goes the hunting, sister?"
A stranger comes to our hall.
"Greetings outsider. If you have some business here, speak it."
Are you still here?
Let's not waste too much time talking when there is glory to be had.
Get a move on.
Haven't seen your face before. I'm watching you.
"This is a place for warriors, new blood. What brings you here?"
"You still need to prove yourself, whelp."
You might make a decent Companion yet.
Are you looking for help with something? This is a busy time.
This had better be important.
You again?
What now?
I can't keep helping you with everything.
Blood on the wind today. Good hunt ahead of us.
"Do you have guidance for me, Harbinger?"
I've been running interference for you around here. I don't think anyone's caught on to our little campaign. Yet.
"Have you been bringing the battle to the Silver Hand, friend? I wish I could be there with you. Soon enough."
"I hope the hunting goes well, sister. We've got the cowards on their heels now."
"I hope the hunting goes well, brother. We've got the cowards on their heels now."
I've heard you may actually be stronger than you look. Perhaps we can hunt together someday.
"Don't let them intimidate you, sister. We both know how to keep our heads while the men let their hearts rule."
It's good to have another quick-eyed Shield-Sister in the hall. Come to me with any troubles.
"If you wish to hunt with me, your feet need to be quick, and your eyes quicker."
Ysgramor himself wouldn't have the patience to deal with all the rabble around here.
Are you on the hunt?
Blood running hot?
You look strong. Come to Jorrvaskr and be a Companion!
"Vilkas said you are the new Kodlak. I don't know what that means, but you seem honorable, so that's good."
"Skjor says that I have the strength of Ysgramor, and my brother has his smarts."
"Some people don't think I'm smart. Those people get my fist. But you, I like."
You are new here. I don't trust the new.
My brother Vilkas is a better talker than me. He should be around someplace.
I'm here to help.
Thinking I need to train some more.
Getting tired of hanging around talking all day.
"I wouldn't have expected someone like you to be the Harbinger, but Kodlak trusted your judgment. And so will I."
Come to me with questions. I know our history almost as well as Vignar by now. Except I can remember it.
What brings you to me? Find some strange creature in your travels?
I think by now I've killed one of every living thing in Skyrim. May be time for a trip to Morrowind.
"Great, another ambitious visitor. You think you can just wander in here and join us?"
Did you just wander in out of the white?
I suppose you have another question?
What is it now?
"You're a talkative one, aren't you."
"I swear, every wanderer who shows up in Whiterun looks weaker than the last."
"I always thought the new Harbinger would be taller, myself."
"Ah, fresh blood. Hope you know how to handle yourself."
I never thought they would actually let me join the Companions. But now it looks like they're letting anyone in these days.
I avoid going to Eastmarch if I can. Something in the air... I think it's just too close to the border.
"Are you thinking you're better than me? I crawled west out of the wasteland, so show some respect."
"We are all Ashlanders now, brother. Good to find another family that cares where they came from, eh?"
To what do I owe the honor?
"Look, I've got training to get to."
You don't belong here. What do you think you have to offer?
I'm still trying to figure out why Skjor let you in in the first place.
"If the Circle vouches for you, I'm sworn to respect their judgment. But that doesn't mean I like it."
What guidance could you offer me?
What now?
"Oh, it's you."
Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.
"Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room."
"I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!"
"Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?"
"Good to have some fresh eyes up there at the top. I follow your lead, Harbinger."
"Oh, got more to say?"
What's on your mind?
"Oh, so you're the one in charge now? Fine, fine."
I haven't seen you before. Have I? Have we met? I'm sorry if I've forgotten.
"The latest recruit! Right? Wait, is that right?"
Might head down to the meadery later. See what they're brewing up. You can smell the honey on the wind.
"What do you want from me, now?"
"You're a talker, eh?"
I don't think we're going to get those potatoes to come in.
"Well of course, not with an attitude like that!"
The ground is practically frozen. We can't dig down far enough.
"Come on, we just need a little elbow grease."
"Now, I've been reading about the best ways to grow corn in permafrost..."
"I keep telling you, without a warming enchantment, it will never grow past your ankles."
"Right, but if you plow the soil with fire salts..."
Then you've salted it and nothing will grow at all. Genius.
"Oh dear, I hadn't thought of that."
"I'll bet this is better than trying to grow something in Morrowind, though, isn't it?"
"Firstly, I've never even seen Morrowind. Secondly, in volcanic soil the plants practically grow themselves."
"Oh, my, I hadn't thought of that."
"There are places in the world that aren't wrapped in ice, you know."
"I was wondering if you had ordered the shipment of that frostwheat, sir."
"Yes, but that fool Endario can't get it in. I'll thrash him when I get back to the city, don't you worry."
"I wasn't wanting to get anyone in trouble, sir. Just wanting to get the new planting started, is all."
"Yes, wouldn't want to miss the lush summer we have ahead."
Make sure the back fence is repaired. I swear I saw some skeevers in nibbling the leaves yesterday.
"Oh, no skeevers out here, sir. They can't stand the cold."
"Maybe, but the way you burn through all that wood to keep the cabin toasty, they might mistake this place for Elsweyr."
"Sorry, sir. These old bones do like a bit of warmth in the evening. There's no need to make fun."
"You just need to remember that there's a war on, and firewood isn't cheap these days."
So have you ever actually spoken to Captain Lonely-Gale?
"By the gods, he's just a retired ship's captain."
"Maybe to you, but he's just so... his story is..."
"He's just a guard captain. And not a very good one, at that."
How have things been with you?
I got another harangue from Torsten yesterday.
"Don't worry about him. I know you work hard, and I'm the one who gets you your money."
"Thank you, miss, I appreciate that."
And what about the dogs? How are those precious little angels?
"Healthy and strong. Ysgramor's coat's gotten so thick, he looks fat!"
"Oh, that's just adorable."
Tulvur! I've just completed inspection of the farmhouse.
Oh?
"It's filthy in there! Dirt everywhere, and it looks like the dogs have the run of the place."
"Well, sir, it's a farmhouse. It's not going to be as clean as your house in the city."
"I just know that our sailors are able to keep their ship quarters clean, and I expect the same of you."
"I'll do my best, sir."
"Sir, I'm going to need some better equipment if you want me plowing the frost."
Like what?
"Well, some tools that aren't rusted through would be a start."
I'll provide you wood and timber to make whatever riggings you'll need.
"I'm not building a ship, sir. I'm trying to make things grow."
Did I tell you I got a letter from General Tullius? They've conscripted some more archers and will need...
Sssssh! That's not something we want everyone to be hearing.
"Oh, like the sleepy rebel supporters in this town are going to tell anyone."
Let's just not take the chance. We can talk about this later.
That last brigade of soldiers said there's a tall forest on the eastern edge of the White River.
"Yes, but that's too close to Mixwater Mill. We don't want to get Gilfre angry at us by stealing her trees."
Well we have to harvest somewhere! This is getting absurd.
"I want to make money just as much as you do, but we don't want to make the Nords angry."
Who could tell the difference?
We've got a new order in.
Is that a joke?
No! Roggi and Kjeld need some more support timbers for the mine.
I suppose Kjeld asked for the usual discount?
"Well, he is the mayor."
"No, it's fine. I don't mind being poor."
What about Ulfric? Did you ever hear back from him?
"No, but his housecarl sent us a letter."
Why didn't you tell me? What did he say?
"He... thanked us for contacting him, but said they didn't need any more lumber at the moment."
Oh.
You see? That's why I didn't tell you!
There is some good news though. I think the borders of the shrine may be smaller than we think.
"Wait, so you think we'll be able to harvest some of the sacred trees up there?"
Well that's just it. Some of them might not be sacred.
I'll let you explain that one to the Nords.
They have to be reasonable about it at some point.
Gemma. This town is called [QUOTE]Kynesgrove.[QUOTE] That stand of trees is Kyne's Grove. You don't honestly think you can just cut some down.
"Well, we have to cut down something!"
Maybe we should just admit that this is a horrible place for a mill.
I'll never understand why you're so bitter about everything.
I'm bitter because we had lives in Cyrodiil. And we came out here to be paupers.
But we choose our own path now.
And a whole lot of good that's gotten us.
"Mama, when can we go play in the river again?"
"Not with all those soldiers all over the hold. Their horses can't see you, you know."
"I know, but..."
And you'll be trampled to death!
Please take the Lexicon.
It's yours now. I won't take it back. I won't.
Avanchnzel. Take it to Avanchnzel. You must take it back.
No way. I'm quick!
Well why don't you be quick about finding my book that you lost?
You need to take better care of your sister.
But she's so stupid!
She said you threw her into a goat pen yesterday.
Because she was being stupid!
Don't make me bring your father into this.
I'm going to need your help in the kitchen tomorrow.
But papa was going to take me hunting tomorrow!
"Oh, I don't think you're old enough for that yet. You can help me salt the cheese curd."
Why can't Froa do it?
Because I'm telling you to.
"Papa, mama's making me do kitchen work again."
And what did you say to that?
She can't tell me what to do!
"There you go, son. Be your own man!"
And then I told her about the vampires and how much they would pay me for her.
That is rich. What did she do?
She's a girl. She cried.
It's good to toughen her up. Not an easy world out here. Keep at it.
When do I get to go hunting?
Miss Grelod is... well she's a terrible old crone. No person could be that cruel. I think she's part hagraven.
She only lets us out in the yard once. In the morning. And she just stands there watching us.
Like I said. Hagraven.
"Sometimes, when she goes to her room to work or sleep, I slip out for a bit. Noontime, every day - that's when I hit the streets."
"A boy's gotta make a livin', right?"
I hate her. Everyone hates her. She's the meanest person I ever met. Sometimes she even locks us in the... room.
"Constance tries to stop her, and is real good to us, but it's never enough."
"I ain't afraid of the old hag. Still, I wish Constance was in charge. She treats us real good."
"Constance, sometimes she gives me little snacks. Which is good, 'cause we only get but one meal. Late, too, in the afternoon."
I'm a growing boy. I need as much food as I can get.
"I will do nothing of the sort. You have no business here. I'm sorry, but you really must leave."
When you're able to draw a bow all the way to your shoulder.
I can do that! I did it yesterday!
"Oh, really?"
So can I come?
We'll see.
Have you heard about Goldenglow Meadery?
Did something happen to it?
All the apiaries... it will take years to get those bees happy again.
Do the bees need to be happy?
Of course! You can't make good mead without happy honey!
"If you like mead so much, why not go live in Riften?"
"Oh, I wouldn't be able to help them. Their skills were given by the Divines."
Maybe you could be a taster or something.
"Ah, but I can do that right here. Right now!"
How are the little ones?
"Oh, you know. Little Kjeld is a handful, and Froa is just so quiet."
"He takes after his father, and she takes after you."
"Well, that's the good and the bad of it."
I'm not sure that's a good joke to tell with women present...
But don't you get it? She thought he was a troll!
I get it. It's funny. It just might upset your wife.
"Eh, let her get upset. She'll be angry no matter what I say, might as well enjoy myself."
"So, Roggi, when are you going to get yourself a woman?"
"Oh, I'm not sure I could ever settle down like you have, friend."
Who says I've settled down?
I think this is yet another conversation that wouldn't make your wife happy.
"That's just it... if she's not happy, there are plenty of other women who will be."
"Oh, you old charmer."
How much do you know about the brewing of mead?
"I know all there is to know about the drinking of it, and that suits me just fine."
I've been trying to figure out what makes Riften mead better than the stuff from Whiterun.
Better honey?
"There has to be more to it than that, though. I wish I knew where the bees got it from."
I hear Mauhulakh is wandering again. He's after a new woman.
He's lonely. What do you expect?
No matter. You'll take care of things like you always have.
"Please, let's not have it come to that."
True... we could simply make sure she never reaches Narzulbur.
That wasn't what I meant.
"If he does show up with a bride, we'll have to move quickly."
"Once she's with child, I will not harm her."
Is there... something else you need?
"You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well, I have!"
"Yes, you've made that quite clear in the past. And now we have Urog and Dushnamub because of your weakness."
"They are good, loyal children."
"Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will not speak? To anyone!"
"Yes, you. You, who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient bones. I give you this task - journey to Volunruud. Speak with Amaund Motierre."
What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's coffin! Explain yourself!
"Speak, worm!"
She... spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie! The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener!
And there is... no... Listener!
They squander their father's love. We can't dally this time.
Have you scried anything new in the entrails?
She... she said that? She said those words... to you?  [QUOTE]Darkness rises when silence dies[QUOTE]?
But those are the words. The Binding Words. Written in the Keeping Tomes. The signal so I would know. Mother's only way of talking to sweet Cicero...
Then... it is true! She is back! Our Lady is back! She has chosen a Listener! She has chosen you! Ha ha ha! All hail the Listener!
Very little. It's an uncertain time.
"Not for us, it isn't."
For all of us.
Come back to me when you have something useful.
He's been spending a lot of time at the graves again.
"Good. The more time he pines for the dead wives, the less time he spends finding a new one."
Be careful. The spirits can speak to the living if there's a strong connection.
"Excellent. Now, you must come with me. You've become a part of this. You must be present for the ritual."
"In a Daedra, of course."
"Now, we begin the ritual..."
Why are we bothering with this?
You pathetic weakling!
What's that?
"You dare summon me, Yamarz?"
What? What is this?
Bah. He never had a connection with any of them beyond what his loins told him.
"You don't deserve to call yourself an Orc! You're weak, you're small, and you're an embarrassment!"
"You let giants... Giants!... overrun my shrine. Bring me their leader's club as an offering, and I might release you from this curse!"
"So it will be. Malacath has spoken, Yamarz. Your path is clear."
"Very well. You, outsider, come here! I want a word."
"This is all your fault, you know."
"I'm stuck fighting a giant now, thanks to you. So you're going to help me."
"You're going with me, and you're going to make sure I don't have any trouble reaching that giant."
"Don't worry, I'll make it worth your while."
"Thanks to you, I've just been issued a challenge in front of my whole tribe, by a Daedric Prince, no less. I can't ignore that."
I didn't say I wouldn't fight the giant. I just said you're going to help me get to it.
"Meet me outside Fallowstone Cave. You clear the way to the giant for me, and I'll make sure you get paid for it."
This giant... It's not the only thing in Fallowstone Cave. Getting to it isn't going to be easy.
"You're going to clear a path to the giant, so I can conserve my strength. I'll make sure you're paid for it."
"So you meet me at Fallowstone Cave, and we'll get this over with. I can have my tribe back, and you can... You can leave us alone."
"If there's a chance this will save me, then I'm taking it."
"I'll lead the way, but you'd better back me up."
Let's get this over with.
"Maybe, but..."
"We're the ones he loves. Me, and you."
"Bolar, I must ask you something."
"Yes, child?"
Have the spirits told you where I may find a wife? One who will be safe from this curse?
"Oh, all things in time, my boy. All things in time."
What more do you need that Yatul and I cannot provide?
"First off, we've learned the location of some rebels scouting our positions throughout the hold. Need to take them out."
"First off, there's a couple of Imperials skulking about the hold. Need to cut their throats so they can't make their reports."
"First off, they've got some rebels holed up in a nearby settlement. Need to clean them out so our boys can move in."
"First off, there's a band of Imperials hiding in a nearby village. We're going to flush them out and put them to the sword."
"First, we need to limit Stormcloak capacity and send them a not so subtle message by sabotaging a resource they claim to control."
First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.
"First, we have information regarding the movements of a rebel courier. We need to intercept him and confiscate his package."
"First, we've learnt the whereabouts of an Imperial cur fetching documents for his master in Solitude. We need to put a muzzle on that, don't we?"
"First of all, one of our men was captured by rebels who refuse to surrender him. So we're going to break him out."
"First of all, a son of Skyrim rots in an Imperial prison. We'll be getting him out of there soon."
"First of all, I need to sew confusion and doubt through the rebel troops. I want to assassinate their commanding officer."
"First, if we can assassinate their commander, we'll be able to strike them while they're busy tucking their tails between their legs."
"First, our intelligence suggests one of the rebel garrisons has become disaffected. If we play our cards right, we should be able to turn them."
"First off, we hear a group of Imperial legionnaires are coming around to our way of thinking. With a little encouragement they'll join our side."
"First off, seems the Jarl's Steward might be vulnerable to blackmail. Need to investigate that possibility."
"First off, it seems that we might be able to blackmail the Jarl's Steward. I need to find out for sure."
"First on my list, is a problem with our supply caravans being constantly harassed by a giant. Need to deal with that hairy brute. And soon."
The last few supply caravans have been attacked... by a giant. As if I didn't have enough to deal with. Need that damn hairy brute straightened out.
"First, I need to get a handle on rebel operations. Need to discretely liberate some documents from their headquarters."
"First, I need to know what the Imperials are planning. Need to slip into their headquarters, grab plans, maps, something useful like that."
"First of all, I'd like to drum up some more support from the local populace. I have someone in mind."
"First of all, there's someone in particular I'd like to win over to our cause."
"First off, there's an Orc hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with."
"First off, there's a damn Orc hanging around getting in the way. He's been yammering on about needing help with some kind of vision quest."
"First, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. We aim to confiscate it from the rebels."
"First, we're attacking the fort. I want that fort."
...
...
"Secondly, some rebel scouts that have seen too much are moving through the hold. Need to take them out before they report back to their leaders."
"Secondly, we got a couple of Imperial spies roaming through the hold. Need to put an end to that."
"Secondly, we got more of 'em hiding in a village, using the local populace as shields. Not to worry. We can dispatch them without harming the locals."
"Secondly, we plan on liberating a settlement from Imperial hands."
"Secondly, I need to cripple rebel production capabilities with a little sabotage."
"Next problem - Imperial thieves have, yet again, stolen an important resource.  So we're gonna take it from them permanently - by destroying it."
"Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents."
"And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back."
"And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort."
"And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?"
"And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray."
We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.
And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.
And we hear a handful of Imperials are realizing they are Stormcloaks at heart. We need to send them a little encouragement.
"Next, I need a little investigating to confirm the possibility of blackmailing the Jarl's Steward."
"Next, I need dirt on the Jarl's Steward. Heard there's blackmail potential there."
And then there's a tiny problem with a giant that's been raiding our supply caravans... You heard me right. A giant. Need to put a stop to that.
And then there's a tiny problem with a giant attacking our supply caravans. A giant! As if I didn't have enough to deal with.
I also would like to get a handle on what the rebels are planning - slip into their headquarters and steal their war plans.
"Also, I need a peek inside Imperial headquarters, ideally lifting some documents detailing their plans. I need to know what to concentrate on."
Then there's a little matter of some recruiting. I have someone in mind I'd like to join our campaign.
I need to send someone out to do a little recruiting. There's someone in particular I'd like to join us.
And then there's this Orc who's been hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.
"And as if that wasn't enough. I got this damn Orc hanging around, getting in the way, yapping about needing help with some kind of vision quest."
"Secondly, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. I want to gain a fortified position here before we launch our final attack on the capital."
"Secondly, I want to take the fort here. Having a fortified position will make it easier for us to amass men for our ultimate attack on the capital."
...
...
I need more children.
I surrender! I surrender!
"Well, that's a different matter..."
Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore.
"Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed. Here, take it."
"Then I thank you for showing me mercy. Here, take this coin to him. If it keeps us together, it's worth its weight."
"Wha... what? Oh, it's one of you people."
"So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?"
"Petty threats and fist waving are not going to sway me. You people are all talk, and everyone knows it!"
Pay you to protect me? You can't even protect yourselves!
"Likewise. Now, I have a lot to do, so I'm afraid you'll just have to leave!"
Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are run out of Riften.
I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city.
"Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!"
"I knew when we were married, this would come between us one day. I don't want to lose what we have, so I'll pay him gladly."
You... you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?
What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get blood from a stone.
"Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be reasonable. I'll... I'll pay next month."
Are the gods angry with me?
And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the sewer.
You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you people a single coin.
"Despite your mistakes, I see more potential in you than half the snot-nosed footpads that stumble their way into the Flagon."
I'm going to put my neck on the line. We need people like you in our outfit.
"Judging from how well you handled those shopkeepers, I'd say you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you in our outfit."
What's on your mind?
"We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned about."
Tell you what. You keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?
I look forward to it.
The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.
"It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. Stick it in, give it a twist, and the stuff will just flow out."
The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.
It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam.
Eldergleam's sanctuary grove is to the east of here.
You can use Nettlebane to retrieve some of its sap.
"Shall we proceed, friend?"
Thank you for your kindness.
I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.
Why do you ask me that?
Why else have they cursed me? Killed all my wives?
Perhaps it's actually a sign of their love for you. They don't want to see you with unworthy mates.
Then they should send one they consider worthy.
"Patience, boy."
"Don't you ever wonder, father?"
All the time.
But your aunts don't even seem to care.
They are good women. They love me. You will speak no more ill of them.
I've just never heard of a midwife losing all her mothers like that.
"Father, I'm worried about Gadba and Mul."
What about them?
"If Ulfric's making a move for Whiterun, then we need to be there to stop him."
"Draft another letter with the usual platitudes, but this time share some of your intelligence regarding Ulfric's plans. Embellish if you have to."
We'll let it seem like it's his idea.
"Yes, sir."
You Nords and your bloody sense of honor.
Sir.
You don't worry about two Orc men coming into your stronghold? That they might challenge you?
They're miners. Harmless.
I've just learned not to trust luck around here.
"Someday, you can have your own stronghold."
I think it may have to be far away from here.
"Oh, if you're worried about me trying to meddle with you..."
It's not you I'm worried about.
How is your hunting with Yatul?
We are strong. We get the job done.
I'm proud of you for helping provide for us.
Well someone has to provide around here.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
I was apprenticed to Balimund before he died. He taught me everything I know about forging armor and weapons.
"Balimund pulled me out of Grelod's orphanage when I was just a child. I don't know what he saw in me, but I was glad to get out of there."
"I've spent years watching his techniques and learning his tricks. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be as talented as he was."
"Catchy, isn't it?"
In my youth I was a fisherman... I had a beautiful ship named [QUOTE]The Brawny Prawn.[QUOTE] But the years have a way of creeping up on you.
"I ended up selling that ship to open this place. Seemed only fitting to name it after her. Well, changed it a bit I suppose."
"If I had been smarter, I would have kept my boat. Coming to this city was a big mistake."
Would you mind helping me with the demonstration? Are you at all familiar with ward spells?
"Well, then this should be no problem at all for you."
That's what this lesson is for. Perfect time to try it out.
"That's all right. I can teach you a very basic ward, one that's enough for the purposes of this lesson."
"Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you, and you block it with the ward. Here we go."
Shhh!
Leave me alone.
I'm trying to pay attention.
"After I've finished showing you the grounds, we can talk."
Welcome to the College.
How do you think we should spend the remainder of our classroom time?
"If you have any further questions, can you please hold them until I've finished?"
Greetings. Welcome to the College of Winterhold.
"If it's true, and you do have the Voice, would you mind showing me? I've never seen it first-hand."
Much knowledge lies within the College's walls.
"The College is an asset to Skyrim, even if it goes unnoticed or unappreciated."
"Winterhold's glory days may lie behind it, but the College lives on."
"No matter what, the College will endure."
"I don't know what your aunts told you, but..."
They're not my aunts. They're your aunts. And they told me enough.
What are you talking about?
About how the Divines cursed you. What horrible thing did you do to deserve it?
Nothing! I... it's ill fortune. That's all.
"Well, your ill fortune means I have no mother."
What I am doing is none of your business!
Why are you here? Did you follow me?
I demand that you leave at once and never speak of this again.
"It is none of your concern, I assure you. Just... Forget that you ever saw me here."
"I am under no obligation to tell you anything. Now, leave me at once and never mention that you saw me."
Is that so?
"I should have expected as much. Fine, I shall give you 200 gold, and you shall leave me in peace."
"Now go, leave me to my work."
Thank you. I will not forget this.
"Ah, Falion. Always looking where he shouldn't for things he doesn't need."
What has he done now?
I've never trusted him... what has he done?
I... I'm sorry.
Haven't I always been a good father? A good chief?
Yatul and I do all the hunting. Mul and Gadba do all the mining. It seems like all you do is find more wives to get killed.
"That's not fair, now."
"Ah, so it is not just dreams then. I have seen this."
I will see that it is dealt with. Thank you for bringing clarity.
"Is that so? Well, I'll make sure that's taken care of immediately."
It's good that you brought this to my attention.
"I see. If something does happen, you know where I am."
"Either this is some kind of a joke, or you're keeping something from me."
"Whichever it is, I don't like it."
"Falion, I am disappointed."
"I'm told that you're up to something out in the marsh, Falion."
What is the meaning of this?
"You've been exploring places you shouldn't, and you know it."
I don't even want to know what it is you've been doing.
"It stops at once, or else there will be consequences of an unpleasant nature. Do you understand?"
"It doesn't happen again, or else I'll have you thrown in jail. Clear?"
"I... Yes, I understand."
"There's a... A problem, yes."
"I'm worried about Idgrod, and I don't know what to do."
"Yes, but... not so loud!"
Will you take it to Captain Aldis?
"She's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse."
I've looked after her safety for so long...
"If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead Hjaalmarch?"
"Yes, I suppose there is."
"There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered."
"I cannot leave Idgrod's side, so I must stay here. Could you see that it reaches Captain Aldis in Solitude?"
For me? From whom?
"Well now, that is something. Hand it over, please."
I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.
"But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the Thieves Guild where it hurts."
Now you're speaking my language.
"Tell you what. If you need any stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good money for them."
Consider me your new friend in the north.
"Oh, no. I hadn't heard from Gorm for a while, so I'd hoped he'd given up on his little scheme."
The last time we'd discussed this issue was before this damnable war broke out. Things were different then.
"Now, what's he's asking, it's just impossible. Even if it worked, the questions and accusations it would cause..."
"Well, I'll take it under advisement. Thank you."
Look here. There's something strange about this cabinet.
What's it say?
"These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts."
"My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary."
"I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well."
"All right, then."
I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here.
"Helgird's taken the body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies."
Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed.
"Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giordano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down."
Ask her about it if you want an earful.
"I've been following him for months now. Well, not actually following. Trying to find him."
The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.
Just... try and keep out of our way.
"Bolar has been in a bad mood for weeks, now."
Oh? I hadn't noticed.
"Since Galka was taken from us. She's been... sad, I guess."
She's just worried about you. We all are. We just want you to be happy. We want to make you happy.
You wanted to see me?
Bolar said you had been looking for a new wife?
"Well, I..."
I don't think you're quite ready yet.
How will I know when I'm ready?
"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear."
"Please... How long must I do this? I keep praying, Night Mother. Why won't you answer me?"
"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear."
So... very tired...
"Grelod, you old crone. You'll get what you deserve. The Dark Brotherhood will see to that..."
"Die, Grelod! Die!"
Bolar and I will tell you.
How much longer do we have to work this backwoods mine?
"A bit longer, yet. We need more money if we want to be chiefs of our own."
But I thought there was only one chief.
"Well, right. One of us will be a chief."
What about the other one?
Which other one?
The other chief!
There's only one chief!
I found a big load of ebony at the bottom pocket in the mine.
I can't believe it's come to this.
I really thought you'd be able to save me.
"Please, let's hurry."
Let's get to the stables before they find me.
Any news of the Alik'r?
"Please, we need to speak in private."
What are you looking at?
Can you help me find someone? There's gold in it for you.
We're looking for someone. Maybe you can help.
I have some questions for you. I'm trying to find someone.
The Alik'r are not permitted within the city walls.
"You're not one of those Alik'r thugs, are you?"
"By decree of the Jarl, the Alik'r are banned from Whiterun."
Do you have news of our quarry?
Thank you for your trust. I am eager to return to my homeland.
"A woman -- a foreigner in these lands. Redguard, like us."
She is likely not using her true name. We will pay for any information regarding her location.
"We are not welcome here in Whiterun, so we will be in Rorikstead if you learn anything."
"We're looking for information about a woman -- a foreigner in these lands. She's a Redguard, like us."
"We believe she may be hiding in Whiterun, but we're checking everywhere to be sure."
Are you sure?
Oh no! They've found me? I need your help!
"Please, come with me. I need to speak to you privately."
"The who? I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about."
We're looking for a fugitive who comes from Hammerfell. A Redguard woman. She may be somewhere in this city.
No. There are too many people around. Come with me.
"I've told you, we can't talk out in the open. Come with me."
So the Alik'r know where I am? What did they offer you? Gold? How many more of them are coming?
Tell me!
"You have a death wish, then? If you know that name, you must know to meet him would be to meet your end."
"But it seems we both have needs, friend. Perhaps we can help each other out."
"You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know."
"I have dishonored my brothers by being captured, and so they have left me here."
"My life with the Alik'r is over now, but I have no wish to die in this gods-forsaken land. If I can be released from prison, I may start over."
"See to that, and I'll tell you what you want to know."
"100 gold will secure my release. You can afford that, can't you?"
"I suppose you'd better hope you can, if you want the information."
"Get the money into the hands of one of these guards, and I'll tell you what you want to know."
Very well.
Kematu is west of Whiterun. It's an unassuming little cave called Swindler's Den.
"You realize if you set foot in there, you're never coming back out. They'll kill you."
"But that's your problem, not mine."
Then we have nothing more to say to one another.
Because I was clumsy enough to be captured.
Kematu always says we're supposed to be the best of the best. I wasn't.
Then I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.
You can't tell them!
"Please, I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city."
I am not the person that the people of Whiterun think I am. My real name is Iman. I am a noble of House Suda in Hammerfell.
"The men who are looking for me, the Alik'r, they are assassins in the employ of the Aldmeri Dominion. They wish to exchange my blood for gold."
I need you to root them out and drive them away before they find me and drag me back to Hammerfell for an execution.
"There will be. Of that, you can be assured."
"Of course, sent by... what is it that she's calling herself these days? Shazra? Saadia? One of those, correct?"
"Did she appeal to your sense of honor? Your greed? A more... base need, perhaps? It doesn't matter."
"No doubt she's convinced you that she's the victim. But, do you know why we pursue her?"
Just like always -- nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.
"I heard a scream and came running, but she was already... like this... when I got here."
"Sorry. I thought I saw a fellow running away, but didn't get a good look at him."
"Eehhh... no. Sorry. But I did notice that her coinpurse was still intact, so whoever did this wasn't after gold."
"I'm going to keep preparing the body, if you'll excuse me."
"Another girl killed. This is Susanna, from Candlehearth Hall."
Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.
To the east of here is a hidden grove where the Eldergleam resides. It's the oldest living thing in Skyrim. Maybe all of Tamriel.
Our tree here in the city was grown from a cutting of that tree. You can still feel the glory of the mother tree through it.
Even its name is an echo.
"Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I said sorry, yes?"
"Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear it."
I'll already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!
"Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what we're all about."
"Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's seen to that."
"Good, and take this little message back to your bosses."
I'm not paying any of you a single septim... ever! Now get out of my inn!
"With the rumors going around about how poorly your Guild's been doing, she's become much too bold."
I'm not that foolish. The last thing I want is a war with your people.
"Look, I'm only telling you this because I care for her. Don't mistake this as acceptance for what you do."
"Keerava has some family at a farm just inside of Morrowind. If you mention you know about it, she might just listen to you."
"Just please, don't harm anyone. I couldn't bear the thought."
"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical..."
"In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic."
"I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?"
Did you mark it?
"No, I don't need to mark it. I remember it."
Someone has killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!
Yay!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Aventus really did it! He got the Dark Brotherhood to kill old Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Hooray!
"We love you, Dark Brotherhood! Ha ha ha ha ha!"
So where is it?
You can tell it because it has lots of ebony.
Do you ever get a weird feeling about those sisters?
Who has a sister?
Mauhulakh's aunts. You know... the way they're all around him all the time.
"Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you."
"That's just how it is with families. When we're chiefs, you'll see how it is."
Can we both be chiefs?
"Not today, we can't."
Sometimes I think your head is made of rocks.
"That would be good! I could use it to smash other rocks. Easier to mine, then."
"Oh, good point. I wish my head were made of rocks."
"Come, child, I will tell you how to track a snow cat."
But you said that was impossible.
"No, just very difficult. You have to look for shift in various shades of white."
My eyes are sharp.
"They are, but your mind has to be sharp, too."
Cough Cough
Cough
What's the most dangerous beast you've ever killed?
"Oh, probably a troll."
They're fearsome!
"They are indeed. Nothing like your mother, though!"
That's what everyone keeps saying. But you didn't kill her. That's what I was asking.
Oh of course. My mistake.
What about my father? Was he a good hunter?
"It's a wonderful house, my love. If you don't mind, I'm going to start a small store. Something to do whenever you're on the road."
You have quite a house. I'm thinking of setting up a small store here. Sell odds and ends.
"Strange house, but strong. Solid. I think I'll open a store. A task to tend to whenever you're away."
"This house of yours is wondrous, at least to these eyes. I've thought about starting a store. Something to do here when you're out."
"This house is huge. I'll be tripping my feet all over this place. Hey, I think I'll start a little business here. Something to do, you know?"
"I've seen bigger houses, but it's yours, so I like it. Now, I think I need something to do if you're ever away, so I'll be opening a store."
"A good house. You chose well. I don't like sitting still, so I've decided to open a store. Buy and sell whatever is needed."
"Hello, my love. Back from some adventure I bet."
"It's good to see you again, dear."
It's pleasing to see you again.
"Ah, it's my love, come to visit."
"Hello, dear. I haven't been drinking too much, if that's what you're thinking."
"You and I, we're the only people in Skyrim worth loving. That's what I think."
"Good to see you, dear."
"Yes, my love? What do you need?"
"Do you need anything, my love?"
"Speak. You can ask anything of me, love."
"Is there anything you need, dearest?"
"I love you. You know that, right?"
"What do you need, love? Ask anything."
"Yes, love?"
"Oh, you've seen your father just trying to chase a skeever from his house. He's a bit soft."
Sometimes I'm surprised he's still the chief.
"We all are, my dear, but sometimes the Divines reward those who don't seem to deserve it. Call it dumb luck."
Why are you looking at me like that?
"The Dark Brotherh... Oh. Oh! I... my goodness, you're really here! The Black Sacrament. It actually worked?"
Isn't there some business you should be tending to?
"If you can... I want you to kill someone else, as well. You don't have to - not as part of our deal. But if you do... I'll pay you even more."
"It's Nilsine Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm. If Nilsine dies, too... I'll make it worth your while."
What I need? What I need is for Alain Dufont to die! I want him hunted down and murdered like the dog he is!
What?
Alain is... is dead?
"I... I'm grateful. It's just this... this isn't at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I was considering more, and..."
"Ah, well. Dead is dead. Right? My thanks to you, assassin. Here's the gold I was going to pay for the job. You earned it, after all."
"Excellent. Once Alain is dead, I'll pay you. In gold. I've saved up a bit. I hope that'll do."
"But, well... There is one more thing. If you're interested?"
"I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear friends, and... in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered..."
"I met Alain in the tavern, while I was... drinking my sadness away. He was handsome, and charming. He said I was the [QUOTE]beautiful lily[QUOTE] of his dreams."
"Alain made all the pain just... go away. But it was all lies! Alain used me. He ruined my name, destroyed my friendship with the Shatter-Shields..."
"Do you know why Alain was in Windhelm? He heard about Friga's murder. He wanted to befriend the family, in their grief... and rob them blind."
Alain used me to get close to my friends. And now they all think I'm some kind of... monster. Alain Dufont took my life. And now I'm taking his.
"Well, what news? Is Alain..."
That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
"But last I heard, Nilsine is still alive. So I guess you decided not to kill her as well. I have to admit... I'm disappointed."
"Here's the payment for killing Alain. And nothing for letting Nilsine live. Just remember, that was your decision."
Thank you. That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
"And... I heard about Nilsine. You have more than fulfilled your part of the bargain. Please, take this - as payment, and a symbol of my affection."
I'll never forget you.
"Ah, you're back. So, how went your first real contract? A bit more exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager."
"Of course, dear. Of course. And, from what my little ravens tell me, you handled yourself quite well."
"Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature."
"Oh, very good. Very good indeed. You, my dear, are going to fit in here quite nicely..."
"Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature."
Very well. I respect your discretion.
"Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature."
"If you're looking for a room, you want the Four Shields."
You look like you've seen your share of adventure.
It's no easy thing to make a living in the wilds of Skyrim.
Don't see many travelers out this way.
"This land's tough and unforgiving, but beautiful, too."
You hear all this talk about a war? I hope it never comes here.
Seen some mean-spirited folk pass through lately. Thought I was rid of those sorts when I left Markarth.
"Welcome, traveler. Mind yourself in our town."
"We aren't a big city like Solitude or Markarth, but we like it this way."
"If it weren't for Michel, I'd probably be dead in a Markarth gutter by now."
"Got a loving wife, a healthy son and a patch of land to call my own. What more could a man ask for?"
"Are you a soldier? One day, I'm going to be a soldier!"
"Pa says I'm too young to fight in the war, but I can still help by patrolling the town."
I wish I was a soldier! They get to travel and stay up late and have fun!
"Have you met Lucky? He's my pet goat, and he helps me patrol the town."
I'm hoping to run my own inn someday.
Faida's teaching me the innkeeper's trade. She runs the Four Shields.
Please stop looking at me like that.
First the war and now there's talk of dragons. What's next?
"Working hard gives a man reason for drinking hard! Well, that and putting up with a wife like mine."
"You're a well-traveled sort, I can tell just looking at you."
You been to Markarth? They've got a tavern called the Silver-Blood Inn. Best ale this side of Skyrim.
Money's been tight since the mill burned down. My wife won't let me forget it.
"They say a strong drink, a sharp axe and a good woman are all a Nord needs to be happy. Two out of three's not bad."
Rest a spell! Can't work every minute of your life.
Where is that lazy man?
"You going to try and sell me something? Well, I ain't interested."
Did my worthless husband send you?
Got nothing to say to strange folk.
"Keep walking, stranger."
"Got nothing to spare for travelers nor refugees, here."
"If you're looking for handouts, look somewhere else."
"You want anything in this life, you gotta take it. Just not from me."
Faida's the name. I keep the inn.
"Something different about you, I can tell. Hope you ain't here to cause trouble."
"The meals I serve ain't what I'd call a Jarl's feast, but they'll fill your belly."
"Seen a lot of travelers lately. Mostly soldier, nowadays."
"You met the Lylvieves? Quiet family, but they're the heart of Dragon Bridge."
Poor Horgeir. Everyone in town knows about his wife's affair but him. Probably better if he doesn't know.
"I think the dragons are here to test us, and make sure we're still true Nords."
"I was a barmaid at the Winking Skeever when I met my husband, rest his soul. Wasn't for him, I'd still be working there!"
"Respect the law, and you'll have no trouble in Dragon Bridge."
Mind you don't cross Tassius. He's in charge around here.
Don't start any trouble and I think we'll get along just fine.
"At least, if you're gonna cause trouble, go somewhere else, okay? Please?"
Another quiet day.
Another quiet day... I hope.
Heard there were wolves on the road up north.
Those rebels better not try coming to Haafingar.
"Oh my, a guest!"
"Please, make yourself at home!"
Lone travelers can find these woods a little treacherous.
We've been looking for someone to join us in a hunt.
Hern and I do so adore guests! These guards are such a bore.
"A guest, oh my!"
Why don't you stay a while?
"The patrols never seem to give us time to be alone, the nosy pests."
Is Hert his sister or his wife? Or both?
Hert keeps giving me this look. I don't know if she wants me or if she wants to eat me.
"Just my luck, stuck in the sticks with this crazy old woman."
I grew up hearing songs about Eyldi the Bear! She wrestled a storm out of the sky!
"Now that our [QUOTE]ghost[QUOTE] has been unmasked, I hope we see more visitors in town than just the occasional pilgrim."
"If I were you, I'd keep away from the barrow on the east side of town... it's haunted."
"We don't get many visitors through here, unless their headed up to High Hrothgar of course."
Need a room? Maybe a drink? You name it.
Let me know if I can get you anything.
Anything I can help you with? A drink or a room perhaps?
"Pardon me, milord. Would you care to hear me play my lute?"
"Pardon me, milady. Would you care to hear me play my lute?"
"If you fancy a bit of music, let me know."
I can't believe Fastred's gone. I... I should have been nicer to her.
I can't believe Fastred ran off to Riften with that... that bastard.
"My daughter's driving me crazy, so forgive me if I'm a bit on edge."
"If you ever settle down to have children, think twice before you do it."
Any idea how I can get my daughter's head out of the clouds?
You a pilgrim or just passing through?
"Watch yourself on High Hrothgar, I hear wolves prowl the steps."
I hope Fastred's doing well in Riften. I miss her.
You must be another pilgrim on the way up to High Hrothgar. No other reason to pass through here.
"Pilgrim or not, if I were you, I'd move right through our backwards little town."
You better not be here to stir up any trouble.
And to think that we've been supplying the Greybeards with our own food supplies. What have they ever done for us?
Oh! You're a traveler! You must have so much to tell about the world outside this boring town!
Have anything interesting to tell me?
I can't imagine how exciting it must be like to journey from place to place. You're so lucky!
"Narfi's happy now. Maybe Narfi can sleep. Sleep all night. Sleep, sleep, sleep."
"Narfi's sad now. Still wait for Reyda. No more sleep. No, no... no."
"I can't see you, Reyda! I can't find you! Why are you hiding? Hiding, hide, hide, hide! Don't make me sad!"
"Oh Reyda! Redya! You live among the clouds now, dear Reyda!"
I miss Reyda. She was so nice to Narfi. Narfi's sad he can't be with Reyda.
You don't look like a pilgrim. Why bother visiting Ivarstead?
Hmm? What do you want?
Is it absolutely necessary for you to bother me right now?
Thanks again for delivering those supplies to the Greybeards.
"Ah, good to see you again! How did that delivery go?"
Passing through on your way to High Hrothgar? About to make a delivery up there myself.
"I wish I could make my deliveries more often, but the road's getting dangerous."
"7,000 Steps indeed... next time they need to build it closer to the ground..."
I'm going to put those pelts you gave me to good use.
"So, have you shown those furry menaces that I mean business?"
This has to be the worst place in Skyrim to run a mill. How am I supposed to do anything with all those bears running around?
These damn bears are driving me crazy!
Can you believe it? Another pile of logs ruined.
"I swear, if one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to burn my mill to the ground!"
"Hello, my friend? What can I do for you on such a fine day?"
"Miss Temba is much happier now that you took care of those bears. She may not look like she is, but I can tell."
Those bears are making Miss Temba so angry. I hope you can do something about them.
"Such a fine day, smell the air! Isn't it wonderful?"
"I hope life's treating you well, friend."
"The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!"
Gods. A woman attacked right on the streets.
Are you all right? Did you see what happened?
Balgruuf!
"Ready to listen to the Silver-Blood family now, Igmund?"
I think I'll like living here.
Ahhh... It's good to be home.
Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls. Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?
Thongvor. I should have executed your whole treacherous clan when I had the chance.
"So enters Maven Black-Briar, the glint of Imperial coin in her eyes. So tell me, what's the price for a woman's integrity these days?"
Welcome back. I've left a few surprises for you to discover.
Enough! Both of you!
There is a burning city out there that needs a government.
Are you two quite done?
"You, go pack your things."
"And you, go sit on that damn chair and start acting like a Jarl."
"If you ladies are finished bickering, there's much to be done."
"Jarl Black-Briar put your government together. Do it now, or there will be rioting in the streets."
We must move quickly to prevent further violence.
"If you two are finished with the touching homecoming, there's a city in chaos out there."
"He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order."
"Come Galmar, we have much to do."
"Jarl Black-Briar. I must admit, I do like the sound of that."
"And don't worry about any rioting, Legate. I have it under control."
We will soon begin publicly executing captured men. That should send a clear message to the people.
"Indeed. Come, there is much to be done."
This isn't over.
You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!
The Empire will return. Count on it.
"Yes, but not likely the one you intend."
Now that is a shame.
But what you fail to realize is that you involved yourself in this [QUOTE]insanity[QUOTE] when you took Grelod's life. You made your choice.
Now it's time to face the consequences of your actions. You don't leave this shack until someone dies.
"See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid. You understand that."
"Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send the poor fool to the Void.  I'll give you the key to this shack, and you'll be on your way."
Am I to take your silence as acceptance?
"Then you know where we stand. Make your kill, and we're square. Repayment of your debt is but a discreet knife thrust away."
"Our Family, my dearest. Our Family. Together, united as one, the Dark Brotherhood can accomplish anything."
"But you must be anxious to get to work. I'm arranging a job, but need a bit more time. For now, go see Nazir. He's got several smaller contracts."
"Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting."
"Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors."
"Soon, my dearest. Soon."
"I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over."
"Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting."
"Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors."
"Hmm... Yes, the silence suits you. Gives you an air of mystery."
"Now, down to business. I'm arranging a job for you. But in the meantime, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over."
"Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting."
"Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors."
You want to talk to me? After everything you've done?
"Divines smile on you, friend."
"I hope the wilds claim you, one of these days."
"What do you need, my friend?"
I've had just about all I'm willing to take from you. What is it?
"You and me, we're the only people around who aren't complete fools."
Now why would I want to talk to you?
Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me.
"Something you need, you miserable wretch?"
Good to see you. Finally someone useful is around.
I don't like talking to someone who holds their honor so cheaply.
"Good to have you by my side, friend. I need reliable people around."
"You have something to say, dog? Something on your mind?"
You're someone who can get things done. I like that.
I should bash your face in after all you've done.
You've been a good friend to me. That means something.
What do you want? You've caused enough trouble.
"Good to see you again, friend."
You. What do you want?
Now here's a man I'm glad to see.
Now here's a woman I'm glad to see.
You! You're going to hurt me again aren't you? Just stay away.
It's so good to see you again.
I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone.
Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass.
Gods strike you down.
My favorite drinking buddy. Let's get some mead.
Just looking at you makes me upset.
Good to see Skyrim still has such fine people. You give an old man hope.
You're just rotten. No good.
I hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.
Leave me alone. Can't an old man have some peace?
You're not as dumb as you look.
Here to shame an old woman? Leave me be.
"Well, look at you. If only everyone acted like you did."
You. Every time I look at you my blood boils.
It's a fine day with you around.
You're nothing but trouble.
"Good day, friend! Keeping well?"
Worthless. Everyone like you is completely worthless.
Good to see you. At least you know how to treat someone properly.
"Every time I think of you, I imagine a Saber Cat closing its claws around your face."
It's so good to see you again.
You're mean. I hate you. I hate you forever and ever and ever.
You're the best! Can you be my father?
You're the best! Can you be my mother?
I hope monsters come and eat you.
I bet you could slay one of those mean old dragons. I bet you could do anything.
The gods know what you've done.
"A fine day to you, friend. May you die with a sword in your hands."
"What do you want, milk drinker?"
"May the gods watch over your battles, friend."
Absolutely no time to deal with lowlifes these days. Go away.
"Oh, it's you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant."
So nice to have pleasant company for a change.
There are so few pleasures in life as fine as your company.
There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.
"We're one of the same kind, you and I. I'm glad to have met you."
"Azura's wisdom to you, friend."
Filth. Run to the horizon before I hunt you down.
What do you want? Aren't your hands coated with enough blood?
"May your next fight bring you victory, friend."
"For your crimes, may Malacath boil your blood and grind your bones."
May your weapons be sharp and your prey fresh.
Khajiit wishes for you to go away. You have done us too much harm.
"These sands are cold, but Khajiit feels warmness from your presence."
"Its scent is foul, unclean. Hurtful."
Speak. Khajiit will listen until all the sugars in the world turn sour.
It fills us with rage. What harm does it bring to us now?
"Ours is to smile at your passing, friend."
It annoys us. What does it want to take from us now?
It is our most favored company.
Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round!
I have something amazing to show you that demands your attention!
Gather 'round all!
"No pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!"
This way everyone! Over here!
You need to hear this!
"Come on, Brynjolf... what is it this time?"
"Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to get left out."
That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be crushed nirnroot mixed with water!
"That was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real thing."
"Lads and lasses I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!"
"Oh come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?"
The one and only.
Mystical beings who live in legends and were masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their veins!
"How did you get that, then? No one's seen them in years!"
My sources must remain a secret for their own protection but I can promise that the contents are genuine.
"One sip of the elixir and your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or perhaps limitless power could be yours!"
How much does it cost?
Only twenty gold septims! Hurry before my supply is gone.
Grow back that missing limb!
See into other people's thoughts!
Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments!
Wield powerful magic incantations!
Live for thousands of years!
Who knows what powers the elixir will unlock!
"Please hurry, I have only a few bottles left!"
Only twenty septims a bottle!
He has to be lying!
Twenty coins? No one has that much.
"Don't listen to him, he's making this up."
Why would you even listen to him?
He gives other merchants a bad name.
This is ridiculous.
"I dunno, sounds like I should try it."
What if he's right? Maybe I'll buy one.
I could get rich and stop selling these trinkets.
This is just what I need right now.
"I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?"
"That Wisp Essence didn't help, but maybe this will."
"Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to buy."
What a waste of time.
Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.
Good. Wait until I start the distraction and then show me what you're made of.
We've been contracted to make sure Brand-Shei remembers not to meddle in affairs that aren't his own.
"Now, since we're not the Dark Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him, we're just going to make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days."
Do you want me to hold your hand as well?
You have the ring. All you have to do is pick Brand-Shei's pocket and plant it there.
Do you want me to hold your hand as well?
You're going to have to sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the strongbox.
"Then when you have the ring, you pickpocket Brand-Shei and leave it behind."
"You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds."
You've been quiet so far. What do you think we should do?
"Well, your classmates certainly seem to disagree with you."
Is that so?
Not going to weigh in either way?
"I admire your restraint, but there are times when you must make decisions, even without all the facts. Rely on instinct."
See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
See? She agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
"Oh, don't listen to him. We can do it, just give us a chance!"
"Oh, don't listen to her. We can do it, just give us a chance!"
"We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?"
"Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years."
It's a shame you wished for something so dull as me taking back the mutt. Quite the lack of imagination on your part.
"Now, as for your wish... An end to the war, was it?"
"Now, as for your wish... Power, was it?"
"A lack of ambition like that really ought to be punished. Perhaps by turning you into a worm, or maybe a few decades of..."
"I'll make sure this war ends, all right. Just as soon as the dragons swarm across Skyrim and wipe out all of you puny..."
You can be a part of a tremendous power - all you have to do is let your soul be absorbed by this axe. I never said it would be your power...
"Vile! None of that - you made a deal, and the mortal stood by it honestly. Now it's your turn to come through."
"Oh, fine. Have my boon and be done with it. I've got more interesting deals to make, anyway."
"Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen."
"So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous."
"Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you."
"Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!"
"Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned."
"What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study."
Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!
"Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable."
But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?
"I wasn't sure that he'd see the light, but I'm sure you [QUOTE]explained[QUOTE] it to him. Well done!"
He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find.
The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.
"She's as stubborn as she is beautiful, isn't she? Glad you found a way to get her to pay."
Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine that she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.
"Hmph. Yes. Yes, I believe you are. Very well, then."
"You need to find and kill Safia, the captain of the pirate ship Red Wave."
"The ship travels the northern coast, and sometimes isn't even in Skyrim at all. So you'll have to be patient. Good luck."
Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.
They will sing stories of this day.
"Well, well... color me impressed, lad. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!"
"Well, well... color me impressed, lass. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!"
Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!
"So... now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?"
I trust everything went well?
Have anything for us yet?
"What is it with you and all these questions? Very well, ask away."
"All right, I'll entertain you a bit more. Go on."
Now what did you want? I already paid you.
I know you... everyone's been talking about it. What are you here for?
I'm not paying you or Brynjolf a single coin! Now get out of my tavern!
I said get out! I'm not paying a single coin!
Here for a room or something to drink? Show me some coin first.
You want something or not?
We got the message... now just take your business elsewhere.
What do you want?
"I hope you're here for friendlier reasons now... after all, I'm all paid up."
"Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?"
No! That urn was priceless!
"Please, reconsider what you're doing. Maybe I can pay later..."
I... I don't care! I'm not paying!
"I'm sorry, you're going to have to leave. Tell Brynjolf he'll just have to make due without my coin."
"So, can I interest you in anything today?"
"Look, I got the message. What else did you want?"
"It's you! Please, don't hurt me!"
Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have left!
"Ask all you want, you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Not in this part of the world anyway."
"If you're looking for a room, try the Bee and Barb. This place is for the working man."
What did you want?
I'll be here when you're done.
Come back when you grow a backbone.
Just leave me in peace.
I hope Brynjolf chokes on his gold.
I can't stand this city. It's impossible to make a decent living here.
"She was the toughest of the bunch. Honestly, I'm amazed she didn't kick you out of the Bee and Barb herself."
"Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for family."
Talk to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something out of him. They're... well acquainted if you catch my meaning.
And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to regret this day.
"Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all."
"This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable."
Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared.
Here's your payment.
Good. And I hope you were careful in that lumber mill. Those splinters and rusty nails can be quite nasty.
"Your payment, for a job well done."
Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder.
I could do this all day. Here's your payment.
"No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale. Well done."
"And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette."
"Unless, of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment."
"Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth."
"Your payment, as per the usual."
"Personally, I've always found Argonians to be incredibly unpredictable opponents. Especially near water."
"In any event, nice work. Here's your payment."
Ah! Well done! Well done!
"Those caravaners can be an elusive bunch. Takes a fair bit of stalking to take one down. But then, that's half the fun, isn't it?"
"Here's your payment. Well earned, indeed."
"Ah, so the hunter came to know the fear of the hunted, hmm?"
"Your payment, my friend. Well done."
"Don't worry, my friend, I'll spare you the facetious quip about killing a defenseless old woman."
Infiltrating an occupied fort and making it out in one piece is nothing to joke about. Well done.
Your payment for services rendered.
"I hope the elf didn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that."
But I digress. Here's your payment.
"Hmph. Well, that's sure to throw a branch into Falkreath's well-oiled political machine."
"Here's your payment. Well earned, as always."
"By Sithis, now I am truly impressed!"
"To kill a pirate captain, on her own ship no less? Simply masterful!"
"You've not only earned your payment, but my respect as well. And believe me, friend - that does not come easily."
I'm afraid that concludes our business. You have exhausted all available additional contracts.
"But I'm sure you've got plenty to keep you busy right about now, hmm?"
"As a matter of fact, I do. Two of them. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge."
Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.
Happy hunting.
"I'm sorry, I don't. Come see me again later."
"Well then, your timing couldn't be better."
"As it turns out, I've got two new contracts. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge."
Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.
Happy hunting.
"More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last set of contracts I gave you. Why don't you concentrate on eliminating that final target."
"More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last two contracts I gave you. Let's get those done, hmm?"
"Well aren't we the eager one? Sorry to disappoint, but there's nothing. Try me again later."
"There are indeed. Three, to be exact."
"There's Deekus, a shipwreck scavenger. Ma'randru-jo, a traveling caravaner. And Anoriath, a hunter."
"Hmph. How about, instead of giving you another contract, I simply deride you for not finishing the one you still have?"
"So it would appear. Though I'd suspect she'd want you to complete your other contracts first. Do those, then we'll talk about something new."
"Just one right now, actually."
"I need you to eliminate an old woman named Agnis, a servant in Fort Greymoor."
"Well, yes. Two of them. But you're reaching the end of what I have available."
"Your targets are a dark elf wizard named Maluril, in the dwarven ruin of Mzinchaleft. And Helvard, the housecarl of Falkreath."
"Kill these two, and I'll have one last contract to give you. I'm just finalizing some details now."
Not so fast Elf!
I presume you're talking to me?
On your knees!
"Unfortunately, we've had to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems with the local Nords."
"We don't anticipate any real violence, but it never hurts to be prepared."
Our newest members are housed here in the Hall of Attainment.
"I'll ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may be working on research or... delicate experiments."
"Now I'll show you to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly."
This is where you'll be staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate of others.
"Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions."
"Initially you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed Wizards."
"Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices. Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior members know."
"I said, on your knees, Elf!"
Enjoy this while you can. Soon you will all be slaves.
Raagh!
Someone get that thing out of here and burn it.
Well would you look at that!
This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.
I'm not sure. I certainly wasn't expecting this.
This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.
Looks like we're the only ones who made it. Was that really a dragon? The bringers of the End Times?
We should keep moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
Follow me.
Close the door.
"Come on, close the door."
"You're not afraid of me, are you?"
"Just close the door, will you?"
Now we can talk.
Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?
Good. And you'll have a chance to prove it to me soon enough.
This is no time to play the reluctant hero. You either are or aren't Dragonborn.
But I'll see for myself soon enough.
You're wrong. It is my business. You may be the only one that can stop these dragons.
But you'll understand that soon enough.
Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
"It seems to be spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften. The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds."
That's her business. Not mine. Probably not yours either.
Another new student... I'm surprised at how many of you there are lately.
"Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current clothes."
"I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your first class. Are you ready to begin?"
"Yes, just a brief overview of our facilities. Are you ready?"
"Wonderful. Please follow me, and don't wander off."
I see.
"Well, please let me know when you are."
The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands of years.
"The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements. It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and general meetings."
"It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be honest. Don't pay much, either."
But they'll keep you busy. Just do them as you're able. There's no real time limit - the targets aren't going anywhere.
"You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever works for you."
"Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now."
"Your targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and Beitild, a mine boss."
"When you've completed all those, we'll see if I might have some more."
Who I am really isn't as important as what I am. And what I am is an admirer. Of sorts.
Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage? Things like that tend to get around.
"Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you saved a group of urchins, to boot."
"Ah, but there is a slight... problem."
"You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates."
"Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill... that you stole."
A kill you must repay.
We need to talk.
"Look. Something is happening here. I'm not sure entirely what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out."
"If the Night Mother really did give you an order to talk to a contact, we'd be mad to ignore it."
"And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary."
"So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads. Hmm?"
Best put your other tasks aside. The real challenge is about to begin.
"With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor."
"And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life."
"Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will."
Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.
"With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor."
"And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life."
"Unfortunately, in your zeal, you failed to eliminate Vici while she addressed her guests, as directed. I'm sorry, but your bonus is forfeit."
Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.
"Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin."
"Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden nearly as much as he should lately."
"And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?"
You are not worthy.
"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Write of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
"Oh yes, it is Cicero! You were a fool to spare me. What, did you think I would be grateful? Cicero should be Listener! Not you! Now you will die!"
...
"Ahhh.... gotcha! Oh, Listener, you should see the look on your face! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Oh, Cicero has returned! Not to kill the kind Listener, but to serve, until one of us dies horribly, in service to our Mother! Best friends forever!"
"In the meantime, I'll make myself at home in the Sanctuary. I'm sure Mother needs... tending."
"You! You're responsible for the siege of Solitude! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!"
"You! You're responsible for the siege of that... city! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!"
Well now. Funny you should ask.
"If you turn around, you'll notice my guests. I've [QUOTE]collected[QUOTE] them from... well, that's not really important. The here and now. That's what matters."
"You see, there's a contract out on one of them, and that person can't leave this room alive. But... which one? Go on, see if you can figure it out."
Make your choice. Make your kill. I just want to observe... and admire.
"There you go. Take a look around, there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I can find something for these burns."
Let me see if I can get that door open.
Let's keep moving. That thing is still out there.
"Come on, this way."
You. Over here!
"Ah, there you are. Good, I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway. We've got some business to discuss."
I do indeed.
"You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in The Hag's Cure, when the shop is open."
"The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament."
"Her name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out."
"Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done."
"Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are."
You go speak with Muiri. I've got to deal with the Night Mother and her little... clown.
It's all up to you now... Listener.
Go. Quickly. Hide in the coffin before Cicero and the traitor meet.
It's time we put a little kink in the Emperor's security.
Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation to visit Skyrim.
"Goodbye, assassin."
"You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it."
"Go on, now."
Good luck. And try not to get yourself killed.
Happy hunting.
Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all very eager to meet you.
Humble Cicero lives to serve.
Damnable jester...
"I took that prancing fool into my home, and this is how he repays me?"
You may go now...
"I am yours, master."
"I am yours, mistress."
"Walk always in shadow, my Listener."
"Just say the word, master."
"Just say the word, mistress."
"Ready when you need me, Listener."
What a waste. Fools.
*Sigh* I was part of the gang in the ruins here. Friend of mine went crazy and stole the boss' sword. They blamed me for it.
"Look, I'm done here. Mop the floor with these idiots for all I care. Just get out of my way."
Hmph. Suit yourself.
"It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our bleeding homeland. What do they want?"
"I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague."
But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King.
I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there.
"Good. Maybe he's realized he's beaten. The way things are going, we'll be knocking at the gates of Solitude itself before too long."
Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could throw at us.
I doubt the Empire has the stomach for much more bloodletting.
"Good. They've had their victories, but Tullius is no fool. The Empire can't afford to keep this up much longer."
I can't agree to any peace council until I know Tullius will be there. The other Jarls could take that as a sign of weakness.
"He is weak. And no doubt knows it. He's no fool, he'll come, if only to give his troops a chance to refit."
But you're right. Victory is within our grasp. We can afford to give the Empire one more chance to withdraw.
You're right. Let Tullius be the one to insult the Greybeards by refusing their summons.
Show up these Imperials for the foreigners they really are.
Hmm. We could use the time to bring in new recruits. Our losses have been heavy recently...
Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail between his legs.
The enemy is mustering for a final attack.
Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.

"Yes, my friend. Though no one has been able to get close to her for as long as I can remember."
"As you can see, Eldergleam's roots are large and stretch far, blocking any path to her trunk."
"Though, believe it or not, there are rumors of a weapon that even Eldergleam herself would lift her roots for, more out of fear than respect."
"Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have nothing more to discuss. I encourage you to take your time and enjoy yourself. You look like you could use the rest."
"Mama, can we talk. You know, about papa?"
"Of course, sweetie. What'd you like to know?"
I don't know. What'd he look like?
"He had your soft face, and that silly grin you get when you've done something wrong. That's his, too."
"You are in Eldergleam Sanctuary - just a small glimpse of what beauty Kynareth has to offer. Wonderful place, isn't it?"
"Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend.  Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?"
"Welcome to Eldergleam Sanctuary, my friend. If you have any questions, speak to Asta."
"Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such... Wait, it can't be."
"The rumors were true! You carry the one weapon Eldergleam fears - Nettlebane. I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it."
"The rumors were true... I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it."
(Growling)
"Not now. The Underforge, tonight."
Not here. The Underforge. Come on.
"Thank you for coming, brother."
"Thank you for coming, sister."
"Ah, there you are."
"The blood calls, brother."
"The blood calls, sister."
"Speak to me, Shield-Brother."
"Speak to me, Shield-Sister."
Let's make the bastards pay.
Skjor's somewhere ahead. We need to find him.
"Less talk, more hunt."
"The blood calls, brother."
"The blood calls, sister."
Let's keep moving.
You've returned.
There you are.
You don't know what you're dealing with. There will be consequences if you harm that tree. Leave this place - you're not welcome here anymore.
"Yes, you were going to demonstrate your ability, were you not?"
A standard spell for one skilled in Destruction magic is the Firebolt. Casting one at the seal on the ground here would be sufficient.
Those invested in Restoration magic find Healing Hands to be essential. Can you cast it on me? That would prove your skill.
"The Fear spell has saved the life of many an Illusion mage. If you could cast it on the seal here on the ground, that would prove your skill."
The Flame Atronach is a vital companion for anyone relying on Conjuration. Summoning one here would certainly show your skill.
"The Mage Light spell is useful to any mage, not just those specializing in Alteration. Can you cast one on the seal on the ground?"
"It would seem that you have yet to reach a level of skill that the College would find valuable, so I'm afraid I can't allow you to join at this time."
"Unfortunately, one needs to be able to cast at least Apprentice level spells in any school of magic before being allowed to join the College."
"And thus, you're not skilled enough to be a candidate. I'm afraid we're not interested."
Nords don't care much for magic. The College in Winterhold is about the only place it's not looked down on.
Otherwise you could talk to the Jarl's pet wizard in Solitude.
The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic.
Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.
"Magic? Goodness, not here! Nothing dangerous like that! That's all kept to that College up in Winterhold."
Better that than dealing with Ulfric's wizard like some do.
"Magic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place."
"Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord."
"Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should."
You'd never think to learn from a Nord like the Jarl's wizard.
"There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic. It's very secretive, though, and you know how people hate secrets."
The Jarl's court wizard was taught there. That one's full of secrets.
"Magic? That's dangerous. You want to learn that, go to that College in Winterhold. They teach that stuff there."
Hey! I know. The Jarl's wizard could teach ya. He's lots closer.
"I've got no interest in magic users. No use for their kind at all. They're way up north in Winterhold, and that's fine with me."
I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.
"Bit of advice, folks here don't care for magic or those that use it. If you're intent on it, check at the College up in Winterhold."
Either that or go see the Jarl's court wizard.
"Looking to blow yourself up? I hear that's what magic does to you. There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic, unless that blew up too."
Be a lot safer just to have the Jarl's wizard teach you a thing or two.
"Magic is nothing but trouble. If you're set on it, there's that College in Winterhold or Ulfric's court wizard. But don't say I didn't warn you."
"The people of Skyrim don't like magic much, so about the only place you're likely to find a teacher is the College of Winterhold."
"That'd be the College in Winterhold. I suppose you'll be headed there, then. Well, don't let me get in your way."
Seen enough magic in my day to know to stay away from it. I'd stay away from the Jarl's wizard in Dawnstar too.
"If you wanna be a damn fool, go to the College in Winterhold instead."
You lookin' for Falion? Why don't you go bother those mages at their College in Winterhold and leave my brother alone?
"Any aspiring mage would do well to look for the College in Winterhold. Head there, and you'll get what you're after."
Although our Jarl's humble wizard might be willing to help you too.
Magic? Got no good use for that here. Mages keep to their College in Winterhold. Go bother them.
Wish the Jarl's wizard would up and leave with ya.
"Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them."
Else you could go see the Jarl's wizard. Might be able to help you.
Magic? You're on the wrong side of Skyrim. You want Winterhold... that College there. They teach it.
"Otherwise you can try the Jarl's wizard. I wouldn't, though."
Winterhold. You want the College there. They teach quite a bit.
"Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn."
"Not here. Definitely not here. You want to learn, join the College in Winterhold. They'll deal with it."
"Magic is... frowned upon in Skyrim. Only the mages at the College of Winterhold teach it freely. If you wish to learn, join them."
"A prospective student, are you? Well, I'm afraid I'm not much good at teaching. You should try your luck at the College of Winterhold."
I have no time or patience for a student. Perhaps the College of Winterhold will grant you admission.
"That's right. College of Winterhold, just north of town. Hard to miss."
"No? Very well, it's your choice."
"Well done, indeed."
"Well, you clearly possess the minimum aptitude required. Congratulations. I'll escort you up to the gate."
You'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine right away. And welcome to the College of Winterhold.
"Good to see you again, friend! We've opened the mine back up. If you're here for work, I'll buy any ore you have."
I never thought I'd see Kolskeggr again.
The mine is just how I remember it.
It's good to be mining again.
I've never seen Pavo so happy. It's good to be back in Kolskeggr.
I feel like we're mining even more ore than before.
"It's the rush of good fortune, my friend. It makes you work harder."
Are you worried the Forsworn might return?
I doubt the Forsworn would risk holding this mine a second time. They lost many of their warriors.
Do you remember the Legion? Fighting the Thalmor in the Great War?
"Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war."
"We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem."
"There were many good battles, friend. I miss those days."
You miss them? I don't know how many times I feared for my life.
Well I can't just tell that to any skeever that washes up.
"From the look of you, I'm guessing you're more looking to cause some trouble for the Horkers."
"Haldyn will take my hide for this, but Skyrim's been feeling a bit confining lately."
"We draw council at Japhet's Folly. The fools in Windhelm won't go near it, which is fine by us."
"If you'll pardon me now, my crew needs gathering. Should be in Hammerfell before the other Horkers know who let slip their secret."
Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me!
"Here, just like I promised. This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again."
"There you are. Look, I... I just wanted to say thanks for coming to find me. Back in Dawnstar. Crazy jester finally met his match, am I right?"
The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?
That twisted jester will pay for what's he's done...
I'm afraid I don't have a primary contract for you yet.
"Why am I not surprised to learn Cicero is alive? I still can't stomach the little clown, but if you've welcomed him here, I won't question it."
"Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? You may have killed the Gourmet, but true artistry never dies."
"Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? But not the way you make it! Ha ha ha. No, certainly not..."
I've been expecting you.
Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.
"So, what of the old beggar, Narfi? Is it done? Has he groveled for his last septim?"
How went your meeting with Ennodius Papius? Did you prove his paranoia legitimate?
"I see you're back from Dawnstar. Beitild lies dead, I hope?"
"You're alive. Then I guess you haven't paid a visit to the vampire yet, hmm?"
Please tell me you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from his skin...
"Taken care of that layabout Deekus, yet? Or does the idea of killing a fellow Argonian make your scales crawl?"
No new boots? Does this mean the Argonian is still alive?
You smell like dead cat. Can I assume Ma'randru-jo has been taken care of?
"How went your encounter with  Ma'randru-jo? Back in Hammerfell, I always loved watching two cats rip each other to shreds..."
"Hmph. No arrows protruding from your skull... Can I assume Anoriath is dead, then?"
"Ah, back from Fort Graymoor. The old servant has been put out of her misery, I hope?"
"So, you've returned from Mzinchaleft! A Dwarven ruin... what an exotic place for a kill. Assuming Maluril is actually... dead?"
"Back from your little vacation in Falkreath. So, did you enjoy the sights, sample the food... kill the housecarl?"
"You haven't faced that pirate captain yet, have you? Safia? I only ask because you're still alive..."
"So many contracts, so little time..."
Will there ever come a time when the people of Skyrim no longer need our services? I think not.
"Still here? What's the matter, can't handle what I'm throwing your way?"
I wish I had more contracts to dole out. You handled those jobs like a born killer.
"You reek of death, my friend. I salute you."
"Remember the passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE]"
"The Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Close to the road, but away from prying eyes."
Have you talked to Nazir? He's sure to have some additional contracts for you.
"I don't have anything for you just yet. Please, talk to Nazir, and see what he has available."
"I'm still trying to find a suitable contract for you. Continue to work with Nazir on the, um, supplemental assignments."
"The Keeper will be arriving soon, with the body of the Night Mother. So many preparations to be made..."
"Go, take care of the Muiri contract. There will be plenty more, I promise you."
"Why are you still standing there? Hurry, before the meeting begins."
Speak with Nazir and see if he has any contracts available. I need time to read Motierre's letter.
What are you waiting for? My husband is out there somewhere with that lunatic. Find them! Do what you've been tasked to do!
Shouldn't you be out ruining someone's special day?
"Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed."
"Ah, good to see you, sister. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed."
"Cicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!"
Let's kill someone.
Citizen?
You must be lost. The tavern is down the road a piece.
"I'm fairly certain you wandered into the wrong building, friend..."
"Yes, Listener?"
I am yours to command.
"How may I serve you, my Listener?"
"Yes, Listener? How may I serve you?"
Listener. It is an honor to stand before you.
"How may I serve you, my Listener?"
Please...
What is it you want?
Just... just stop. And I'll tell you where I've hidden my treasure.
It's... in a hollowed-out rock. In the tundra. A bit west of Whiterun. Now please... please stop.
"Oh gods, you've taken everything I have. Just kill me and be done with it..."
Why are you people doing this?
Is it information you want?
"This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it."
"It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?"
Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.
You... you can't do this to me...
"Do you have any idea who I am? When my father hears about this, he will gut you."
"Ah, now I understand. This is about that my father's hidden cache, isn't it? The dowry for my wedding."
"Ha! Well it's safely hidden away, in a hollowed-out tree stump. Just outside Riften, tucked away nice and secure. You'll never find it."
"Damn it. I gave it away, didn't I?"
I'll tell you anything. Anything! Just please stop... hurting me...
I just...  can't take the pain. Not a second longer.
I'll give you money. Treasure. I have some things hidden away. Take them all. They're yours. Just please... stop.
Just north of Windhelm. There's a hollowed-out rock. I have some things hidden in there. Take them! They're yours.
I've told you everything I can. I don't know what else you could want...
"So... wait. Cicero is alive? And we're all friends again? I swear, I can hardly keep up..."
"You know, I can still sell you some potions and such, or train you in alchemy."
I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
I can't wait to see what the future brings.
Do you need alchemy components? Or training?
"Hello, Listener."
"What do you think? Some more Nirnroot, maybe?"
"I learned to cook from my father. Ah, but that was a long time ago. Before, you know... I killed him. But let's not talk about that now."
I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?
This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.
"What do you need, Listener?"
"Listener, please... if Cicero is going to be a part of this Sanctuary I'll accept that. But can't you do something about the... dancing?"
"Got to admit, I find the Night Mother's presence... comforting."
"The new initiates are working out well. Eager, dedicated, and not afraid to get their hands wet."
"Things proceeding well, Listener?"
"Yes, Listener?"
"The Dark Brotherhood is on the rise again, Listener. I can feel it."
Cicero can talk for a moment. Just a moment. Then Mother must be... tended to.
"Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment..."
"Yes, Listener? How can Cicero be of service?"
You didn't die. A battle you live through is a great honor.
Did you ever want to return to your stronghold? Go back to your family?
"What? Oh gods, I don't want to die..."
Excuse me? What kind of question is that?
Me? Ha! Are you serious?
"My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You know, a... a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life."
"That's all! I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?"
"None of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just do it already!"
"As Mara is my witness, if I didn't have this hood on right now I would spit right in your face..."
"Ahhh... Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters."
"Have you not heard of me? Perhaps I will have my people carve my name in your corpse, as a reminder."
"What did I do? Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry."
I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a home to keep and children to feed. Now let me out of here!
"Tell you what. You release me, and I promise my associates won't hunt you down like an animal and butcher you in the street. It's a win-win."
I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the world and spread merriment.
And you did just that! I haven't been so entertained in at least a hundred years.
Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not deal in mere [QUOTE]pranks.[QUOTE]
"This may have begun as a minor amusement, but it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff."
"Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through.  But you... you're going places."
Maybe a little influence from your old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...
My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you locked up in here with the staff.
Wake up!
"That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!"
"Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this."
"Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid."
"It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it!"
"I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body, and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!"
"Of course you are! I prayed, and you came, and now you'll accept my contract!"
"It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract."
"You don't have to say anything. There's no need. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract."
"My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall."
"The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us."
"So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind!"
Finally! My prayers have been answered!
You've come at last! I knew you would!
Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.
"It's Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften."
Please don't kill Constance Michel. She really is kind.
Well? Is it done?
Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
What do you want? You have no business being in here!
Riff-raff! That's all you Riften people are!
"This is an orphanage, not an inn. Begone from here."
You don't scare me.
"You're trying to frighten me, hmm? Do your worst!"
I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.
The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!
"Aretino? Why that little bastard! You tell him I'm coming for him! And when I find him, it will be the beating of his miserable life!"
"What are you staring at, you worthless piece of gutter trash? I simply must start locking the doors again..."
Is someone there?
What was that?
Huh?
Where are you?
You can't hide from me!
Over here!
Be careful!
"Hey, watch it!"
Don't do that.
What are you doing that for?
You could have just asked.
"I saw you do that, you know."
Ha! Found you!
What do you think you're doing?
You're not supposed to be in here.
Oh no! By the gods! This can't be happening!
You dirty thief!
"Stop, thief!"
I understand.
Of course.
How much?
It can't be helped.
Not my problem.
It would seem so.
It's all in this note.
You've done well.
Maybe you can help me.
"Thank you. Here, this is for you."
Just bring it back to me.
I can pay you.
Okay. Just this once.
How can I argue with that?
"Okay, okay. You've talked me into it."
No need to get rough!
Whatever you say!
Don't hurt me! You win.
A little coin always greases the wheels.
"Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?"
For that price? Sure.
You expect me to believe that?
Nah. I don't think so.
That doesn't change anything.
I'll teach you to talk to me that way!
Hope you're willing to back those words up with your fists!
I don't have to take that from you!
What? Nooo!
We've got an assassin! Check the shadows!
Gods help us!
What in the...?
"I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even for a drunk like you."
"I would need to challenge the chief, and take his head, to return home. I'd rather stay here."
"Don't tell me you, of all people, are afraid of a battle."
"If you had to kill your own brother to be allowed back home, you'd think twice as well."
You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?
"Sorry's not good enough! Not while my Gleda is still out there, alone and afraid. You kidnapped her and sold her to that Giant."
Is that so? Does the name Gleda ring a bell? The star beauty of my farm? Kidnapped by a drunk lout and sold to a Giant?
"You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have you hauled away."
You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat like Gleda!
And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you get her back from that Giant.
You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick?
Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back - you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.
Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day!
"I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it."
"Only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,[QUOTE] and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there."
"So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me."
"It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love."
"But if there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the ring back. That was one of my best pieces."
"Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring?"
That's really a shame - I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said you'd have all the most interesting guests.
How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard.
"You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook."
Excellent! Sorry it didn't work out with you and your lady. I know how excited you were for the wedding.
You kept saying it would be a huge ceremony at Morvunskar. You said you even had some magic staff there that would handle all the guests.
I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work.
But this is supposed to be your work.
Head to the Riften jail and talk to Sibbi. Get him to tell you where Frost and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside Riften.
You'll be well paid for your time.
"Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering contracts we haven't had the chance to complete just yet."
"And more, dribbling in from time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be completed at your leisure."
"You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum."
"I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see."
None can stand against the Wolf Queen!
Well? What is the meaning of this?
"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand."
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he is. Now what is it that you want?
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here she is. Now what is it that you want?
There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I shall simply take my leave.
What? What trickery is this? You're not going anywhere until I find out what you're up to!
I am not [QUOTE]up to[QUOTE] anything. I apologize if I have offended in any way.
I'm not sure what just happened but I assure you I will get to the bottom of it.
Whatever it is those Psijics are up to. They cannot be trusted.
"For all we know, he's here to scout out the College. I'm sure they want to undermine our efforts."
"This! This... Orb. The Eye of Magnus, whatever you want to call it. It's clearly powerful, and no doubt they want it for themselves!"
I expect to be informed if they make any future attempts to contact you.
"Great Malacath, we beseech you, aid us in our time of need..."
"Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on."
"I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it."
"How did you get it? No, never mind, I probably shouldn't know."
I see... it looks like Suvaris has been traveling to Dawnstar to meet with a pirate crew there.
Get to Dawnstar and see what you can find out about these rogues. I'd wager they won't be too far from the tavern.
"Try to find out where their fortress is. The captain, Stig Salt-Plank, has to know something."
Heard of them? I've been captaining a crew for 'em well on nine years now. What's it to you?
"Know about them? Lad, you're looking at them."
"Know about them? Lass, you're looking at them."
"Just in time. This is Adelaisa, one of my superiors from the Company."
She's been dispatched to... eh... see to it that we get back on schedule.
You should probably speak to her.
I can't express how much easier you've made my job.
"Maybe Adelaisa will finally ease up, but I expect she won't."
"Ah, yes, your pay. The Company thanks you for your services. Should we ever be able to help you, stop by."
"Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started."
"Pirates, you see."
"Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell. Only the Shatter-Shields appear safe."
No. Not like this.
"What do you need, guardian?"
"Yes, champion of Azura?"
"The Twilight watches us all, guardian."
Just glad all that business with Malyn is over with. What did you need?
I don't like doing business with Azura's faithful. Make it quick.
"Look at me when I'm talking to you, eh?"
You start flapping that jaw of yours or I'll start flapping it for you. You understand me?
Where'd you stash it?
Am I going have to beat it out of you? Is that what you want?
"I. I don't know, it wasn't me. I swear!"
"Honest, I didn't take it!"
"(Sigh) Let's just kill them both, eh?"
(Whimpering)
(Sobbing)
"Go on, then. Deliver my message to Sibbi."
"I may not be fond of Letrush, but even I've got to admit he's got the upper hand."
"Ah, well, I recently approached Sibbi Black-Briar about buying Frost, one of the finest breeding horses in Skyrim. He agreed to sell."
"I paid Sibbi half the cost of Frost up front, but before he could deliver, Maven had him locked up. Sibbi believes this exempts him from our deal."
It does not.
"I want you to talk to Sibbi for me. Then, I want you to bring me Frost and the Lineage Papers that prove the horse's worth."
Good man. You won't regret it.
"Ah, you're a smart woman. That's exactly what I wanted to hear."
That's a real shame. You would've fit the bill nicely.
"Don't tell me - Sibbi and Louis Letrush? Well, Sibbi is in jail and Letrush is certainly welcome to try. My hired help is more than a match for him."
I'm aware of who stole Frost. And why.
I had no idea you were a man of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?
I had no idea you were a woman of violence. What exactly are you intending to do here?
You would violate this marvel of Kynareth's glory to fix that half-breed stump in Whiterun?
That's abominable. Barbaric. I'll have no part of this. Why didn't you tell me what you intended?
"With pleasure. Nature has a way of finding vengeance, though. You walk a bleak path, friend. One that will lead to suffering."
Well... yes. There is something.
"It won't repair the tree back at the temple, but we could bring them a new one."
"Very well. I can't stop you. But I can't bear to watch it, either."
Follow me. I think I can convince the tree to help us.
I am a traveler. A pilgrim. I follow the voice of Kynareth wherever it can be heard.
I've dreamed of seeing Eldergleam for years. Might I travel alongside you? I promise not to get in the way.
I thank you for your kindness.
I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.
"You've been here for a while, right? What was it like back when we could still make runs out to the coast?"
"Well, before that cave-in sealed our ships in here we could loot any size ship we wanted."
Where did you keep all that loot?  I've been here almost a year and haven't seen any of it.
The Captain has it locked away in that drowned ship by his quarters. He says it's [QUOTE]to keep it safe[QUOTE] but I know he's just keeping it for himself.
If only we could get our hands on that treasure. We could get out of here and never look back.
Maybe. For now just lay low and do your job. I have a feeling we'll be rid of the Captain soon...
"Yeah, rub it in. Just imagine what I could get done with my full power and none of these pesky [QUOTE]morals.[QUOTE]"
"Still, I've got this axe, and even if I can't use it, I'm sure someone would make a deal for it. Maybe I'll have a word with Molag Bal..."
I knew I could trust you!
"Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's happy. Just get over here, mutt."
"Don't worry. I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you trust me."
Well... I guess you could say I got on his nerves. I tend to be the voice of reason and he finds that... irksome.
"He couldn't just kill me, you see. We're technically part of each other. But he was able to banish me from his domain."
"Of course, because of our separation, Vile is now much weaker. I guess he figured it was a small price to pay for not having to listen to me anymore."
"Oh, if I had my full power, granting that would be trivial."
"I'd simply snap my fingers, and everyone in Skyrim would die. War resolved."
"Really? Power? You're a dragonborn; you already have more power than most people who aren't immense, fire-breathing monsters."
"Really? Power? Haven't you already killed enough of your foes using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic, etc.? How... uninspired."
"As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas."
"Come to think of it, I know of a win-win situation for both of us."
"There's an axe. An incredibly powerful axe. An axe powerful enough for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed."
"If you bring it to me, I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At least, not for you."
"As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow. Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn his place back at my side."
"In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that."
I... you're right of course. It can be hard to hear the winds of Kynareth when all you hear are the rabble in the temple.
Death feeds new life.
"I'm sure that, in time, this little sapling will grow into a new Gildergreen that will tower over Whiterun. Thank you."
One of the quickest ways to make some coin in Skyrim is to clear out some of the wealthier homes of their valuables.
"If you're interested, I could point out a good place that could use a little housecleaning."
What do you say?
I think we have a nice wealthy home for you to break into. Think you can clear the place of valuables and keep it quiet?
"These people just inherited some heirlooms from a relative. Good timing for us, bad timing for them, eh?"
Just got a tip on this house... should be stuffed with loot. Care to head over there and find out?
Got a message from one of my people that this place just came into some coin. Should be a good target. Want to take it?
Someone with connections to our Guild wants us to hit this place and send a message by clearing it of valuables. You want to handle it?
Good timing. The people in this home recently got one of your fellow Guild mates sent to jail. How about you make them pay for it.
You can give this house a once over. I hear they're fairly well-off and probably have lots of good stuff ripe for the picking. Sound good?
The owner of this place just got an inheritance from a relative lost in the war. Sound like something you can sink your teeth into?
Milk drinker.
You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.
What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches.
"It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war."
"Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful."
Here.
"Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby, relatively speaking."
"On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby."
Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark.
"Alftand. The point of puncture, of first entry, of the tapping."
"Delve to its limits, and Blackreach lies just beyond."
But not all can enter there. Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath the deathly rock.
"Oh, but the Dwemer had more than even Septimus expected."
"This will take time to decryptify. Be on your way, and Septimus will find  you if he has further need."
The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur.
To harness it is to know. The fundaments. The Dwemer lockbox hides it from me.
"The Elder Scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones, though. To bring about the opening."
"Dig, Dwemer, in the beyond. I'll know your lost unknown and rise to your depths."
"When the top level was built, no more could be placed. It was and is the maximal apex."
How long will it be sung? My feet were set upon the rock but it turned to mud and drew me down.
It lick the panes and smokes the glass...
The box contains the heart. The essence of a god.
"I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity."
"The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise."
"I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much."
"So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture."
Never thought I'd see you again.
We were told you may be coming.
Return when you have completed the Great Hunt.
"Greetings, fellow hunter."
Lead on.
May Hircine guide our blades.
"We follow you, hunt-master."
The Bloodmoon lights the way.
Show us the path to the prey.
Hircine chose you to lead the Great Hunt. So lead.
A sad time.
I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine.
"There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic."
"It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child."
"I want to beg his forgiveness. Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free."
Mind your own business.
We've got nothing to talk about.
Leave me alone.
"Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even existed. Did you run into any trouble?"
That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate Rikke. Now then...
That's not for you to decide. Soldier.
I wouldn't have sent you in the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it. Now then...
"Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as perhaps I should have."
But at least we ended up with the damn crown. Now then...
"By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers..."
"They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself."
"So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?"
Woof.
Woof.
"Well, well. Hello there, big man."
"Hello there, miss."
"Barbas, at your service."
"Ah, there you are. I've been waiting for you to arrive."
"Collect the Rueful Axe from Rimerock Burrow, and I believe we'll have a deal."
"Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid."
You have business with Clavicus Vile?
It's nice to be rid of that detestable dog. Things are so much more fun without his incessant preaching.
"Yes, I think you'll be just what I need."
"Very funny. My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person."
"Skyrim is now host to giant, flying lizards and two-legged cat-men... and you're surprised by me? Yes. I just talked. And am continuing to do so."
Lead the way.
"All right, then. We'll get together later."
Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal.
"I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of... nowhere."
Well... perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises.
"Thank you. Now, since he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines."
I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there.
"If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?"
"Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost... storybook."
"Ah, but it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it? I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it..."
But only if you use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.
And?
"Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining."
"Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then."
"Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend..."
"And I could absorb the spirit of poor, dead Barbas. He'd still be reunited with me."
And I'm sure Barbas doesn't want me to have that axe. He'd want it this way.
"The choice is yours, friend. We're all counting on you to make the right decision. Put him out of our misery!"
Hrmph. You're no fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun elsewhere.
"And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power. There's a whole world just waiting for me!"
"It's a shame, isn't it?"
"So, have you gotten Nettlebane back from those filthy Hagravens yet?"
Do you have the Eldergleam sap?
"Welcome, child."
Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?
What's happened to the Gildergreen is a travesty.
Please move quickly. Eldergleam awaits us.
Is it much further to the sanctuary?
I can't believe I've finally made it here.
It's like it was in my dreams.
I can almost hear its heart.
"Oh. I... well, I honestly didn't expect you to come back. Of course, I'm glad you did!"
"Now... I don't really want to touch that thing, though. Do you think you could handle the next steps?"
Wonderful. I'll use it to repair the tree. Thank you so much for all your help.
But... I can't run the Temple without the support of people who are inspired by the Gildergreen. How can this little tree bring new worshippers?
Boss was looking for you - said he'd be up at the summit. Better not keep him waiting.
Hey! Somebody get down here! Help!

Anybody there?
I know I heard something.
Hello? Who's there?

You can't hide from me forever.
I know you're here somewhere.
"When I find you, you're dead."
You afraid to fight me?
I know you can hear me!
"Come on, show yourself!"
Stay away from me!
I'm going to find you.
You won't get away.


Did you hear something?
Hello? Who's there?
Is... is someone there?

Ahh!
Now you're mine!
Thought I heard something.
Aha!
Time to end this little game!
I knew it!

Come on!
Here we go.
Hey!
Ahhh!
You're dead!
Get him!
You're mine!
"By Ysmir, you won't leave here alive!"
"Oh, no you don't!"
You're as good as dead!
Don't just stand there! Kill him!
Don't just stand there! Kill her!
Well well. Another maggot to squash beneath my boot.
Attack!
"To arms, boys! To arms!"
What in the bloody blazes?
Never should have come here...

I guess I was just hearing things.
Hmm. Nothing here after all.
Must be my imagination.
I was sure I heard something.
Must have been nothing.
Just getting jumpy I guess.
Mind's playing tricks on me...

I hope there aren't any more.
That takes care of that.
Good enough.
Teach you to mess with me.
All over now.
Phew!
That's the last of them.

Is it safe?
"Damn, where'd you go?"
Where are you hiding?
I'll find you...
Come back here!

Nobody here anymore.
Must've scared 'em off.
"Cleared out, I guess."
Guess it's all clear now.
Oh well. Must have run off.
No sign of 'em.
Nobody here now.

There you are.
There you are!
I knew I'd find you!
Can't hide from me.
"Oh, and when you find Esbern... if you think I'm paranoid... you may have some trouble getting him to trust you."
Just ask him where he was on the 30th of Frostfall. He'll know what it means.
"Ah. Indeed, indeed. I do remember."
"Delphine really is alive, then? You'd better come in then and tell me how you found me and what you want."
This'll just take a moment...
This one always sticks... there we go.
Only a couple more.
There we are!
"Come in, come in! Make yourself at home!"
Please. Come in. Musn't talk in the Ratway.
"Come in, come in. Too many ears out there."
Come in. Quickly now.
It was a cold day. The end of Frostfall is nearly winter in the Jerall Mountains.
"We heard the news at Cloud Ruler by courier, riding hard from the Imperial City."
"30th of Frostfall, 171. Thirty years ago. The Great War started that day."
The Thalmor ambassador delivered his ultimatum to the Emperor Titus Mede: the heads of every Blades agent within the Aldmeri Dominion.
"I knew, that day, that it was truly the beginning of the end."
And no doubt you're one of them. Leave me alone!
What's that you said? Dragonborn? Then... there really is hope after all?
You'd better come inside. Quickly now. Thalmor agents have been seen in the Ratway.

This looks like the way out! I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make it.
This way.
"Come on, hurry up."
Better to stick together down here.
You can't shake us off that easily. Let's see what's here!
This is it. We've found Gathrik's tomb.
Well? There must be a way through. Look around.
That's done it! Let's get in there.
My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated.
He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in.
"I know, I know... Wars to fight, dragons to confront, guild business to conduct."
Hey! What's this?
Who left that here?
"Well! Finders, keepers as they say."
"If nobody wants that, I'll take it."
Damn shame to leave that lying around.
"It's a bit worn, but I'll take it."
Looks like it's my lucky day.
Hmm. What's this?
Hey! That's my sword.
Don't touch that dagger! It's mine.
I don't think so. That axe is mine.
Keep away from that bow. It's mine.
Hands off. That's my armor now!
You're too slow. I saw it first.
I don't think so!
I saw it first! I'm taking it.
Not if I get it first.
No. It's mine!
We'll see about that.
I'm taking it anyway.
No!
I think not.
You can take it over my dead body!
"If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get."
Back off!
You'll have to take it from me.
Your blood won't bother me!
You'll have to fight me for it.
I'll hurt you if I have to.
You're too slow and stupid to take it from me.
That can be arranged.
What's all the commotion?
"They're fighting over that thing, I think."
Someone's going to get hurt.
Damn. Another fight.
Send another one in here! Send two! I don't care!
One of you get in here! I could put all of you down!
What are you waiting for? I know you want to kill me. Now's your chance!
"Ulfric's right-hand man, Galmar Stonefist, has located what he believes is the final resting place of the Jagged Crown."
We're going to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it.
The rest of my men are already assembling outside Korvanjund. I'll meet you there as soon as I finish up here.
The Stormcloaks are here in force. Stick close and follow orders so we don't stir up the whole place against us.
"Looks like the damned rebels got here first. No matter, we have the element of surprise. Prepare to move out."
"You ready, auxiliary?"
Follow me.
This isn't a damn summer picnic! Hurry up. We need to hit them before they know we're here.
"Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. Please, everyone. Enjoy."
Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. It.... I....
I think something's... wrong... I...
Charmed.
The Gourmet. Leave it to Titus to spare no expense.
I prefer a good roast duck. But your soup will do.
I've been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.
"So glad we kept you in Skyrim. Serving your Emperor was worth the wait, of course."
"You're not at all what I expected. I imagined you'd be fatter, honestly."
You've done your duty and we're all very grateful. Now... I'd like to eat.
Emperor Pelagius III.
"Now surely even you know about Pelagius' decree? On his deathbed - oh, and this was inspired - he forbade... death! That's right! Death! Outlawed!"
"Typical Imperial rot. You speak of Skyrim like you know the land, know its people. You're from Cyrodiil! You know nothing about us! Nothing!"
"Oh, I know enough. I know those trouble-making Stormcloaks refuse to submit to Imperial authority. Such seditious behavior. Why it's treason!"
"And when the elves marched into your beloved Cyrodiil, and everyone took up arms against them, wasn't that treason? Against the Dominion? Huh?"
"Why that's not the same thing at all. The Dominion were invaders. Conquerors. We had to fight them, to preserve our own way of life."
My point exactly.
"As I said, go speak with Gabriella. She's been assisting me with your next contract. This Emperor business, well... it does involve everyone."
"Dear brother. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated."
"Dear sister. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated."
"You and I have business to discuss. Ah, but you have not yet reported back to Astrid, have you? Do that, and then we shall talk."
"Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly."
How are you feeling?
"No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out."
"Had I intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
This better be important.
"There's little time for talk, what do you want?"
"Yes, yes, what is it now?"
You're quite noisy for someone who claims to be a thief.
Must you keep stopping?
What? What is it?
Glad the antidote is taking effect.
"Quickly, what did you want?"
Well? Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
"Sadly, yes. Even the townsfolk have taken to calling her [QUOTE]Grelod the Kind.[QUOTE] Her very existence has become something of a running joke."
"Grelod runs this orphanage because she's old, and set in her ways, and doesn't know any other life. These children need love, and comfort. I try..."
"But... I'm sorry, you should go. The children aren't up for adoption, and it's cruel to get their hopes up. Besides, Grelod hates... visitors."
Hello.
"Oh, hi, I'm glad I ran into you. I was wondering if..."
"Hello, ladies! Is there anything a big strong man can do for you this fine day?"
"I don't know. If you see any big strong men around, let us know, will you?"
<Laughter>
<Laughter>
"Harpies, every one of them."
"Oh, come now. Don't go away mad."
Bandits attacked and ransacked my cart. Can you help me?
My camp is nearby in the ruins of Nilheim. Get me there safely and you'll be rewarded.
"Fine, leave me to die."
Wait here. I'll be right back with your reward.
"Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with him."
"He was always a quiet lad, but lately... something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent."
"He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him."
If you could speak to him. Draw out the truth. I would be immensely grateful.
"So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his face apart so he can leave me alone."
My father doesn't know anything about me.
But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might think.
"Now, if you're going to get those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town."
That was a long time ago.
I told you. I'm done with all that. There's enough blood on these hands. I'm interested in creating things now.
The Prince of Plots usually gets what she wants. I'm surprised I'm not dead already. She must have had some reason to keep me alive so long.
"Mind my words or I'll mind them for you: I'm slave to no man, no god, and no Daedra."
"Boethiah talks about leaving your mark, a sign of your passing.... Well, you can make a mark on the world without treachery and murder."
"Whenever a man's life is saved by armor made with these hands, these hands have changed that man's destiny and his family's."
So you can tell that heartless Daedra bitch I'm done doing her dirty work.
A man who feels no fear has no heart. I know fear. But it does not control me.
"If you desire to fight me, then let's get this over with."
Hmph.
That remains to be seen.
"I desired stealth and secrecy, but you executed the task with as much subtlety as a enrage mammoth."
"But my purpose was ultimately gained. My previous champion was erased, and a new one born."
"If you can learn to be subtle in rendering death, perhaps I will share more of my power with you."
"You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about."
I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Darkness.
Ahhh. Quite fine my friend. Quite fine.
So sad what happened to young Elisif. Tragic really. Such a young and pretty girl.
"Was in over her head, I'm afraid."
But we should be done with murders in the Blue Palace. I've stepped up security around here.
"Hmm... Yes, I've heard about all that fuss. I myself know it's all a terrible, terrible misunderstanding. I'm quite sure you're innocent in all this."
"This one time only, I'll grant you special immunity for any past transgressions, real or perceived."
"But going forward, I'm sure you realize that your fate is in your own hands. And the law can not be bent for personal friendships."
May your will carve itself upon the world.
"Well, soldier? Can you do this?"
What do you say?
Elder Scrolls. Indeed.
The Empire. They absconded with them. Or so they think. The ones they saw. The ones they thought they saw.
I know of one. Forgotten. Sequestered.
"But I cannot go to it, not poor Septimus, for I... I have arisen beyond its grasp."
"I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture."
Halt in the name of the Jarl Balgruuf the Greater!
Halt in the name of the Jarl Hrongar.
That's close enough.
Where's Anuriel?
Halt in the name of the Jarl!
"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
"He wants the city this badly, he can fight me for it."
"She wants the city this badly, she can fight me for it."
She's watching over the others. Look alive now.
Somehow I doubt that will persuade them.
"Stay back, lord!"
"No, Igmund. It's too dangerous."
Stop right there! Were I can see you.
"Stay back, lord!"
I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my own sword.
I will not surrender Markarth without raising my own sword in her defense.
Riften denies the Emperor. You are here illegally. Stand down and you will be arrested and tried in the morning. Resist and you will die.
"If they want my city, they're going to have to take it from me personally."
Protect the Jarl with your lives!
Kill them all. Protect the Jarl at all costs!
As you wish.
Protect the Jarl!
Protect the Jarl with your lives!
Aye!
"Welcome to the Legion, auxiliary. Listen up."
The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again.
And Mercer Frey?
"That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our... well, in your line of work."
My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
Then... it's over and my death wasn't in vain.
"I owe you a great deal, Nightingale."
"Yes, my friend? How may I help?"
"Yes, fellow Nightingale?"
"I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber for the last quarter century."
The only possible help I've come across are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?
"My, my. What do we have here?"
It's been a number of years since I've set foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track.
So... once again the Key has been stolen and a [QUOTE]champion[QUOTE] returns it to the Sepulcher.
"Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on your head... a kiss on your cheek."
What you fail to realize is your actions were expected and represent nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.
"Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter."
But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize.
"Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth."
"I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born."
"The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam."
Here's where you need to go.
Check your map.
"Don't mock it, pup. Even the lowliest beasts can kill the weak and arrogant. We'll try more powerful enemies next, if you survive this."
"Fine. Take them and be gone. Never return here, or else you'll face my full wrath."
Are you attempting to threaten me? After I've been so hospitable?
"Well, then you won't be leaving here at all."



"Something wrong, Ahlam?"
"Are you alright, Ahlam? You haven't seemed yourself today."
"What's wrong, dear friend? You seem... distracted today."
"Oh, it's Nazeem. He's been spending more and more time fawning over the Jarl. I swear, we're hardly ever home at the same time anymore."
"It's nothing, I just... It's Nazeem. How did we get to this point, Danica? Is there no love left between us?"
"Hmm? Oh, well... To be honest, I was just thinking of Nazeem. The gap between us seems to be widening. He is just so... self-absorbed."
"Now, now, my friend. You must look on the bright side. If soldiers storm the city, there's a good chance your husband may get killed."
Let those soldiers come here! You've never seen me throw incense. I could fell a giant.
"If you don't mind me saying so, Ahlam, your husband is a damn fool. Any moment spent thinking about him is a moment wasted."
"Ahlam, let's be honest. Your husband is an arrogant, domineering buffoon. These are the words you used to describe him to me... remember?"
"Oh dearest, who cares? So your husband is a lout. The work you do here, with me, is invaluable. The people of Whiterun know your true worth."
"But it's more than that. Nazeem is obsessed with this civil war, as is all of Skyrim. I swear, it will consume us all."
"Maybe Nazeem's obsession has merit. This civil war seems so big, so unceasing... I'm afraid, Danica. Afraid for us all."
"Ha! Well, when you put it like that, it certainly puts things into perspective. But enough wallowing. And thank you, Danica."
"Oh, you are terrible. You do know that, right? Ha ha ha ha ha."
"Sir, we really must talk."
"Balgruuf, my Jarl. A word, if I may."
"I need but a moment of your time, my lord."
Speak.
What is it?
You've got sixty seconds. Go.
"Well... It's your son. Nelkir. The boy has been acting increasingly peculiar. Moreso than normal, I mean. Something really should be done..."
"We really must discuss the security here in Dragonsreach. Perhaps we could limit patrols in the city, and retain more guards here?"
"There's been talk again in the streets. A general fear that the giants may move south, and then... Well, you understand."
"One of the servants had a wonderful idea. Fireproofing Dragonsreach. In case of attack by, um... air."
"My daughter Adrianne wants to forge a new sword for you. Now, it wouldn't be a Skyforge blade, I know, but she really is quite gifted..."
I think the time might be right for another public appearance. Maybe address the patrons at the Bannered Mare? Or visit Jorrvaskr?
"Damn it, Proventus. I've got war lurking just outside my gates, and this is what you offer me? This? Begone."
"Yes, yes. Take care of it, Proventus. Whatever it is you're talking about..."
"Proventus, you're my steward. Your job is to offer me counsel. This? This is not counsel."
"Hmm... All right, yes, I see your point. Make the necessary arrangements."
"Of course, sir."
"Yes, my lord."
"As you say, my Jarl."
Don't you need my help?
"Well, I... If you're sure..."
"I'll just be on my way then. Please do be careful, and thank you."
"Well, I was only trying to help."
"Fine, I'll just save myself then. Thank you for letting me out of that cage."
"I was only trying to help you, you know!"
I hope the Caller turns you inside out!
I shall do my best.
"So you do. Thank you, this will help quite a bit."
"Good morning, wife."
"Hello, husband. You're rising late. You spent too long at the Sleeping Giant last night, didn't you?"
"Hello, husband. You slept well?"
Ah. Uh. Of course I'm not just rising. You must have been out when I woke up.
Like a stone.
"Well, I'd better get to work. I have to fix another saw blade for Gerdur's mill."
"Take care, husband."
"Expecting free information, eh? Help me deal with business first, then we'll see how I can help you."
"Besides, you look like your pockets are a little light on coin, am I right?"
"And I'm busy. You help me out, and I'll help you out. That's just how it is."
What is life's greatest illusion?
Welcome home.
I believe the Legate gave you an order. I expect you to follow it. Dismissed.
Deliver your report to Legate Rikke.
"In joining the Legion, you'll be taking an oath binding you to the service of the Emperor and thus to every citizen of the Empire."
Are you prepared to make that commitment?
Changed your mind? Decided you want to soldier for the Empire after all?
"Well, then. Repeat after me."
"[QUOTE]Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor, Titus Mede II...[QUOTE]"
"Well, then. Repeat after me."
[QUOTE]Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor...[QUOTE]
"I see... Well, the Legion will still be here when you change your mind. Rikke believes in you. And I'm starting to see why."
"Consider this. What greater glory than to serve the Emperor and his citizens here in Skyrim, in these days of greatest need?"
Gaius Maro still lives. I am surprised. I had assumed you were more... competent.

"I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods, you've come to the right person."
Hey! You dropped this back there.
You left this back there. Figured you'd be wantin' it. Here ya go.
"I think you accidentally mislaid this, dear. Here you go."
"You dropped this. Good thing I found it and not someone else, otherwise you might have lost it for good."
"You left this over there. You want it back, right? Here."
"I think you dropped this! Good thing I brought it to you, huh?"
"You should take more care, leaving things lying about. Here."
"Excuse me. You misplaced this, I believe? There you go. Take care now."
You left this over there. You're lucky - someone else might have kept it for himself. Here you go.
"Sing you a special song tonight, beautiful lass?"
"Not now, I'm working."
Bah. You're always working. Why else would I spend so much time here?
Mikael is quite the songbird. Maybe he's the reason you're here all the time.
Perhaps it's because there's no better way to face the cold Skyrim nights than with a belly full of ale?
"Aye, the bard's got talent, I'll give him that. You just make sure his music is the only thing you're admiring."
"Oh, there's a better way."
A buxom barmaid between the sheets will keeps me plenty warm.
"Better yet, she won't make my head ring the morning after."
"Oh Jon, darling. You know you're the only stone-biting, knuckle-dragging Nord for me."
Ha! That's my girl.
Saadia dear?
Oh Saadia...
"Yes, mum?"
Don't forget to polish those glasses later.
You still need to remove that blood stain. From the... incident.
"Just a reminder, sweetie - the blankets still need to be washed."
"We're running low on the Black-Briar mead. In a couple days I'll have you make a run, fetch some more."
I'll be needing you to mop the place down extra tonight. Lots of spills!
"Of course, mum."
"Oh, yes, Miss Hulda."
"Certainly, mum."
"Oh yes, mum. I'll make sure it gets done."
"Well, look at this. Another city rat crawled outside the walls. I don't suppose you've come up here to tell old Froki about your supposed Divines?"
"Just what we need. City folk barging in, probably looking for an offering to their precious Divines."
"Good. This is Skyrim, and we should honor the old ways. These foreigners don't even respect their own gods, much less Kyne and her Sacred Trials."
"They're stolen idols! Imposter gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials."
That's what an old man gets for thinking the younger generation might be interested in learning some honor.
"You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne."
"It's an old Nord Tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher."
Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials.
Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down.
"I'll anoint you with the symbol of the wolf, the crab and the skeever. This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair."
"Return when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever."
Olaf! It is time!


"So Mikael, what'll it be tonight, hmm? Something upbeat? A Breton jig maybe?"
"Mikael, son. How about something with a bit o' kick?"
"Well, I was thinking maybe something mournful. A High Elf dirge, perhaps? These are rather trying times, after all."
"You know, Hulda, there's this lovely Argonian ballad I've been studying..."
"You trying to scare off my customers, son? Lively! Keep it lively!"
"We've been down this road before, Mikael. Save the sap and sadness for your lady friends. My patrons need life! Cheeriness!"
"Hmm... Yes, you do raise a good point. What about the [QUOTE]Sweet Maidenfair from Hadleyshire[QUOTE]?"
"Alright, alright... Um... How about [QUOTE]The Guttersnipe[QUOTE]?"
I think [QUOTE]Seven Septims for Sigurd[QUOTE] will do nicely. Especially when they're in their cups.
"Well, that's not bad. But I was thinking [QUOTE]Mogo's Mead[QUOTE] really gets the place moving."
"Well then, consider it done."
"Ah! An excellent suggestion. I'll do that one, then."
Going straight through or did you want to stop somewhere along the way?
Just sit back. This won't take long.
Climb in back and we'll be off.
Sit back and enjoy the ride.
Don't be long. I can't wait around forever.
That's fine.
Where do you want to go?
Did you need something?
Ready to go?
Woah!
"I don't do charity. No gold, no ride."
You'd best hurry it up.
I can't wait here forever.
What do you suppose this is all about?
You ready to go yet?
"Here we are. Solitude. Safe and sound, as always."
"End of the road. Markarth, right on schedule."
Here we are. Whiterun. Everybody out.
"This is it. Riften, jewel of Skyrim. End of the road."
We made it. Windhelm. Hope you enjoyed the ride.
No problem.
Hold on. This can get a bit tricky.
We're almost there. Windhelm's just ahead.
That's Solitude just ahead. Only a few more minutes now.
"Ah, good. Markarth is just ahead. I'm glad to make it through the Reach one more time."
That's Whiterun up on the hill there. We'll be at the main gate before you know it.
Just a few more minutes and we'll be in Riften.
"Now, I don't want to alarm you, but there are bandits in these parts. We're safe up here, of course. Just be careful if you're ever here on foot."
"Lots of lawless folk around here. Foreigners, mostly. No offense."
"Old Embershard Mine's up there. Used to produce a lot of iron, but collapsed and taken over by criminals, I hear."
Ever taken a swim in the Illinalta? Take care you don't get nipped if you do. Folk say it's teeming with slaughterfish. Who knows what else.
"See those stones peeking through the surface? Used to be an old Imperial fort on the lake. Really! Stories say it up and sunk one day, but who knows?"
"Thieves used to hole up in Fort Snowhawk there, but they were run out. Wizards, they say. Suits me fine, so long as they mind their own by."
Hold your breath if you're superstitious. We're passing Shroud Hearth Barrow. Everyone knows spirits guard the old treasure there.
Got keen eyes? Might see nasty old Hajvarr up on White River Watch. Piece of work. Jarl should just run him out and have done with it.
"Orc town nearby. Between you and me, we should have had them out years ago."
You ever hear the one about the Breton and the bear-tamer?
"I used to play in the Yorgrim River when I was just a boy. It's true! I was never afraid of the stories about Forsaken Cave, of course."
"I wouldn't wander here alone at night. Folk go missing around Chillwind Depths, the cave just over those falls."
There's Treva's Watch. I hear bandits moved in while the steward was off fighting the war. I wonder if he ever got that sorted out?
"Between the cliff and Snapleg Cave there, I hate this stretch of road. There's an evil air up here. Getalong, horse."
"What's your sign? I was born under the Steed, as luck would have it. Really ought to visit my doomstone somtime. It's fairly near here."
"You can see Azura's Shrine for miles on a clear day. You people did a good job with that, I'll say it to anybody."
"Say what you will about the dark elves, but they did a proper job with Azura's Shrine. Can see it for miles on a clear day."
"Thalmor got their embassy up that way. If I had my way, the lot of those yellowback elves would wake up in a box back to Summerset tomorrow."
"I'm not asking, but if you happen to be the type, I hear that Kilkreath Ruin is a shrine to Merdia. You know. Daedra worship."
"Did you spot the Dwarven ruins up there? Mzinfazzle, Finchafft, Mzinchaleft? Good thing the Dwarves disappeared and stopped naming things."
We're passing Fort Sungard. Unbelievable view from up there. No wonder the Empire built a fort on that hill way back when.
"Look out, I think we have company."
I don't know if we can outrun 'em.
Did you see that?
Oh my goodness!
Whoa! They killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Yeah! Get her! Kill her!
"Imedhnain, I was just comparing the ledgers from last season."
"Not too bad, I hope?"
Worse. The loss of shipments from Forsworn attacks are really hitting us hard.
"Where's Cosnach, is that lazy idiot out drinking at the Silver-Blood Inn again? On my coin?"
"He's just waiting for the shipments, Lisbet. He'll be back as soon as they come in."
There are no shipments scheduled today. Stop covering for him!
He's my cousin. Just give him another chance. Please.
"Fine, I won't fire him, but I'm doing this for your sake. Not his."

"Where were you last night, Thonar? Busy with work or have you found some other woman who's willing to tolerate your lack of ambition?"
"I am busy keeping this family in coin and your pretty little head adorned with jewels, so I'll thank you not to question where I go at night, wife."
"Well maybe if you would finally convince Thongvor to put you in charge of the family, I wouldn't need to question you anymore."
"I'll take control of the family on my own time, Betrid. Until then, my brother remains in charge and you'll keep your mouth shut."
"Oh dear, whatever is a girl to do with such fearful brutes about her?"
"You have worked here in the Treasury House for a long time, haven't you Ildene?"
"Yes, child. Nana Ildene has taken care of the Silver-Bloods for many years...."
It's just... aren't you worried about the Forsworn? Maybe it's not safe here.
"Don't you worry Rhiada. If any Forsworn coming knocking on our door, Nana will let you know...."
Thanks Nana. I feel better now.
"You're a very pretty young woman, Rhiada."
"Why, thank you Thonar. I'm flattered."
"You're married, yes? To that young metal worker?"
"Eltrys, yes, just last season we were wed."
He's a lucky man to have such a beautiful young wife.
"Thank you, Thonar. That's generous of you to say."
"Ah, Nana Ildene, whatever would my family do without you?"
"Ah, Thonar, don't you worry. Nana Ildene isn't going anywhere."
"Um, good. We reward loyalty, you know."
"Oh, I know, Thonar. Only a mad woman would ever betray the Silver-Blood family."
"Uh, yes. Quite."
"Rhiada, did you clean the tables today? They're filthy!"
"I'm sorry, Betrid. I'll clean them right away."
"No, don't bother. You're useless, as always. I'll get Ildene to do it."
"I'm sorry, Betrid. I thought I had cleaned the tables properly."
"Oh, stop apologizing. It makes you look like an idiot. Learn to talk back a bit, girl! Why, when I was in the temple...."
"The temple, Betrid? You were one of Dibella's faithful?"
I misspoke. Never mind what I said. Now get back to work.
"Your hearts are full of grief, and my own weeps at the loss of Skjor."
But his death was avenged long ago. You have taken more lives than honor demanded.
The cycle of retaliation may continue for some time.
"Lad, I know what you've been up to."
"Lass, I know what you've been up to."
"Talos guide you, lad."
"Talos guide you, lass."
"Hello, dear husband. Have you brought more silver jewelry for me to sell?"
"Yes, I have. Adara made the rings herself. She is learning to bend the metal well."
They are perfect. Thank you both.
"How are the necklaces selling, my wife? We could make more."
I'm afraid the necklaces aren't selling well. Customers are not interested in medallions engraved with the symbols of other provinces.
"Humph. Used to be everyone in Markarth wore a necklace showing his home province, from Elsweyr to High Rock to Hammerfell and Cyrodiil..."
"We don't have travelers from Elsweyr or Hammerfell anymore, Endon. Only the natives and the Nords stay in Markarth now."
"As they always have, along with those crazed Forsworn. They've driven off the color that used to make this city great."
I need to get back to the customers. We'll talk more of this when I come home tonight.
"Care to try out a new ring, or perhaps my daughter could make you a necklace..."
"Oh, that sounds lovely."
"Kerah, do you have anything... exotic? Something no other woman in Markarth would be wearing."
I do have one set of bracelets in a style that is popular with the nobility in Sentinel.
"Sentinel? That's in Hammerfell, correct? And you say these bracelets are only worn by the nobility?"
"They are popular with the nobility there, yes. This particular bracelet is a copy of one worn by a Crown Princess."
Hmm. Maybe in a few seasons I could afford such a treasure.
"You there, pretty lady. You need some fresh meat for your family? Just look at the blood coming from this cut...."
"That's disgusting, get that rotting carcass away from me!"
What's wrong? You have to look at the blood closely to see the quality of the meat. How else will you know it's fresh?
I don't need to know if it's fresh from this distance.
Ugh. You're the most disgusting merchant I have ever seen. The guards should take you away.
"The only people I offend are cheats who don't pay me enough gold coin, or idiots who don't know good meat when I throw it at their faces."
"If you ever think of throwing meat at me, I will have you dragged off to Cidhna Mine so fast the guards will yank those filthy arms of yours off."
"What do I do to deserve such hatred? You give people good food and good prices, and all they do is insult you."
"Thongvor, I have the latest reports from Cidhna Mine and the smelter. We should go over them immediately."
"Reburrus, there is a war being fought across all of Skyrim, and you bother me with the usual mundane reports about silver?"
"Look at these figures, Thongvor! Ore yield is down by half, and the amount of silver bars being smelted is slipping even more than that."
"Oh, very well. I'll send my brother. He'll straighten this out."
"Very good, Thongvor. It relieves me to hear you say that."
"Did I hear correctly, Thonar? Is your brother really asking you to settle another dispute between Mulush and Nepos?"
"Someone has to keep the silver production running, Betrid, and that means keeping Mulush and Nepos in line once in a while."
Humph. Who's running the Silver-Bloods? You or your brother? You need to tell Thongvor that he should settle this himself or step down.
"The only thing I need to do, dear wife, is make sure profits are up, no matter what. If Thongvor won't do the dirty work, I will."
"You'll never be in charge of this family with that attitude, loving husband."
"I said no! No adventures, no theatrics, no thief-chasing!"
Changed your mind? Come with me. I'm heading to Riverwood. It's just up the road and my uncle Alvor is the blacksmith there.
"I don't blame you for being angry about it. I would be, too, in your shoes."
But it was all a mistake. You weren't supposed to be on that cart with those Stormcloak traitors.
"And the Imperial Legion needs your help, especially now, with that dragon out there somewhere, and Ulfric back on the loose."
"No. Not yet. After all, a dragon... something out of old tales and legends... no one could have expected that."
But you can bet he'll be trying to figure it out. This could shift the whole balance of the war.
"If you want to help stop that dragon, your best bet is to go to Solitude and join up with the Legion."
"Stick close. Damn rebels could be anywhere. Don't worry, though. General Tullius will have them on the run soon enough."
Well... maybe not. Dragons haven't been seen in Skyrim for an age or more.
"But wherever that dragon came from, and whatever it wants, Ulfric will get to the bottom of it. You can count on that."
"Besides, you have your own score to settle with the Empire now. And with that dragon."
"Yes, youngling. Have a seat."

Oh. Well. Good day.
"Bah. What's so good about it, hmm?"
Good morning.
Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall... so well preserved... I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akaviri sculptural relief...
"Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history."
"Yes, yes. Let's see what we have..."
"Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim."
"Here, the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War."
Ah. Of course. Not everyone has an appreciation for the artistic wonders of the world.
Let me see if I can find the right panel...
Ah. Of course. Not everyone has an appreciation for the artistic wonders of the world.
Ah. Thank you! Excellent. Now... where were we?
Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall.
"You see, here he is falling from the sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him."
"Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history."

"Look, here. In the third panel."
"The prophecy which brought the Akaviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn."
[QUOTE]When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world[QUOTE]

"[QUOTE]The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn.[QUOTE]"
"So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?"
"Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of the Nord heroes -- this is the Akaviri symbol for [QUOTE]Shout.[QUOTE]"
But... there's no way to know what Shout is meant.
"Patience, my dear. The Akaviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism."
"So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it."
Have you ever heard of such a thing? A Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
Have you ever heard of a Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
Let's go see if Esbern's right about Alduin's Wall.
"After you, Dragonborn."
"I know the area of the Reach that Esbern's talking about. Near what's now known as Karthspire, in the Karth River canyon."
"We can meet you there, or all travel together, your call."
I was afraid you were going to say that.
I guess there's nothing for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help.
"I hoped to avoid involving them in this, but we have no other choice."
"You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them in this, but it seems we have no choice."
You did? Maybe that's why I'm so sleepy now.
I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.
I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an ambush.
There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!
Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.
You have your orders. Get moving.
"But there isn't any other way through, Legate."
"Let's not jump to conclusions, soldier. The Legion always finds a way."
"Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting."
I need to ask you to stop. That... shouting... is making people nervous.
Good. Glad we straightened that out.
Can't say I've heard of any laws against... whatever that is you're doing. But I'll lock you up if I have to.
I've got my eye on you.
"Hello there, friend. Have you come to enjoy the sights and sounds of this beautiful sanctuary, as I have? Truly remarkable, isn't it?"
Amazing that such beauty could exist in a place as desolate as the volcanic tundra.
Praise Kynareth for allowing such beauty in the world.
"A truly remarkable place, isn't it?"
Kynareth humbles us with her beauty.
Don't come any closer. I don't want Kynareth to think I'm on your side.
You're gonna get me out of here?
Thanks! I thought I was going to rot in here. So what's the plan?
What's the plan?
There's more of them somewhere around here.
Thanks again.
All right.
Will do.
Good! I've got a few scores to settle.
"Great, let's go!"
Lead the way.
"I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine."
"And skillfully, too. I've been watching you for ages, it seems. You have the makings of a fine hunter."
You may even be my champion. Perhaps.
Your fealty is precious to me. I will make good use of it.
You bear my ring.
I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory.
The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary.
"Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape the hunt, but only ends up trapping himself."
"Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from his body, and make it an offering to me."
"Fly, my hunter. There are others who vie for my favor. A bit of competition. Don't dally while the prey flees."
"There is no retribution in the hunt. It is not vengeance I seek, but the blood course of a living hunt."
There are others who would gladly accept my favor.
They will hunt him while you delay. Your choice.
"You've done well, hunter."
"And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child."
Look more closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's grievances.
Good hunting.
Why? I want to watch the soldiers.
Inside the house. Now.
"Yes, papa."
"Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one."
"With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately."
"Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit."
"You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor."
"Agallon is an efficient man, and will certainly already have begun his tour of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we don't have his schedule."
"So, you've got two options. Try to find Agallon yourself, somewhere on his route between the major cities. Or... find and steal his schedule."
"You'll find that in his office, in the Legion stronghold of Dragon Bridge. It's your choice. Now go, and may Sithis speed you."
"Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to."
"You are trying my patience, citizen. Back away. Now."
What? Filthy assassin! We'll see who lies dead!
"Is that a threat? Back off, or by the Eight I'll cleave that arrogant head from its shoulders."
"I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for this. Move along."
"Maro is dead, I know. But we've got bigger problems right now!"
You're back. Good. You'll want to hear this.
"The fool went absolutely berserk! He wounded Veezara, tried to kill me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted."
"Lucan at the Riverwood Trader had his store broken into the other night. Oddly enough, barely anything's been stolen."
"Nobody trusts those mages, way up north in their college. Gods only know what they do up there."
"There have been whispers. A boy, up in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Been trying to contact... the Dark Brotherhood."
"Folk been hearing some strange stuff coming from the Aretino place. Chanting. Talk is, little Aventus is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood..."
"A little boy, Aventus Aretino, got sent to the orphanage. Now there's talk he's trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. No good can come of that..."
"I was walking by the old Aretino Residence, heard the little boy, Aventus? He was chanting. It was the Black Sacrament, I tell ya."
"Hear about the little Imperial boy, Aventus Aretino? The stupid whelp is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood..."
"Have you heard about Aventus Aretino? He's a little boy, lives in Windhelm. They say he's been trying to get in touch with the Dark Brotherhood..."
"Been talk of a little boy in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Get this - he's been trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Foolish lad..."
"I heard tell of a lad in Windhelm. Aventus Aretino. They say he's been doing the Black Sacrament, trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Damn fool."
Hmph.
Aye.
Yeah?
"What do you want, little elf?"
"Speak, elf."
"What do you want, cat?"
"What do you want, lizard?"
"What do you want, Imperial?"
What do you need?
Need something?
Yeah?
What do you want?
What're you lookin' at?
Speak.
"Yes, yes. I haven't got all day..."
Got somethin' to say?
I'm all ears.
What now...
This better be good...
What can I do for you?
"Oh, did you need something?"
Yeah?
Huh?
I'm waiting.
Out with it.
"What do you need, handsome?"
Is there... something I can do for you?
Hi there.
What can I do for you?
What do you want?
"I don't owe you money, do I?"
What are you starin' at?
"Yes, sera?"
And what might you need? Hmm?
You want something from me?
Speak quickly.
"How can I assist, hmm?"
This one needs something?
Tidings.
You have questions?
Well hello.
Y...Yes?
You want something from me?
Make it quick.
Let's hear it.
"Come, come. I haven't got all day."
Yeah? What?
Hi there.
Good morning.
Good afternoon.
Good evening.
Khajiit.
Breton.
Imperial.
Redguard.
Nord.
Argonian.
Yes?
Hmm?
Need something?
Hands off.
Stay away from that.
It's locked for a reason.
Don't even think about it.
Get away from me.
Keep your hands to yourself.
You mind swinging that somewhere else?
Put that down.
Careful with that.
Watch what you're doing.
I'm not allowed to stand on furniture.
Good day.
Aye.
Farewell.
See you.
"I'll take my leave, then."
Fight well.
I'd better get going.
It's been a pleasure.
See you around.
May you walk on warm sands.
Yeah yeah...
Safe travels.
Safe travels.
"Take care, now."
Swift hunting.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Bye.
"All right, then."
Hmm hmm.
Until next time.
Ah! It burns!
I'm on fire!
Ahh!
Leave me alone!
Get away!
Agghh!
Aaaiiee!
Mercy!
No more! I yield! I yield!
Enough!
"I'll be back, and you'll be dead!"
You win! I submit!
You've bested me!
I'll live to drink another day!
Death is highly overrated!
"Please, don't kill me!"
"Spare me, please!"
We are routed! Fall back!
I cannot best you!
Victory is yours! I submit!
I'm not sticking around to fight a dragon!
Agh...
Ugh...
Hunh...
Gah...
Nuh...
"Fall to me, dragon!"
Yearrgh!
Hyargh!

"Go down already, you bastard!"
Aghh! Just... die already!
Hsssss!
Hsssss!
I'll shatter your bones like glass!
"Die, little elf!"
"Ooh, now that one must have hurt!"
Yield!
Yield or suffer!
"Die, you sonofa..."
Filthy fetcher!
"Die, N'wah!"
This what you want? Huh?
Give up while you still can!
"Die, vampire!"
"Die, beast!"
"Die, dragon!"
Time to... finish this!
I'm going to... put you down!
Come on! Come on!
I'll have your head!
"Die, damn you!"
I'll... Kill you!
Just... stand still!
Gods... damn you!
Just... die!
Enough... of this!
I've had enough of you!
This what you want?
Ha! I think you're bleeding!
"Weren't expecting that, were you!"
Not impressed!
You're nothing!
Going to cry now? Huh?
I'll try and make this quick!
You can't win this!
Agh!
Oof!
Nargh!
Argh!
Weergh!
Yeagh!
Ha! Like the bite of a flea!
Ugh! That it? That your best?
"By Ysmir, you'll pay for that!"
Agh! Flithy n'wah!
Just a... scratch!
That the best you can do?
Damn you!
"Gods, no!"
Do your worst!
Why! Why?!
I'm prepared to negotiate my surrender!
Was it something I said?
Help!
Agh! I been wounded worse by better!
Ha! I've suffered worse during training!
That's it? That's all you've got?
Agh! Bastard!
Lucky... hit...
Son of a...
Agh! Enough! This ends now!
No!
That's... all you've got?
That your best? Huh?

"What's going on, Madanach? You wouldn't have old Grisvar killed unless you weren't planning on needing him."

You will? Thank you! Ten pinches of fire salts should give me all I need to bring this forge back to life.
"Shutting this place down would dishonor my family's heritage, but what other choice will I have?"
Amazing! These must have been very hard to come by.
"You've saved my business and warmed an old smith's heart. For that, I thank you."
A flame atronach's body might provide fire salt. They're dangerous creatures that can be summoned by wizards.
"Of course, it would be much easier to check with an alchemist. They occasionally have them for sale."
I can't believe you did that. You people are monsters!
You demand payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves.
"Here, take your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone."
"Wonderful! Remarkably well-preserved, too."
"Ah... here's the [QUOTE]blood seal.[QUOTE] Another of the lost Akaviri arts. No doubt triggered by... well, blood."
"Your blood, Dragonborn."
Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor.
"If you need help drawing some blood, let me know."
Try dripping blood onto the carving on the floor.
Look here! You see how the ancient Blades revered Reman Cyrodiil.
"This whole place appears to be a shrine to Reman. He ended the Akaviri invasion under mysterious circumstances, you recall."
"After the so-called [QUOTE]battle[QUOTE] of Pale Pass, the Akaviri went into his service. This was the foundation stone of the Second Empire."
"Gods above, what are you waiting for?"
"That's done it! Look, it's coming to life!"
You did it. There's the entrance!
"After you, Dragonborn. You should have the honor of being the first to set foot in Sky Haven Temple."
There's no telling what we might find inside!
